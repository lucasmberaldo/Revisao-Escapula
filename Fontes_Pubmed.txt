TI  - Scapular Dyskinesis: From Basic Science to Ultimate Treatment.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17082974 [doi]
LID - 2974
AB  - Background: This study intends to summarize the causes, clinical examination, and 
      treatments of scapular dyskinesis (SD) and to briefly investigate whether 
      alteration can be managed by a precision rehabilitation protocol planned on the 
      basis of features derived from clinical tests. Methods: We performed a 
      comprehensive search of PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL and EMBASE databases using 
      various combinations of the keywords "Rotator cuff", "Scapula", "Scapular 
      Dyskinesis", "Shoulder", "Biomechanics" and "Arthroscopy". Results: SD incidence 
      is growing in patients with shoulder pathologies, even if it is not a specific 
      injury or directly related to a particular injury. SD can be caused by multiple 
      factors or can be the trigger of shoulder-degenerative pathologies. In both 
      cases, SD results in a protracted scapula with the arm at rest or in motion. 
      Conclusions: A clinical evaluation of altered shoulder kinematics is still 
      complicated. Limitations in observing scapular motion are mainly related to the 
      anatomical position and function of the scapula itself and the absence of a tool 
      for quantitative SD clinical assessment. High-quality clinical trials are needed 
      to establish whether there is a possible correlation between SD patterns and the 
      specific findings of shoulder pathologies with altered scapular kinematics.

TI  - Management of scapular fractures.
PG  - 130-41
LID - 10.5435/JAAOS-20-03-130 [doi]
AB  - With the exception of displaced articular glenoid fractures, management of 
      scapular fractures has largely consisted of benign neglect, with an emphasis on 
      motion as allowed by the patient's pain. Better understanding of this injury has 
      resulted in greater acceptance of surgical management of highly displaced 
      variants. However, little agreement exists on indications for surgery, and there 
      is no clear comparative evidence on outcomes for surgically versus nonsurgically 
      managed fractures. Scapular fractures are the result of high-energy mechanisms of 
      injury, and they often occur in conjunction with other traumatic injuries. In 
      addition to performing meticulous physical and neurologic examination, the 
      surgeon should obtain plain radiographs, including AP shoulder, axillary, and 
      scapular Y views. Three-dimensional CT is used to determine accurate measurements 
      in surgical candidates. Surgical approach, technique, and timing are 
      individualized based on fracture type and other patient-related factors.

TI  - Serratus anterior and lower trapezius muscle activities during multi-joint 
      isotonic scapular exercises and isometric contractions.
PG  - 199-210
LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-49.3.80 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Proper scapular function during humeral elevation, such as upward 
      rotation, external rotation, and posterior tilting of the scapula, is necessary 
      to prevent shoulder injury. However, the appropriate intensity of rehabilitation 
      exercise for the periscapular muscles has yet to be clarified. OBJECTIVE: To 
      identify the serratus anterior, lower trapezius, infraspinatus, and posterior 
      deltoid muscle activities during 2 free-motion exercises using 3 intensities and 
      to compare these muscle activities with isometric contractions during quadruped 
      shoulder flexion and external rotation and abduction of the glenohumeral joint. 
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Health Science Laboratory. PATIENTS OR 
      OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 16 uninjured, healthy, active, male college 
      students (age = 19.5 ± 1.2 years, height = 173.1 ± 6.5 cm, weight = 68.8 ± 6.6 
      kg). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Mean electromyographic activity normalized by the 
      maximal voluntary isometric contraction was analyzed across 3 intensities and 5 
      exercises. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for 
      electromyographic activity of the 4 muscles in each free-motion exercise. 
      RESULTS: Significant interactions in electromyographic activity were observed 
      between intensities and exercises (P < .05). The quadruped shoulder-flexion 
      exercise activated all 4 muscles compared with other exercises. Also, the 
      modified robbery free-motion exercise activated the serratus anterior, lower 
      trapezius, and infraspinatus compared with the lawn-mower free-motion exercise. 
      However, neither exercise showed a difference in posterior deltoid 
      electromyographic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Three intensities exposed the nature of 
      the periscapular muscle activities across the different exercises. The 
      free-motion exercise in periscapular muscle rehabilitation may not modify 
      serratus anterior, lower trapezius, and infraspinatus muscle activities unless 
      knee-joint extension is limited.

TI  - The moment arms of the muscles spanning the glenohumeral joint: a systematic 
      review.
PG  - 1-15
LID - 10.1111/joa.12903 [doi]
AB  - The moment arm of a muscle represents its leverage or torque-producing capacity, 
      and is indicative of the role of the muscle in joint actuation. The objective of 
      this study was to undertake a systematic review of the moment arms of the major 
      muscles spanning the glenohumeral joint during abduction, flexion and axial 
      rotation. Moment arm data for the deltoid, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, 
      teres major, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis and teres minor were 
      reported when measured using the geometric and tendon excursion methods. The 
      anterior and middle sub-regions of the deltoid had the largest humeral elevator 
      moment arm values of all muscles during coronal- and scapular-plane abduction, as 
      well as during flexion. The pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi and teres major 
      had the largest depressor moment arms, with each of these muscles exhibiting 
      prominent leverage in shoulder adduction, and the latissimus dorsi and teres 
      major also in extension. The rotator cuff muscles had the largest axial rotation 
      moment arms regardless of the axial position of the humerus. The supraspinatus 
      had the most prominent elevator moment arms during early abduction in both the 
      coronal and scapular planes as well as in flexion. This systematic review shows 
      that the rotator cuff muscles function as humeral rotators and weak humeral 
      depressors or elevators, while the three sub-regions of the deltoid behave as 
      substantial humeral elevators throughout the range of humeral motion. The 
      pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi and teres major are significant shoulder 
      depressors, particularly during abduction. This study provides muscle moment arm 
      data on functionally relevant shoulder movements that are involved in tasks of 
      daily living, including lifting and pushing. The results may be useful in 
      quantifying shoulder muscle function during specific planes of movement, in 
      designing and validating computational models of the shoulder, and in planning 
      surgical procedures such as tendon transfer surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations in glenohumeral and scapulothoracic kinematics have been 
      theorized to contribute to rotator cuff pathology by impacting the magnitude of 
      the subacromial space. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to summarize what 
      is currently known about the relationship between shoulder kinematics and 
      subacromial proximities. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of methods have been used to 
      quantify subacromial proximities including photographs, MR imaging, 
      ultrasonography, and single- and bi-plane radiographs. Changes in glenohumeral 
      and scapulothoracic kinematics are associated with changes in subacromial 
      proximities. However, the magnitude and direction of a particular motion's impact 
      on subacromial proximities often vary between studies, which likely reflects 
      different methodologies and subject populations. Glenohumeral elevation angle has 
      been consistently found to impact subacromial proximities. Plane of humeral 
      elevation also impacts subacromial proximities but to a lesser degree than the 
      elevation angle. The impact of decreased scapulothoracic upward rotation on 
      subacromial proximities is not absolute, but instead depends on the angle of 
      humerothoracic elevation. The effects of scapular dyskinesis and humeral and 
      scapular axial rotations on subacromial proximities are less clear. Future 
      research is needed to further investigate the relationship between kinematics and 
      subacromial proximities using more homogenous groups, determine the extent to 
      which compression and other factors contribute to rotator cuff pathology, and 
      develop accurate and reliable clinical measures of shoulder motion.

TI  - Qualitative clinical evaluation of scapular dysfunction: a reliability study.
PG  - 550-6
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the intrarater and interrater 
      reliability of a clinical evaluation system for scapular dysfunction. No commonly 
      accepted terminology presently exists for describing the abnormal dynamic 
      scapular movement patterns that are commonly associated with shoulder injury. A 
      method of observation was devised for clinical evaluation of scapular 
      dysfunction. Blinded evaluators (2 physicians and 2 physical therapists) were 
      familiarized with the evaluation method of scapular movement patterns before 
      viewing a videotape of 26 subjects with and without scapular dysfunction. Each 
      evaluator was asked to categorize the predominant scapular movement pattern 
      observed during bilateral humeral scaption and abduction motions. Reliability was 
      assessed by a kappa coefficient. Intertester reliability (kappa = 0.4) was found 
      to be slightly lower than intratester reliability (kappa = 0.5). These results 
      indicate that, with refinement, this qualitative evaluation method may allow 
      clinicians to standardize the categorization of dynamic scapular dysfunction 
      patterns.

TI  - A clinical method for identifying scapular dyskinesis, part 1: reliability.
PG  - 160-4
LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-44.2.160 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Shoulder injuries are common in athletes involved in overhead sports, 
      and scapular dyskinesis is believed to be one causative factor in these injuries. 
      Many authors assert that abnormal scapular motion, so-called dyskinesis, is 
      related to shoulder injury, but evidence from 3-dimensional measurement studies 
      regarding this relationship is mixed. Reliable and valid clinical methods for 
      detecting scapular dyskinesis are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To determine the interrater 
      reliability of a new test designed to detect abnormal scapular motion. DESIGN: 
      Correlation design using ratings from multiple pairs of testers. SETTING: 
      University athletic training facilities. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A sample 
      of 142 athletes (from National Collegiate Athletic Association Divisions I and 
      III) participating in sports requiring intense overhead arm use. INTERVENTION(S): 
      Participants were videotaped from the posterior aspect while performing 5 
      repetitions of bilateral, weighted (1.4-kg [3-lb] or 2.3-kg [5-lb]) shoulder 
      flexion and frontal-plane abduction. Videotapes from randomly chosen participants 
      were subsequently viewed and independently rated for the presence of scapular 
      dyskinesis by 6 raters (3 pairs), with each pair rating 30 different 
      participants. Raters were trained to detect scapular dyskinesis using a 
      self-instructional format with standardized operational definitions and 
      videotaped examples of normal and abnormal motion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): 
      Scapular dyskinesis was defined as the presence of either winging or dysrhythmia. 
      Right and left sides were rated independently as normal, subtle, or obvious 
      dyskinesis. We calculated percentage of agreement and weighted kappa (kappa(w)) 
      coefficients to determine reliability. RESULTS: Percentage of agreement was 
      between 75% and 82%, and kappa(w) ranged from 0.48 to 0.61. CONCLUSIONS: The test 
      for scapular dyskinesis showed satisfactory reliability for clinical use in a 
      sample of overhead athletes known to be at increased risk for shoulder symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Overhead athletic activities and scapula dyskinesia are linked with 
      shoulder pathology; pull-ups are a common training method for some overhead 
      sports. Different pull-up techniques exist: anecdotally some are easier to 
      perform, and others linked to greater incidences of pathology. This study aims to 
      quantify scapular kinematics and external forces for three pull-up techniques, 
      thus discussing potential injury implications. DESIGN: An observational study was 
      performed with eleven participants (age=26.8±2.4 years) who regularly perform 
      pull-ups. METHODS: The upward motions of three pull-up techniques were analysed: 
      palms facing anterior, palms facing posterior and wide-grip. A skin-fixed scapula 
      tracking technique with attached retro-reflective markers was used. RESULTS: High 
      intra-participant repeatability was observed: mean coefficients of multiple 
      correlations of 0.87-1.00 in humerothoracic rotations and 0.77-0.90 for 
      scapulothoracic rotations. Standard deviations of hand force was low: <5% body 
      weight. Significantly different patterns of humerothoracic, scapulothoracic and 
      glenohumeral kinematics were observed between the pull-up techniques. The reverse 
      technique has extreme glenohumeral internal-external rotation and large deviation 
      from the scapula plane. The wide technique has a reduced range of pro/retraction 
      in the same HT plane of elevation and 90° of arm abduction with 45° external 
      rotation was observed. All these factors suggest increased sub-acromial 
      impingement risk. CONCLUSIONS: The scapula tracking technique showed high 
      repeatability. High arm elevation during pull-ups reduces sub-acromial space and 
      increases pressure, increasing the risk of impingement injury. Wide and reverse 
      pull-ups demonstrate kinematics patterns linked with increased impingement risk. 
      Weight-assisted front pull-ups require further investigation and could be 
      recommended for weaker participants.

TI  - Reduced glenohumeral rotation, external rotation weakness and scapular dyskinesis 
      are risk factors for shoulder injuries among elite male handball players: a 
      prospective cohort study.
PG  - 1327-33
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2014-093702 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To determine whether rotator cuff strength, glenohumeral joint range of 
      motion and scapular control are associated with shoulder injuries among elite 
      male handball players. METHODS: A total of 206 players in the Norwegian elite 
      handball league for men were tested prior to the 2011-2012 season. Measures 
      included: (1) glenohumeral internal and external rotation range of motion, (2) 
      isometric internal rotation, external rotation and abduction strength and (3) 
      assessment of scapular dyskinesis. Players were followed prospectively for the 
      entire regular season (30 weeks), with shoulder problems registered bi-weekly 
      using the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center Overuse Injury Questionnaire. A 
      cumulative severity score was calculated for each player based on their 
      questionnaire responses. This was used as the outcome measure in risk factor 
      analyses. RESULTS: The average prevalence of shoulder problems throughout the 
      season was 28% (95% CI 25% to 31%). The prevalence of substantial shoulder 
      problems, defined as those leading to moderate or severe reductions in handball 
      participation or performance, or to time loss, was 12% (95% CI 11% to 13%). 
      Significant associations were found between obvious scapular dyskinesis (OR 8.41, 
      95% CI 1.47 to 48.1, p<0.05), total rotational motion (OR 0.77 per 5° change, 95% 
      CI 0.56 to 0.995, p<0.05) and external rotation strength (OR 0.71 per 10 Nm 
      change, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.99, p<0.05) and shoulder injury. CONCLUSIONS: Injury 
      prevention programmes should incorporate interventions aimed at improving 
      glenohumeral rotational range of motion, external rotation strength and scapular 
      control.

PG  - 105-110. Congress of the Italian Orthopaedic Research Society
AB  - Prevalence of scapular dyskinesis varies across records, with overhead athletes 
      being more frequently affected than non-overhead athletes A number of methods 
      have been described to evaluate scapular kinematics and scapular dyskinesis. The 
      "yes/no" and the "4-type" classification systems are widely accepted and 
      diffusely used among orthopaedics and physical therapists. The inter-rater 
      reliability for both the "yes/no" and the "4-type" classification systems may be 
      different. Moreover, differences between physical therapists and orthopaedic 
      surgeons may exist. Seven examiners (2 orthopaedic surgeons and 5 physical 
      therapists) were asked to evaluate a mixed sequence of video recordings of 
      healthy subjects and patients affected by shoulder, scapular or clavicular 
      disorders and to assess scapular dyskinesis using the "yes/no" and the "4-type" 
      classification systems. Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) and weighted kappa were 
      used to measure inter-rater reliability. Twenty-four subjects were enrolled. In 
      general, the "4- type" system has higher κ values than ''yes/no'' classification 
      system and orthopaedic surgeons achieve higher reliability than physical 
      therapists for both systems. The clinical evaluation of active shoulder movements 
      permits reproducible assessment and classification of scapular dyskinesis, in 
      particular for the "4-type" classification system. The "4-type" classification 
      system can be used to assess and classify scapular dyskinesis, especially among 
      orthopaedic surgeons.

TI  - Clinical assessment of the scapula: a review of the literature.
PG  - 883-90
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091059 [doi]
AB  - Scientific evidence supporting a role for faulty scapular positioning in patients 
      with various shoulder disorders is cumulating. Clinicians who manage patients 
      with shoulder pain and athletes at risk of developing shoulder pain need to have 
      the skills to assess static and dynamic scapular positioning and dynamic control. 
      Several methods for the assessment of scapular positioning are described in 
      scientific literature. However, the majority uses expensive and specialised 
      equipment (laboratory methods), making their use in clinical practice nearly 
      impossible. On the basis of biometric and kinematic studies, guidelines for 
      interpreting the observation of static and dynamic scapular positioning pattern 
      in patients with shoulder pain are provided. At this point, clinicians can use 
      reliable clinical tests for the assessment of both static and dynamic scapular 
      positioning in patients with shoulder pain. However, this review also provides 
      clinicians several possible pitfalls when performing clinical scapular 
      evaluation. On the basis of its clinical relevance, its proven reliability, its 
      relation to body length and its applicability in a clinical setting, this review 
      recommends to assess the scapula both static (visual observation and acromial 
      distance or Baylor/double square method for shoulder protraction) and semidynamic 
      (visual observation and inclinometry for scapular upward rotation). In addition, 
      when the patient demonstrates with shoulder impingement symptoms, the scapular 
      repositioning test and scapular assistant test are recommended for relating the 
      patients' symptoms to the position or movement of the scapula.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interpretation of shoulder motion across studies has been complicated 
      due to the use of numerous scapular coordinate systems in the literature. 
      Currently, there are no simple means by which to compare scapular kinematics 
      between coordinate system definitions when data from only one coordinate system 
      is known. RESEARCH QUESTION: How do scapular kinematics vary based on the choice 
      of coordinate system and can average rotation matrices be used to accurately 
      convert kinematics between scapular local coordinate systems? METHODS: Average 
      rotation matrices derived from anatomic landmarks of 51 cadaver scapulae 
      (29 M/22 F; 59 ± 13 yrs; 26R/25 L; 171 ± 11 cm; 70 ± 19 kg; 23.7 ± 5.5 kg/m(2)) 
      were generated between three common scapular coordinate systems. Absolute angle 
      of rotation was used to determine if anatomical variability within the cadaver 
      population influenced the matrices. To quantify the predictive capability to 
      convert kinematics between the three coordinate systems, the average rotation 
      matrices were applied to scapulothoracic motion data collected from 19 human 
      subjects (10 M/9 F; 43 ± 17 yrs; 19R; 173 ± 9 cm; 71 ± 16 kg; 23.6 ± 4.5 kg/m(2)) 
      using biplane fluoroscopy. Root mean squared error (RMSE) was used to compare 
      kinematics from an original coordinate system to the kinematics expressed in each 
      alternative coordinate system. RESULTS: The choice of scapular coordinate system 
      resulted in mean differences in scapulothoracic rotation of up to 23°, with 
      overall different shapes and/or magnitudes of the curves. A single average 
      rotation matrix between any two coordinate systems achieved accurate conversion 
      of scapulothoracic kinematics to within 4° of RMSE of the known solution. The 
      average rotation matrices were independent of sex, side, decomposition sequence, 
      and motion. SIGNIFICANCE: Scapulothoracic kinematic representations vary in shape 
      and magnitude based solely on the choice of local coordinate system. The results 
      of this study enhance interpretability and reproducibility in expressing 
      scapulothoracic motion data between laboratories by providing a simple means to 
      convert data between common coordinate systems. This is necessitated by the 
      variety of available motion analysis techniques and their respective scapular 
      landmark definitions.

AB  - Although three-dimensional electromagnetic systems are widely used to evaluate 
      the 3-dimensional scapular kinematics their reliability when testing bilateral 
      upper extremity tasks is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate 
      the repeatability of the scapular kinematic analyses using the Flock of Birds 
      (FOB) system during bilateral upper extremity movements. Twenty-one volunteers 
      without shoulder problems were included (aged 24.8 years; body mass index 
      averaged 21.2 kg/m(2)) to the study. Scapular internal-external rotation, 
      upward-downward rotation, and anterior-posterior tilt was recorded during 
      bilateral arm elevation on sagittal, scapular and frontal planes. Measurements 
      were repeated at 5-7 days intervals. Intra-session and inter-session 
      repeatability were determined using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) 
      scores and standard errors of measurements (SEM). The ICC scores were found to be 
      0.81 to 0.99 for intra-session measurements and 0.60 to 0.83 for inter-session 
      measurements. The SEM scores were 0.8°-3.4° and 2°-7.2° for the intra and 
      inter-session measurements respectively. The repeatability of the FOB system was 
      excellent for the intra-session measurements, but it was weaker for the 
      inter-session measurements. These results support the use of the FOB system for 
      assessing scapular orientation but the analyses should be conducted more 
      carefully when it is applied to the longitudinal measurements.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate inter-rater reliability of a set of shoulder 
      measurements including inclinometry [shoulder range of motion (ROM)], 
      acromion-table distance and pectoralis minor muscle length (static scapular 
      positioning), upward rotation with two inclinometers (scapular kinematics) and 
      pain pressure thresholds (muscle tenderness) in middle-aged women. DESIGN: 
      Observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty symptom-free middle-aged women (first 
      cohort) were measured by two raters. All measurements with an intraclass 
      correlation coefficient (ICC) below 0.75 were retested after an additional 
      training period in a second cohort of 30 symptom-free middle-aged women. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Inter-rater reliability of all variables was measured with the 
      ICC (95% confidence interval) and standard error of measurement (SEM). RESULTS: 
      Acromion-table distance (ICC=0.91, SEM 0.22 to 0.28% of body length), pectoralis 
      minor muscle length (ICC=0.91, SEM 0.16% of body length), pain pressure 
      thresholds (ICC=0.78 to 0.85, SEM 0.39 to 0.70kg) and abduction ROM (ICC=0.77, 
      SEM 5°) showed good to excellent inter-rater reliability in the first cohort. 
      After an additional training period, forward flexion ROM showed good inter-rater 
      reliability (ICC=0.83, SEM 5°), scapular upward rotation in resting position 
      showed moderate reliability (ICC=0.52, SEM 2°), and other scaption angles showed 
      weak reliability (ICC=0.26 to 0.43, SEM 3 to 8°). CONCLUSIONS: In a battery of 
      clinical tools to evaluate factors contributing to shoulder pain, static scapular 
      positioning and pressure pain thresholds were found to have good to excellent 
      inter-rater reliability in middle-aged women. Additional training is recommended 
      for measurements with a gravity inclinometer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Handheld dynamometers (HHD) provide quick and low-cost assessments of 
      muscle strength and their use has been increasing in clinical practice. There is 
      no available data related to the validity of HHD for this measurement. OBJECTIVE: 
      To verify the concurrent validity of scapular protraction measurements using an 
      HHD. METHODS: Individuals with traumatic anterior glenohumeral instability were 
      allocated in Instability Group (n=20), healthy swimmers were allocated in 
      Athletes Group (n=19) and healthy subjects were allocated in Sedentary Group 
      (n=21). Concurrent validity was verified by the Pearson correlation test between 
      HHD and isokinetic measurements. The agreement between instruments was verified 
      by Bland-Altman plots, for each of the two HHD positions. RESULTS: A moderate 
      correlation was observed between seated (r=0.59) and lying supine HHD (r=0.54) 
      and isokinetic dynamometer measurements for the all groups. Separated group 
      analysis exhibited a strong correlation between seated HHD and isokinetic 
      dynamometer measurements in the Instability Group (r=0.80), Sedentary Group 
      (r=0.79) and Athletes Group (r=0.76). The Bland-Altman plot showed greater 
      agreement in the seated position than the lying supine position when comparing 
      measurements with the HHD and isokinetic in both the general sample and separated 
      groups. CONCLUSION: The HHD may be considered a valid tool for assessing scapular 
      protraction muscle strength among healthy athletes, non-athletes and subjects 
      with shoulder instability. We recommend to assess subjects in the seated position 
      and to be aware that the HHD tends to overestimate the peak force, compared with 
      the gold-standard isokinetic dynamometer.

TI  - Treatment of Chronic Anterior Shoulder Dislocation by Coracoid Osteotomy with or 
      without Bristow-Latarjet Procedure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical efficacy and outcomes of the coracoid 
      osteotomy with or without Bristow-Latarjet procedures in the treatment of chronic 
      anterior shoulder dislocation (CASD). METHODS: Between January 2013 and January 
      2019, 20 shoulders of 18 patients who were diagnosed with chronic anterior 
      dislocation and underwent open reduction in our trauma center were 
      retrospectively studied. Open coracoid osteotomy with Bristow-Latarjet procedures 
      were performed on 16 shoulders and open coracoid osteotomy without 
      Bristow-Latarjet procedures were performed on four shoulders. Open coracoid 
      osteotomy with or without Bristow-Latarjet procedures were chosen on the basis of 
      the stability of the shoulder after reduction. Outcomes were assessed 
      preoperatively and postoperatively with the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, 
      the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the University of 
      California Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder rating scale, and the range of motion 
      (ROM) for shoulder activity. RESULTS: There were three males and 15 females with 
      an average age of 60.94 ± 2.69 years. The time between dislocation and treatment 
      ranged from 21 to 240 days with an average of 73.3 ± 14.4 days. All patients were 
      available for a mean follow-up of 15.2 ± 4.3 months. No procedure-related death 
      or incision-related superficial or deep tissue infection was identified in all 
      cases. No iatrogenic neurovascular injuries or fractures were found in this 
      study. At the time of 12 months follow-up, the range of motion and the shoulder 
      functional evaluation (VAS [P < 0.001], ASES [P < 0.001], and UCLA score [P 
      < 0.001]) in patients who underwent Bristow-Latarjet procedures were 
      significantly improved. Subluxation after surgical procedure was found and 
      confirmed in one patient and this patient refused to undergo revision surgery. 
      According to the Samilson and Prieto classification system, 16 shoulders were 
      assessed as grade 0, three shoulders were grade 1, one shoulder was grade 2. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Coracoid osteotomy with or without Bristow-Latarjet procedure 
      yielded an acceptable clinical result in this study. This method has the 
      advantages of enlarging the exposure of surgical field, assisting reduction of 
      shoulder, and convenient conversion to Bristow-Latarjet procedure. It is an 
      efficient and reliable method for treatment of chronic anterior shoulder 
      dislocation. A 69-year-old woman diagnosed with right chronic anterior shoulder 
      dislocation with large Hill-Sachs lesion. The latarjet procedure with remplissage 
      technique was applied for this patient.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Successful treatment of shoulder disease requires an accurate 
      diagnosis. In addition to differentiated history taking, clinical examination is 
      the most important component in the diagnosis of shoulder diseases. METHOD: The 
      present video explains the common provocation tests and functional tests that are 
      used in the basic clinical examination of the shoulder. In addition to general 
      inspection and palpation, the focus is on different diagnostic tests and clinical 
      signs that improve diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSION: The present basic clinical 
      examination methods allow a structured approach to clinical issues and can be a 
      good basis, if supplemented by further specific and individual tests.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) is the gold standard to measure 
      early implant migration which is a predictive factor for implant survival. 
      PURPOSE: To validate an alternative computed tomography (CT) technique to measure 
      implant migration in shoulder arthroplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cadaver 
      proximal humerus and a scapula, which had tantalum beads incorporated within 
      them, were prepared to accept a short-stemmed humeral component and a two-pegged 
      glenoid component of a commercial total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) system. A 
      five degree of freedom micrometer and goniometer equipped rig was used to 
      translate and rotate the implant components relative to the respective bone to 
      predetermined positions. Double CT examinations were performed for each position 
      and CT motion analysis software (CTMA) was used to assess these movements. The 
      accuracy and precision of the software was estimated using the rig's micrometers 
      and goniometers as the gold standard. The technique's effective dose was also 
      assessed. RESULTS: The accuracy was in the range of 0.07-0.23 mm in translation 
      and 0.22-0.71° in rotation. The precision was in the range of 0.08-0.15 mm in 
      translation and 0.23-0.54° in rotation. The mean effective dose for the CT scans 
      was calculated to be 0.27 mSv. CONCLUSION: In this experimental setting, 
      accuracy, precision, and effective dose of the CTMA technique were found to be 
      comparable to that of RSA. Therefore, we believe clinical studies are warranted 
      to determine if CTMA is a suitable alternative to traditional RSA for migration 
      measurements in TSA.

TI  - Scapular dyskinesis type is associated with glenohumeral joint and scapular 
      kinematic alteration during pitching motion in baseball players.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Scapular dyskinesis (SD) is associated with an increased risk of 
      throwing-related shoulder injury onset, resulting in abnormalities in 
      glenohumeral joint (GH) and scapular motions during pitching. The effects of SD 
      on shoulder motion during pitching remain unknown. This study aimed to 
      investigate kinematic alterations in GH and scapular motions during pitching in 
      baseball players with type I SD. METHODS: Sixty-seven university and 
      independent-league baseball players with and without SD were included. Pitching 
      motion was measured using an optical three-dimensional motion capture system, and 
      a SD test was conducted to evaluate SD. SD was classified into types I-IV. The 
      inter-rater reliability of SD assessment was calculated using kappa coefficients. 
      Three-dimensional GH and scapular kinematics during pitching motion were 
      analyzed. RESULTS: The percentage of agreement representing the inter-rater 
      reliability of SD assessment was 77.6% (52/67; kappa coefficient: 0.72). Overall, 
      24 and 27 participants were categorized into abnormal (type I SD) and normal 
      group (type IV SD), respectively, with normal scapular motion; one individual 
      with type III SD was excluded. The abnormal group exhibited a significantly 
      increased GH external rotation angle (9°) and decreased scapular posterior tilt 
      angle (6°) during the maximum external rotation period compared with the normal 
      group. CONCLUSIONS: Baseball players in the abnormal group showed increased GH 
      motion and decreased scapular motion during pitching. The SD test for the 
      evaluation of type I SD can help predict excessive GH external rotation and 
      decreased scapular posterior tilt during pitching.

AB  - PURPOSE: The goal of the study is to determine the inter-rater agreement on 
      multiple factors that were utilized to evaluate the quality of pediatric chest 
      X-ray exams from different levels of healthcare provision in an African setting. 
      METHODS: The image quality of pediatric chest X-rays from 3 South African medical 
      centers of varying level of healthcare service were retrospectively assessed by 3 
      raters for 12 quality factors including: (1) absent body parts; (2) under 
      inspiration; (3) patient rotation; (4) scapula in the way; (5) patient 
      kyphosis/lordosis; (6) artefact/foreign body; (7) central vessel visualization; 
      (8) peripheral vessels visualization; (9) poor collimation; and (10) trachea and 
      bronchi visualization; (11) post-cardiac vessel visualization; and (12) absent or 
      wrong image orientation. Analysis was performed using the Brennan--Prediger 
      coefficient of agreement for inter-rater reliability and Cochran's Q statistic 
      and McNemar's test for inter-rater bias. RESULTS: 1077 X-rays were reviewed. The 
      least difference between observers in the frequency of the errors was noticed for 
      factors (1) absent body parts and (12) absent or wrong image orientation with 
      almost perfect agreement between raters. κ score for these two factors among all 
      raters and between each pair of raters was more than 0.95 with no significant 
      inter-rater bias. Conversely, there was poor agreement for the remaining factors 
      with the least agreed on being factor (3) patient rotation with a κ score of 
      0.23. This was followed by factors (2) under inspiration (κ score of 0.32) and 
      factors (4) scapula in the way (κ score of 0.35) respectively. There was 
      significant inter-rater bias for all these three factors. CONCLUSION: Many of the 
      factors used to assess the quality of a chest X-ray in children demonstrate poor 
      reliability despite mitigation against variations in training, standard quality 
      definitions and level of healthcare service provision. New definitions, objective 
      measures and recording tools for assessing pediatric chest radiographic quality 
      are required.

TI  - Motion analysis of the shoulder in adults: kinematics and electromyography for 
      the clinical practice.
PG  - 575-82
AB  - In this paper, the principal aspects of kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) 
      analysis of the shoulder and their potential for the every-day clinical practice 
      are described. The text reports a brief description of standard recommendations 
      for movement assessment, an overview of the main quantitative motion analysis 
      protocols and a description of the most commonly investigated scapulothoracic 
      muscles. To assess the possibility of using these protocols for clinical 
      applications, reliability and repeatability of kinematic and EMG measures were 
      investigated and reference data for scapulohumeral joint kinematics were 
      provided. The last part of the manuscript reports the integration of the 
      quantitative analysis of scapula dyskinesis within the widely accepted 
      Constant-Murley clinical score. In addition, examples of assessment of muscles 
      activity and recruitment patterns are discussed since they are crucial for the 
      clinical evaluation of common shoulder pathologies.

TI  - A systematic review of management of scapular fractures.
PG  - 497-508
AB  - There is no agreement within literature regarding management of scapula 
      fractures. Our aim was to carry out a systematic review of literature on 
      management of the scapular fractures. Our search across multiple medical 
      databases for studies on the scapular fractures until February 2014 yielded 32 
      studies. We have excluded case series <7 patients, case reports, review articles, 
      articles without abstract, observational studies and articles on fractures 
      following shoulder arthroplasty. There were 8 prospective case series and one 
      cohort study, however, majority of the included studies were retrospective 
      studies. There were 1237 patients, follow up data were available for 941 patients 
      who underwent either conservative (629) or operative management (512). 
      Non-operative management scapular body fractures had satisfactory results. The 
      scapular neck fractures displaced <10mm have satisfactory outcome following 
      non-operative management. Operative management of displaced glenoid fossa 
      fractures and scapular neck fractures displaced >10mm lead in a better functional 
      outcome.

AB  - Motion analysis systems deliver quantitative information, e.g. on the progress of 
      rehabilitation programs aimed at improving range of motion. Markerless systems 
      are of interest for clinical application because they are low-cost and easy to 
      use. The first generation of the Kinect™ sensor showed promising results in 
      validity assessment compared to an established marker-based system. However, no 
      literature is available on the validity of the new 'Kinect™ for Xbox one' 
      (KinectOne) in tracking upper body motion. Consequently, this study was conducted 
      to analyze the accuracy and reliability of the KinectOne in tracking upper body 
      motion. Twenty subjects performed shoulder abduction in frontal and scapula 
      plane, flexion, external rotation and horizontal flexion in two conditions 
      (sitting and standing). Arm and trunk motion were analyzed using the KinectOne 
      and compared to a marker-based system. Comparisons were made using Bland Altman 
      statistics and Coefficient of Multiple Correlation. On average, differences 
      between systems of 3.9±4.0° and 0.1±3.8° were found for arm and trunk motion, 
      respectively. Correlation was higher for the arm than for the trunk motion. Based 
      on the observed bias, the accuracy of the KinectOne was found to be adequate to 
      measure arm motion in a clinical setting. Although trunk motion showed a very low 
      absolute bias between the two systems, the KinectOne was not able to track small 
      changes over time. Before the KinectOne can find clinical application, further 
      research is required analyzing whether validity can be improved using a 
      customized tracking algorithm or other sensor placement, and to analyze 
      test-retest reliability.

AB  - Clinical Scenario: Assessing movement of the scapula is an important component in 
      the evaluation and treatment of the shoulder complex. Currently, gold-standard 
      methods to quantify scapular movement include invasive technique, radiation, and 
      3D motion systems. This critically appraised topic focuses on several clinical 
      assessment methods of quantifying scapular upward rotation with respect to their 
      reliability and clinical utility. Clinical Question: Is there evidence for 
      noninvasive methods that reliably assess clinical measures of scapular upward 
      rotation in subjects with or without shoulder pathologies? Summary of Key 
      Findings: Four studies were selected to be critically appraised. The quality 
      appraisal of diagnostic reliability checklist was used to score the articles on 
      methodology and consistency. Three of the 4 studies demonstrated support for the 
      clinical question. Clinical Bottom Line: There is moderate evidence to support 
      reliable clinical methods for measuring scapular upward rotation in subjects with 
      or without shoulder pathology. Strength of Recommendation: There is moderate 
      evidence to suggest there are reliable clinical measures to quantify scapular 
      upward rotation in patients with or without shoulder pathology.

AB  - Scapula dyskinesis is prevalent in athletes conducting forceful overhead 
      movements. This review summarizes our current understanding of the condition and 
      evaluates the different options for assessing dyskinesis. Current methods for 
      assessing scapula dyskinesis involve clinical observations, three-dimensional 
      kinematics and three-dimensional wing computer tomography. Clinical observation 
      is the most pragmatic method for assessing dyskinesis yielding inter-rater 
      agreement of 79% and sensitivity of 76%. Similar sensitivities have been recorded 
      using three-dimensional kinematics. Three-dimensional wing computer tomography 
      has yielded a near-perfect interclass correlation coefficient of 0.972 when used 
      to assess dyskinesis. Three-dimensional wing computer tomography, given its 
      expense, low availability, and levels of irradiation, should be reserved for 
      high-performance athletes where detailed assessments need to be made to aid 
      rehabilitation. Observational assessments should remain the main modality used 
      for general assessment.

TI  - Reliability of Performance-Based Clinical Measurements to Assess Shoulder Girdle 
      Kinematics and Positioning: Systematic Review.
PG  - 124-144
LID - 10.2522/ptj.20160088 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deviant shoulder girdle movement is suggested as an eminent factor in 
      the etiology of shoulder pain. Reliable measurements of shoulder girdle 
      kinematics are a prerequisite for optimizing clinical management strategies. 
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability, measurement 
      error, and internal consistency of measurements with performance-based clinical 
      tests for shoulder girdle kinematics and positioning in patients with shoulder 
      pain. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases were 
      systematically searched from inception to August 2015. STUDY SELECTION: Articles 
      published in Dutch, English, or German were included if they involved the 
      evaluation of at least one of the measurement properties of interest. DATA 
      EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently evaluated the methodological quality per 
      studied measurement property with the 4-point-rating scale of the COSMIN 
      (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) 
      checklist, extracted data, and assessed the adequacy of the measurement 
      properties. DATA SYNTHESIS: Forty studies comprising more than 30 clinical tests 
      were included. Actual reported measurements of the tests were categorized into: 
      (1) positional measurement methods, (2) measurement methods to determine dynamic 
      characteristics, and (3) tests to diagnose impairments of shoulder girdle 
      function. Best evidence synthesis of the tests was performed per measurement for 
      each measurement property. LIMITATIONS: All studies had significant limitations, 
      including incongruence between test description and actual reported measurements 
      and a lack of reporting on minimal important change. In general, the 
      methodological quality of the selected studies was fair to poor. CONCLUSIONS: 
      High-quality evidence indicates that measurements obtained with the Modified 
      Scapular Assistance Test are not reliable for clinical use. Sound recommendations 
      for the use of other tests could not be made due to inadequate evidence. Across 
      studies, diversity in description, performance, and interpretation of similar 
      tests was present, and different criteria were used to establish similar 
      diagnoses, mostly without taking into account a clinically meaningful context. 
      Consequently, these tests lack face validity, which hampers their clinical use. 
      Further research on validity and how to integrate a clinically meaningful context 
      of movement into clinical tests is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Movement faults are commonly observed in patients with 
      musculoskeletal pain. The Kinetic Medial Rotation Test (KMRT) is a movement 
      control test used to identify movement faults of the scapula and gleno-humeral 
      joints during arm movement. Objective tests such as the KMRT need to be reliable 
      and valid for the results to be applied across different clinical settings and 
      patient populations. The primary objective of the present study was to determine 
      the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of KMRT in subjects with and without 
      shoulder pain. METHODS: Sixty subjects were included in this study based on 
      specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two musculoskeletal physiotherapists 
      with different levels of clinical experience performed the tests. The intra-rater 
      reliability was tested in twenty asymptomatic subjects by a single assessor at 
      two week intervals. An equal number of subjects with and without shoulder pain 
      were tested by both the assessors to determine the inter-rater reliability. Both 
      components of the KMRT, the Gleno- Humeral Anterior Translation (GHAT) and the 
      Scapular Forward Tilt (SCFT) were tested. RESULTS: The Kappa values for 
      inter-rater reliability of the GHAT and SCFT were K = 0.68 & K = 0.65 
      respectively in subjects with shoulder pain. In asymptomatic subjects, the 
      inter-rater reliability of GHAT was K = 0.61 and SCFT was K = 0.85. Intra-rater 
      reliability ranged from K = 0.66 for GHAT to K = 0.87 for SCFT. CONCLUSION: Our 
      study found substantial agreement in inter-rater reliability of KMRT in subjects 
      with shoulder pain, whereas substantial to near perfect agreement was found in 
      intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of KMRT in subjects without shoulder 
      pain.

AB  - Clinical evaluation of scapular dyskinesis (SD) aims to identify abnormal 
      scapulothoracic movement, underlying causal factors, and the potential 
      relationship with shoulder symptoms. The literature proposes different methods of 
      dynamic clinical evaluation of SD, but improved reliability and agreement values 
      are needed. The present study aimed to evaluate the intrarater and interrater 
      agreement and reliability of three SD classifications: 1) 4-type classification, 
      2) Yes/No classification, and 3) scapular dyskinesis test (SDT). Seventy-five 
      young athletes, including 45 men and 30 women, were evaluated. Raters evaluated 
      the SD based on the three methods during one series of 8-10 cycles (at least 
      eight and maximum of ten) of forward flexion and abduction with an external load 
      under the observation of two raters trained to diagnose SD. The evaluation 
      protocol was repeated after 3 h for intrarater analysis. The agreement percentage 
      was calculated by dividing the observed agreement by the total number of 
      observations. Reliability was calculated using Cohen Kappa coefficient, with a 
      95% confidence interval (CI), defined by Kappa coefficient ±1.96 multiplied by 
      the measurement standard error. The interrater analyses showed an agreement 
      percentage between 80% and 95.9% and an almost perfect reliability (k>0.81) for 
      the three classification methods in all the test conditions, except the 4-type 
      and SDT classification methods, which had substantial reliability (k<0.80) in 
      shoulder abduction. Intrarater analyses showed agreement percentages between 
      80.7% and 89.3% and substantial reliability (0.67 to 0.81) for both raters in the 
      three classifications. CIs ranged from moderate to almost perfect categories. 
      This indicates that the three SD classification methods investigated in this 
      study showed high reliability values for both intrarater and interrater 
      evaluation throughout a protocol that provided SD evaluation training of raters 
      and included several repetitions of arm movements with external load during a 
      live assessment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The scapular system free flap has been increasing in popularity to 
      reconstruct short segment mandibular bony defects. It is important to assess 
      donor site morbidities systematically. METHODS: Prospective cohort study using 
      objective measures of range of motion (ROM) and shoulder strength were measured. 
      Subjective disability was evaluated with validated questionnaires-Neck Disability 
      Impairment Index and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index. RESULTS: Twenty-six 
      patients were recruited-19 with scapular tip and 7 with lateral border scapular 
      free flap. Decreased ROM on the operated side was noted for shoulder abduction, 
      shoulder flexion, and external rotation. No significant difference was noted for 
      shoulder extension. Strength was reduced for shoulder flexion, shoulder 
      abduction, and external rotation. Subjective measurements did not indicate 
      significant shoulder function disruption. CONCLUSION: Patients with scapular free 
      flap reconstruction did not experience significant shoulder morbidity. Measures 
      of shoulder ROM and power were objectively affected; however, subjective measures 
      of shoulder disability were not significantly affected.

AB  - Repetitive overhead movements have been identified as a main risk factor to 
      develop shoulder complaints with scapular muscle activity being altered. Reliable 
      assessment of muscle activity is essential to differentiate between symptomatic 
      and asymptomatic individuals. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate 
      the intra- and inter-session reliability of scapular muscle activity during 
      maximal isokinetic shoulder flexion and extension. Eleven asymptomatic adults 
      performed maximum effort isokinetic shoulder flexion and extension (concentric 
      and eccentric at 60°/s) in a test-retest design. Muscle activity of the upper and 
      lower trapezius and serratus anterior was assessed by sEMG. Root Mean Square was 
      calculated for whole ROM and single movement phases of absolute and normalized 
      muscle activity. Absolute (Bland-Altman analysis (Bias, LoA), Minimal detectable 
      change (MDC)) and relative reliability parameters (Intraclass correlation 
      coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV)/test-retest variability (TRV)) 
      were utilized for the evaluation of reproducibility. Intra-session reliability 
      revealed ICCs between 0.56 and 0.98, averaged CVs of 18% and average MDCs of 
      81mV. Inter-session reliability resulted in ICCs between 0.13 and 0.93, averaged 
      TRVs of 21%, average MDCs of 15% and systematic and random error between -8±60% 
      and 12±36%. Scapular muscle activity assessed in overhead movements can be 
      measured reliably under maximum load conditions, though variability is dependent 
      on the movement phase. Measurement variability does not exceed magnitudes of 
      altered scapular muscle activities as reported in previous studies. Therefore, 
      maximum load application is a promising approach for the evaluation of changes in 
      scapular control related to pathologies.

AB  - The aims were to compile a schematic overview of clinical scapular assessment 
      methods and critically appraise the methodological quality of the involved 
      studies. A systematic, computer-assisted literature search using Medline, CINAHL, 
      SportDiscus and EMBASE was performed from inception to October 2013. Reference 
      lists in articles were also screened for publications. From 50 articles, 54 
      method names were identified and categorized into three groups: (1) Static 
      positioning assessment (n = 19); (2) Semi-dynamic (n = 13); and (3) Dynamic 
      functional assessment (n = 22). Fifteen studies were excluded for evaluation due 
      to no/few clinimetric results, leaving 35 studies for evaluation. Graded 
      according to the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health 
      Measurement INstruments (COSMIN checklist), the methodological quality in the 
      reliability and validity domains was "fair" (57%) to "poor" (43%), with only one 
      study rated as "good". The reliability domain was most often investigated. Few of 
      the assessment methods in the included studies that had "fair" or "good" 
      measurement property ratings demonstrated acceptable results for both reliability 
      and validity. We found a substantially larger number of clinical scapular 
      assessment methods than previously reported. Using the COSMIN checklist the 
      methodological quality of the included measurement properties in the reliability 
      and validity domains were in general "fair" to "poor". None were examined for all 
      three domains: (1) reliability; (2) validity; and (3) responsiveness. 
      Observational evaluation systems and assessment of scapular upward rotation seem 
      suitably evidence-based for clinical use. Future studies should test and improve 
      the clinimetric properties, and especially diagnostic accuracy and 
      responsiveness, to increase utility for clinical practice.

AB  - Long-term follow-up of patients with adhesive capsulitis (AC) reveals that 
      approximately half of them suffer from a limited range of shoulder motion, 
      particularly external and/or internal rotation. We report the surgical technique 
      and short-term clinical outcomes of ultrasound-guided release of the thickened 
      coracohumeral (CH) ligament in 8 patients (9 shoulders) with AC. Passive external 
      rotation with the arm by the side significantly increased from an average of 18° 
      preoperatively to 47° immediately after CH ligament release. VAS and ASES scores 
      were improved at 3months follow-up in all 9 shoulders, and maintained at 6months 
      follow-up in 6 shoulders. No procedure-related adverse events developed over the 
      6-month follow-up period. Ultrasound-guided release for thickened CH ligament is 
      a reliable and effective minimally invasive surgery for persistent limited 
      external rotation due to AC of the shoulder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Revision of unstable reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) remains a 
      significant challenge. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability 
      of a new treatment-guiding classification for instability after RSA, to describe 
      the clinical outcomes of patients stabilized operatively, and to identify those 
      with higher risk of recurrence. METHODS: All patients undergoing revision for 
      instability after RSA were identified at our institution. Demographic, clinical, 
      radiographic, and intraoperative data were collected. A classification was 
      developed using all identified causes of instability after RSA and allocating 
      them to 1 of 3 defined treatment-guiding categories. Eight surgeons reviewed all 
      data and applied the classification scheme to each case. Interobserver and 
      intraobserver reliability was used to evaluate the classification scheme. 
      Preoperative clinical outcomes were compared with final follow-up in stabilized 
      shoulders. RESULTS: Forty-three revision cases in 34 patients met the inclusion 
      for study. Five patients remained unstable after revision. Persistent instability 
      most commonly occurred in persistent deltoid dysfunction and postoperative 
      acromial fractures but also in 1 case of soft tissue impingement. Twenty-one 
      patients remained stable at minimum 2 years of follow-up and had significant 
      improvement of clinical outcome scores and range of motion. Reliability of the 
      classification scheme showed substantial and almost perfect interobserver and 
      intraobserver agreement among all the participants (κ = 0.699 and κ = 0.851, 
      respectively). DISCUSSION: Instability after RSA can be successfully treated with 
      revision surgery using the reliable treatment-guiding classification scheme 
      presented herein. However, more understanding is needed for patients with greater 
      risk of recurrent instability after revision surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) provides reliable, 
      reproducible, and durable results; however, outcomes of many modern TSA systems 
      are lacking. The present study reports early to midterm results of a 
      third-generation TSA system using a traditional-length press-fit humeral stem and 
      cemented glenoid. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of TSA patients 
      with minimum 2-year clinical follow-up. Patient-reported outcome measures, 
      including Simple Shoulder Test, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Total, 
      visual analog scale for pain, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey, and Single 
      Assessment Numeric Evaluation, as well as measured active motion (forward 
      elevation, external and internal rotation), were recorded at preoperative and 
      postoperative intervals. Preoperative midglenoid axial computed tomography scans 
      were used to evaluate eccentric glenoid wear, humeral head subluxation, and 
      glenoid version. Most recent postoperative radiographs were used to evaluate 
      glenoid loosening, humeral loosening, lesser tuberosity union, and medial calcar 
      resorption. Patient satisfaction at final follow-up was reported as excellent, 
      good, satisfied, or unsatisfied. RESULTS: There were 267 patients who met 
      inclusion criteria, with a mean age of 70.9 years and mean clinical follow-up of 
      47 months. Average glenoid retroversion was 9.7°, and 27% had eccentric glenoid 
      wear. At final follow-up, measured motion and nearly all patient-reported outcome 
      measures showed significant improvements, with 75.6% of patients rating their 
      satisfaction as excellent. No patient was considered "at risk" for humeral stem 
      loosening. Glenoid radiolucencies were seen in 13.5% of shoulders (7 gross 
      loosening). Five patients were revised to reverse TSA. CONCLUSION: TSA using a 
      third-generation traditional-length press-fit stem and cemented glenoid provides 
      excellent early to midterm outcomes with low rates of loosening and high rates of 
      excellent satisfaction.

AB  - Model-based tracking, using CT and biplane fluoroscopy, allows highly accurate 
      quantification of glenohumeral motion and changes in the subacromial space. 
      Previous investigators have used custom-built biplane fluoroscopes designed 
      specifically for kinematic applications, which are available at few institutions 
      and require FDA approval prior to clinical use. The aim of this study was to 
      demonstrate the utility of an off-the-shelf clinical biplane fluoroscope for 
      kinematic applications by validating model-based tracking for measurement of 
      glenohumeral motion using an unmodified clinical system. Biplane images of each 
      shoulder of a cadaver torso were acquired at various joint positions and during 
      simulated movements along anatomical planes of motion. The pose of each humerus 
      and scapula was determined using model-based tracking and compared to a 
      bead-based gold standard. Error due to a temporal-offset between corresponding 
      biplane images, characteristic of clinical biplane systems, was determined by 
      comparison of measured and known relative position of 2 bead clusters of a 
      phantom that was imaged while moved throughout the fluoroscopy image volume. 
      Model-based tracking had global kinematic mean absolute errors of 0.27 mm and 
      0.29° (static), and 0.22-0.32 mm and 0.12-0.45° (dynamic). Glenohumeral mean 
      absolute errors were 0.39 mm and 0.45° (static), and 0.36-0.42 mm and 0.41-0.48° 
      (dynamic). The temporal-offset was predicted to add errors of 0.06-0.85 mm and 
      0.05-0.28° for cadaveric trials for the speeds examined. For defined speeds, 
      sub-millimeter and sub-degree kinematic accuracy and precision were achieved 
      using an unmodified clinical biplane fluoroscope for quantification of 
      glenohumeral motion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Lateral Scapular Slide Test is a static test used in clinical 
      settings to assess medio-lateral inferior angle displacement and scapular 
      asymmetry at three different degrees of shoulder abduction. However, there is no 
      evidence in the literature about the reliability and diagnostic accuracy of a 
      modified LSST (arm elevation in the scapular plane with loading) in a symptomatic 
      population. OBJECTIVE: To assess the intra- and inter-rater reliability, 
      agreement, and diagnostic accuracy of the MLSST ​ (Modified Lateral Scapular 
      Slide Test) in subjects with and without shoulder symptoms. A new test position 
      is examined, in which the arm is held in 90° of elevation in the scapular plane 
      with 1 kg load. DESIGN: Within day intra- and inter-rater reliability, agreement, 
      and diagnostic accuracy study. METHOD: Participants included 25 (42 ± 2.7 years) 
      subjects with shoulder symptoms and 25 (40 ± 2.1 years) asymptomatic control 
      subjects. Two raters, blinded to each other's outcomes, measured the distance 
      between the inferior scapular angle and T7 at arms by the side, hands on hips and 
      90° of arm elevation in the scapular plane with 1 kg load. Measurements were 
      performed twice, bilaterally. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), minimal 
      detectable change (MDC95%) and diagnostic accuracy were calculated. RESULTS: The 
      ICCs for intra- and inter-rater reliability were good to high in both shoulders 
      of symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. The MDC95% in the symptomatic group 
      ranged between 0.67 and 1.40 cm in the symptomatic shoulder and 0.72-1.16 cm in 
      the asymptomatic shoulder. The asymptomatic group presented a MDC95% ranging 
      between 0.63 and 1.52 cm in the dominant and 0.60-1.41 cm in the non dominant 
      shoulder. Positive and negative likelihood ratios ranged between 0.67-5.50 and 
      0.81-1.11, respectively. CONCLUSION: The MLSST had good reliability and agreement 
      properties to assess scapular position in both groups. However, no test position 
      had clinical utility as a diagnostic criterion for shoulder pathology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anterior shoulder dislocation causes injury to the inferior 
      gleno-humeral ligament (IGHL) and capsule. Clinical manoeuvres currently used to 
      evaluate the IGHL test for, and may induce, apprehension. We developed the hyper 
      extension-internal rotation (HERI) test to assess the IGHL and inferior capsule 
      without causing apprehension or inducing a risk of gleno-humeral dislocation. 
      HYPOTHESIS: The HERI test is easy to perform and reproducible, induces no risk of 
      gleno-humeral dislocation during the manoeuvre, and causes no apprehension in the 
      patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 14 fresh cadaver shoulders. Each 
      specimen was positioned supine with the lateral edge of the scapula on the table 
      and the upper limb hanging down beside the table under the effect of gravity. 
      This position produced hyperextension and internal rotation of the gleno-humeral 
      joint. For each shoulder, the range of extension (°) was measured before and 
      after isolated IGHL section. Then, we performed the HEIR test in 50 patients with 
      chronic unilateral anterior gleno-humeral instability and we compared the range 
      of extension between the normal and abnormal sides. RESULTS: In the cadaver 
      study, isolated IGHL section increased the angle of extension by a mean of 14.5° 
      (11°-18°) compared to the pre-injury values. In the clinical study, the mean 
      difference in extension angles between the normal and abnormal sides was 14.5°. 
      The patients reported no apprehension during the HERI test. CONCLUSION: The angle 
      of extension increases after section or injury of the IGHL in cadaver specimens 
      and patients, respectively. When the inferior capsule and IGHL are damaged, the 
      angle of extension increases compared to the normal side. Lesions to these 
      structures can be evaluated clinically by performing the HERI test. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: III.

AB  - This article describes the performance of a flexible resistive sensor network to 
      track shoulder motion. This system monitors every gesture of the human shoulder 
      in its range of motion except rotations around the longitudinal axis of the arm. 
      In this regard, the design considers the movement of the glenohumeral, 
      acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular, and scapulothoracic joints. The solution 
      presented in this work considers several sensor configurations and compares its 
      performance with a set of inertial measurement units (IMUs). These devices have 
      been put together in a shoulder suit with Optitrack visual markers in order to be 
      used as pose ground truth. Optimal configurations of flexible resistive sensors, 
      in terms of accuracy requirements and number of sensors, have been obtained by 
      applying principal component analysis techniques. The data provided by each 
      configuration are then mapped onto the shoulder pose by using neural network 
      algorithms. According to the results shown in this article, a set of flexible 
      resistive sensors can be an adequate alternative to IMUs for multiaxial shoulder 
      pose tracking in open spaces. Furthermore, the system presented can be easily 
      embedded in fabric or wearable devices without obstructing the user's motion.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Individuals with shoulder and upper extremity pathology often 
      present with altered scapular motion. Few studies have looked at variations in 
      scapular acceleration as a way of quantifying scapular motion. The purpose was to 
      determine the effectiveness of wireless accelerometers for detecting changes in 
      acceleration in individuals with scapular dyskinesis. MATERIALS/METHODS: 
      Twenty-seven asymptomatic college students (mean age 24 (SD ± 1.54), 65% female, 
      93% right handed) were visually screened for scapular dyskinesis using previously 
      described criteria. Of the students recruited, fifteen students were determined 
      to have scapular dyskinesis. After securing a wireless accelerometer (MyoResearch 
      3D DTS) on the dominate scapula, the participants performed five repetitions of 
      standing scaption from 0 to 140°. Linear scapular accelerations along three 
      orthogonal axes (frontal-y, transverse-z, and sagittal-x) were collected. 
      Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC(3, k)) were used to determine the 
      between day intra-rater reliability while a one-way analysis of variance was used 
      to determine differences in acceleration between those with and without 
      dyskinesis. RESULTS: There was good between day intra-rater reliability for the 
      average of all three axes (ICC = 0.79) and for the x and y axes (ICC > 0.78). 
      Reliability was poor (ICC = 0.31) for the z-axis. There was a significant 
      increase in overall acceleration of the scapula in those with dyskinesis 
      (p = .039). There was also a significant increase in acceleration along the 
      y-axis for those with dyskinesis (p = .003) but not for the other axes (p > .16). 
      CONCLUSION: Wireless accelerometers reliably quantify scapular acceleration in 
      healthy individuals. In a healthy population with dyskinesis, the overall 
      magnitude of scapular acceleration was greater when compared to a healthy group 
      without dyskinesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Investigate reliability of shoulder internal and external rotation 
      (IR, ER), abduction in internal rotation (ABIR) and combined elevation (CE) range 
      of motion tests in competitive swimmers. DESIGN: Within participants, inter- and 
      intra-examiner reliability. SETTING: Physiotherapy Department, University of 
      Melbourne, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 17 competitive swimmers (aged 12-24 years) 
      who participate in at least 5 weekly swimming sessions and two physiotherapy 
      examiners. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inter- and intra-examiner reliability of IR, 
      ER, ABIR and CE. RESULTS: Good to excellent intra-examiner reliability across 
      tests (ICCs: 0.85-0.96) with standard error of measurement (SEM)and minimal 
      detectable change at 90% confidence interval (MDC90) ranging from 2 to 5, and 
      5-12°, respectively. Good to excellent inter-examiner reliability for all tests 
      (ICCs: 0.77-0.94) except left IR (ICC: 0.65). Inter-examiner SEM and MDC90 ranged 
      from 2 to 5° and 5-12°, respectively. CONCLUSION: Shoulder range of motion tests 
      were reliable when applied by the same examiner. Inter-examiner reliability was 
      acceptable for all tests except IR, which was affected by inconsistent manual 
      scapula stabilisation between examiners.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is important to monitor progress during rehabilitation of stroke 
      patients. To that end, clinical function tests may be supported by 
      three-dimensional kinematic measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      inter- and intra-rater reliability of three-dimensional kinematic measures of 
      shoulder movements in stroke patients with reduced shoulder function. METHODS: 
      Seventeen patients were tested in three sessions by two trained raters. 
      Three-dimensional motion capture was performed of the more affected upper 
      extremity and the trunk. Measures of movements of the scapula and humerus related 
      to the trunk, the trunk related to the laboratory, the forearm related to the 
      humerus, and temporospatial measures were obtained during two reach tasks from 
      the Wolf Motor Function Test, ReachLow and ReachHigh. Inter- and intra-rater 
      reliability was quantified with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). 
      FINDINGS: In general, range of movements of scapula, shoulder, trunk and elbow 
      and movement time and reach length showed high inter-rater reliability (ICC(∞) 
      0.84-0.98) and intra-rater reliability (ICC(∞) 0.75-1.00), A minimum of five 
      trials per task were required to achieve reliable ICC estimates. INTERPRETATION: 
      Selected three-dimensional kinematic measures can be used reliably to evaluate 
      specific movements of the shoulder in stroke patients with reduced shoulder 
      function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The critical shoulder angle (CSA) has been shown to be correlated 
      with shoulder disease states. The biomechanical hypothesis to explain this 
      correlation is that the CSA changes the shear and compressive forces on the 
      shoulder. The objective of this study is to test this hypothesis by use of a 
      validated computational shoulder model. Specifically, this study assesses the 
      impact on glenohumeral biomechanics of modifying the CSA. METHODS: An inverse 
      dynamics 3-dimensional musculoskeletal model of the shoulder was used to quantify 
      muscle forces and glenohumeral joint forces. The CSA was changed by altering the 
      attachment point of the middle deltoid into a normal CSA (33°), a reduced CSA of 
      28°, and an increased CSA of 38°. Subject-specific kinematics of slow and fast 
      speed abduction in the scapular plane and slow and fast forward flexion measured 
      by a 3-dimensional motion capture system were used to quantify joint reaction 
      shear and compressive forces. RESULTS: Increasing the CSA results in increased 
      superior-inferior forces (shearing forces; integrated over the range of motion; P 
      < .05). Reducing CSA results in increased lateromedial (compressive) forces for 
      both the maximum and integrated sum of the forces over the whole motion (P < 
      .01). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Changes in the CSA modify glenohumeral joint 
      biomechanics with increasing CSA producing higher shear forces that could 
      contribute to rotator cuff overuse, whereas reducing the CSA results in higher 
      compressive forces that contribute to joint wear.

AB  - The advent of arthroscopy and the scientific study of the efficacy and accuracy 
      of that examination have led to important advances in our understanding of the 
      shoulder examination in the overhead and throwing athlete. In this review, we 
      address current physical examination techniques and how to perform them, and 
      explore their reported clinical efficacy, providing the practicing clinician with 
      a better understanding of the proper application and interpretation of the 
      shoulder examination in the overhead and throwing athlete.

TI  - Operative Fixation of Chronic Acromioclavicular Joint Dislocation With Hook Plate 
      and Modified Ligament Transfer.
PG  - S7-8
LID - 10.1097/BOT.0000000000000580 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The optimal treatment for acute dislocation of the acromioclavicular 
      (AC) joint remains unclear, and prior randomized trials did not reveal any 
      significant improvements in the operative groups. However, it is clear that some 
      patients treated nonoperatively are dissatisfied with their outcome and request 
      surgical correction. This video demonstrates one method of repair of a chronic 
      dislocation of the AC joint in a patient with significant symptomatology 
      following nonoperative treatment of a high-grade AC dislocation. METHODS: This 
      video demonstrates the open reduction of a chronically dislocated AC joint. After 
      mobilization of the distal clavicle and debridement of the joint, a step cut is 
      made in the anterior surface of the distal clavicle. The coracoacromial (CA) 
      ligament is then identified and mobilized, taking care to preserve its acromial 
      origin. An anterior acromioplasty is then performed with a microsaggital saw. The 
      AC joint is reduced, and the acromial fragment is sculpted to fit the step cut in 
      the distal clavicle, where it is then fixed with a small-fragment cancellous 
      screw in lag fashion. The blade of the hook plate is then contoured to fit under 
      the acromion (posteriorly) to hold the joint in a reduced position. The deltoid 
      is repaired with number 1 absorbable sutures, followed by a standard closure. 
      RESULTS: Results are improved and complications minimized when care is taken to 
      not avoid overreduction of the clavicle: an intraoperative radiograph, and/or 
      comparison to the opposite side, may be useful. We do not shorten or resect the 
      entire distal clavicle: this has been shown to lead to worse outcomes. We have 
      found that CA transfer with a fragment of attached acromial bone results in more 
      reliable healing than a CA transfer alone (the Weaver-Dunn transfer). DISCUSSION: 
      In the setting of a chronic AC dislocation, hook plate fixation provides 
      excellent reduction of the joint and a stable mechanical environment: this allows 
      for the optimal healing of the ligament transfer. Typically, 6-12 months 
      postoperatively, the hook plate can be removed to improve motion and reduce local 
      irritation because joint stability is then provided by the transfer with 
      bone-to-bone healing.

TI  - Effectiveness of strengthening and stretching exercises for the postural 
      correction of abducted scapulae: a review.
PG  - 567-74
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181c069d8 [doi]
AB  - Abnormal postural alignment can be detrimental to muscle function, is 
      aesthetically unpleasing, and might contribute to joint pain. It has been unclear 
      as to whether stretching or strengthening exercises can correct faulty posture 
      such as abducted scapulae. It has been postulated that short and tight scapular 
      abductor muscles or weak and lengthened scapular retractor muscles or a 
      combination cause an abducted scapulae posture and that exercise can correct this 
      condition. The purpose of this review was to compile the information on factors 
      influencing scapular position at rest, examine the effectiveness of exercise 
      interventions in altering scapular position, and make recommendations for future 
      research. When examining the different methods that have been used to determine 
      the position of the scapula, attention should be paid to their respective 
      reliability and validity. Correlational studies have failed to detect a 
      significant association between muscle strength and scapular position but found a 
      significant relationship between muscle length and scapular position. Prospective 
      intervention studies have shown that stretching the anterior chest muscles on its 
      own or in combination with strengthening the scapular retractors can alter the 
      position of the scapula at rest in individuals with abducted scapulae. Although 
      these results are encouraging, there is a dearth of high-quality studies and more 
      research is required to address the limitations of the studies. None of the 
      intervention studies measured strength or flexibility pre or post intervention, 
      so it is unclear how effective the intervention was in changing these factors and 
      the actual mechanism behind the change. To determine which component of the 
      intervention is most effective and whether the results are additive, future 
      research should include stretching only, strengthening only, and combined 
      stretching and strengthening groups. Follow-up measurements at some period after 
      completion of the intervention would also provide important information as to the 
      permanency of any changes. The practical implication is that caution must be 
      displayed when considering the promotion of strengthening exercises to try and 
      correct for abnormal scapular posture until further evidence becomes available.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of static scapular posture in overhead athletes with 
      asymptomatic shoulder injuries.
PG  - 1071-1077
LID - 10.23736/S0022-4707.17.07751-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several etiologic factors have been postulated in overhead athletes 
      according to their shoulder injuries, such as the scapular posture asymmetries. 
      The measurement of the acromion border distance has been considered as reliable 
      clinical test for evaluating the static scapula posture. The aim of this study 
      was to quantify the differences in scapular posture between the dominant and 
      non-dominant shoulders in two static positions in volleyball and swimmers 
      athletes with asymptomatic shoulder injuries using the sliding calliper device. 
      METHODS: Twenty athletes involved in volleyball and swimming sports were 
      recruited. Their mean age was 25.4±8.09 years and BMI 22.68±1.63 kg/cm2. All 
      athletes had asymptomatic traumatic shoulder injuries. Two clinical tests were 
      used to estimate scapula posture between the two groups of athletes using a 
      sliding calliper device. In the first method the distance between the posterior 
      border of the acromion in supine position and the table (AT) was measured, and in 
      the second one the distance between the posterior border of the acromion and the 
      wall (AW) was measured in standing. RESULTS: Statistical significant differences 
      found in AW position in the volleyball compared with swimmer athletes (F=8.883, 
      S=0.008, P<0.05). The difference in scapula posture in AW position was higher 
      (14.90±4.99 mm) in the volleyball than in swimmers athletes (8.34±4.84). 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings could have implications using the assessment of 
      acromion border as an outcome measure of the scapula asymmetry posture in 
      overhead athletes with asymptomatic shoulder injuries. Due to the limited sample 
      size, this study should be considered as pilot.

TI  - Concurrent validity of inclinometer measures of scapular and clavicular positions 
      in arm elevation.
PG  - 121-130
LID - 10.1080/09593985.2017.1370753 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess concurrent validity, between and within-day reliability of 
      scapular and clavicular digital inclinometer measures. DESIGN: Test-retest and 
      concurrent validity. SETTING: Laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three participants 
      with and without shoulder symptoms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Static positions of 
      scapular upward rotation, anterior/posterior tilting and clavicular elevation 
      were measured between days with an inclinometer and compared to a 3-dimensional 
      electromagnetic tracking system in different positions of sagittal plane humeral 
      elevation (neutral, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°). The two methods were compared using a 
      two-way Analysis of Variance. Linear regressions at each arm position were also 
      performed to further assess concurrent validity. RESULTS: Between-day reliability 
      demonstrated Intraclass Correlation Coefficients ≥ 0.50 for all comparisons. 
      There were statistically significant differences between methods or interactions 
      of method and arm position for clavicle elevation (p = 0.004, maximum offset 
      between methods 7.7º in the neutral position), and scapular upward rotation 
      (p = 0.001). For scapular upward rotation, the maximum difference between methods 
      was less than 2° across all humeral positions. Clavicle elevation (r = 0.67-0.82) 
      and scapular upward rotation (r = 0.57-0.81) demonstrated higher correlations 
      between measurement methods than scapular anterior/posterior tilt 
      (r = 0.10-0.67). CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent validity in assessing scapular upward 
      rotation and clavicle elevation with an inclinometer was shown when compared with 
      electromagnetic tracking. However, the inclinometer method may not have adequate 
      concurrent validity to clinically measure scapular anterior/posterior tilting.

AB  - Methods based on cutaneous markers are the most popular for the recording of 
      three dimensional scapular motion analysis. Numerous methods have been evaluated, 
      each showing different levels of accuracy and reliability. The aim of this review 
      was to report the metrological properties of 3D scapular kinematic measurements 
      using cutaneous markers and to make recommendations based on metrological 
      evidence. A database search was conducted using relevant keywords and 
      inclusion/exclusion criteria in 5 databases. 19 articles were included and 
      assessed using a quality score. Concurrent validity and reliability were analyzed 
      for each method. Six different methods are reported in the literature, each based 
      on different marker locations and post collection computations. The acromion 
      marker cluster (AMC) method coupled with a calibration of the scapula with the 
      arm at rest is the most studied method. Below 90-100° of humeral elevation, this 
      method is accurate to about 5° during arm flexion and 7° during arm abduction 
      compared to palpation (average of the 3 scapular rotation errors). Good to 
      excellent within-session reliability and moderate to excellent between-session 
      reliability have been reported. The AMC method can be improved using different or 
      multiple calibrations. Other methods using different marker locations or more 
      markers on the scapula blade have been described but are less accurate than AMC 
      methods. Based on current metrological evidence we would recommend (1) the use of 
      an AMC located at the junction of the scapular spine and the acromion, (2) the 
      use of a single calibration at rest if the task does not reach 90° of humeral 
      elevation, (3) the use of a second calibration (at 90° or 120° of humeral 
      elevation), or multiple calibrations above 90° of humeral elevation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of scapular dyskinesis is of clinical interest because it 
      is believed to be associated with pathologies of the shoulder. This study 
      investigated the feasibility of plain-film radiography in evaluating scapular 
      dyskinesis. METHODS: Subjects with unilateral disorders of the shoulder (n = 186) 
      who underwent plain-film radiography of bilateral scapulae were divided into 4 
      categories of scapular dyskinesis patterns according to the Kibler classification 
      and analyzed. Coracoid upward shift distance (CUSD), length of the scapular spine 
      line (LSS), and scapular upward rotation angle (SURA) were measured on the 
      radiographs. Intrarater and inter-rater reliability were tested, and the 
      characteristics of these parameters in each type were analyzed. The differences 
      (d) between bilateral scapulae (d-CUSD, d-LSS, and d-SURA) among the 4 categories 
      were compared. RESULTS: Intrarater and inter-rater reliability were excellent for 
      all parameters. Significant differences between the scapulae were observed in 
      CUSD in type I and in LSS in type II categories. No significant difference in any 
      of the parameters was found in type III. Compared with the other categories, 
      d-CUSD in type I and d-LSS in type II were significantly larger. The cutoff 
      values of d-CUSD and d-LSS were 1.1 mm and 1.2 mm, respectively. No significant 
      difference in d-SURA was found among the 4 categories. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      measurement of CUSD, LSS, and SURA on plain-film radiography had excellent 
      reliability. d-CUSD and d-LSS were characteristic parameters of type I and type 
      II, respectively; however, type III had no distinguishing characteristics among 
      the parameters.

AB  - Motion analysis using inertial measurement units (IMU) has emerged as an 
      alternative to optical motion capture. However, the validity and reliability of 
      upper limb measurements varies significantly between studies. The objective of 
      this study was to determine how sensor placement affects kinematic output in the 
      assessment of motion of the arm, shoulder, and scapula. IMUs were placed 
      proximally/distally on arms, and medially/laterally on the scapula, in a group of 
      eleven healthy participants, while performing nine different motion tasks. Linear 
      regressions and mixed models analysed how these different sensor placements 
      affected the estimated joint motion by establishing the linear relationship 
      between sensors placed on the same body segment. The placement of sensors 
      affected the measured kinematic output considerably, most prominent affect was 
      seen for sensor placement on scapula during flexion and abduction, and on forearm 
      during pronation/supination. The slope of the linear regression lines was 2.5 
      during flexion, 2.7 during abduction, and 1.8 for forearm pronation/supination. 
      The results of this study suggest that the forearm sensor should be placed on the 
      dorsal side of the forearm, at the distal end; the upper arm sensor should be 
      placed laterally, on the distal part of the arm; and the sensor on the scapula 
      should be placed cranially, along the spine of scapula.

AB  - The aims were to test the intraexaminer reproducibility and report the presence 
      of specific clinical variables of scapular dyskinesis in cases with trapezius 
      myalgia and healthy controls, along with general health and work ability. A total 
      of 38 cases and 23 controls were tested for scapular dyskinesis, general health, 
      and work ability, and 19 cases and 14 controls participated in the 
      reproducibility study. Intraexaminer reproducibility was good to excellent for 6 
      of 10 clinical variables (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient [ICC] 0.76-0.91; 
      kappa 0.84-1.00), and fair to good for four variables (ICC 0.42-0.74), test for 
      muscular weakness having the lowest ICC (0.42). Cases showed significantly larger 
      medial border misalignment, larger lower horizontal distance of the inferior 
      scapular angle and larger passive shoulder internal rotation, by 110% (1.02 cm), 
      15% (1.38 cm), and 8% (5.5°), respectively. Cases with the highest degree of 
      scapular dyskinesis showed reduced work ability and general health. The present 
      specific clinical variables on scapular dyskinesis showed satisfactory 
      intraexaminer reproducibility. An increased standardization must be implemented 
      to increase reproducibility of tests for muscular weakness, and the interexaminer 
      reproducibility must be tested for all variables. Finally, scapular dyskinesis in 
      cases with trapezius myalgia must be followed longitudinally for clinical 
      importance.

AB  - Kinematics, measured by 3D upper limb motion analysis (3D-ULMA), can potentially 
      increase understanding of movement patterns by quantifying individual joint 
      contributions. Reliability in children with obstetric brachial plexus palsy 
      (OBPP) has not been established. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine between 
      session reliability and measurement errors of 3D-ULMA using the acromion method 
      (AM) in children with OBPP. APPROACH: Ten participants (mean 10 years, range 7-15 
      years, Narakas classification I-III) completed 3D-ULMA on two occasions, mean 
      interval of 8.6 d (±2.8 d). Kinematic data were captured by a 4-CODA cx1 
      optoelectronic tracking system. Participants performed three trials of the 
      modified Mallet scale tasks. Local coordinate systems, segment and joint 
      rotations were defined as recommended by the International Society of 
      Biomechanics. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 2,K) and standard error 
      of measurement (SEM) were calculated for task duration, range and joint angle at 
      point of task achievement (PTA). MAIN RESULTS: Results indicated poor reliability 
      for spatiotemporal parameters and range. Moderate to excellent reliability at PTA 
      was observed in 19/60 variables (ICC: 0.77-0.98; SEM: 3.5°-10.4°). The Abduction 
      Task had the highest (ICC: 0.79-0.98; SEM: 3.5°-10.3°) with External Rotation the 
      lowest reliability. Glenohumeral and thoracohumeral elevation had the most 
      consistent reliability. Scapular protraction/retraction had consistently poor 
      reliability (ICC: 0-0.72; SEM: 3.5°-10.2°) with axial rotation also poor (ICC: 
      0.00-0.91; SEM: 6.3°-32.8°). This study determined inconsistent test-retest 
      reliability of 3D-ULMA, using AM, to track dynamic performance of functional 
      tasks in children with OBPP. It is the first study to outline measurement error 
      in this population. This information permits more reliable interpretation of 
      future studies of kinematic patterns in children with OBPP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repair of the subscapularis with reverse total shoulder arthroplasty 
      (rTSA) is controversial. The purpose of this study is to quantify rTSA outcomes 
      in patients with and without subscapularis repair to determine if there is any 
      impact on clinical outcomes. METHODS: Three hundred forty patients received rTSA 
      and had the subscapularis repaired, whereas 251 patients received rTSA and did 
      not have the subscapularis repaired. The patients were scored preoperatively and 
      at latest follow-up using the Simple Shoulder Test; University of California, Los 
      Angeles; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons; Constant; and Shoulder Pain and 
      Disability Index metrics. Motion was also measured. Mean follow-up was 37 months. 
      RESULTS: All patients showed significant improvements in pain and function after 
      treatment with rTSA. For both cohorts, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons and 
      Constant scores significantly improved, as did range of motion. The repaired 
      cohort had significantly higher postoperative scores as measured by 4 of the 5 
      metrics and significantly more internal rotation, whereas the non-repaired cohort 
      had significantly more active abduction and passive external rotation. The 
      complication rate was 7.4% (0% dislocations) for the subscapularis-repaired 
      cohort and 6.8% (1.2% dislocations) for the non-subscapularis-repaired cohort. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Significant clinical improvements were observed for both the 
      subscapularis-repaired and non-repaired cohorts, with some statistical 
      differences observed using a variety of outcome measures. Repair of the 
      subscapularis did not lead to inferior clinical outcomes as predicted by 
      biomechanical models. No difference was noted in the complication or scapular 
      notching rates between cohorts. These clinical results show that rTSA using a 
      lateralized humeral prosthesis delivers reliable clinical improvements with a low 
      risk of instability, regardless of subscapularis repair.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No previous studies have investigated whether the extent of scapular 
      dyskinesis is associated with shoulder dysfunction. This study aimed (1) to 
      establish the reliability of a scapulometer in patients with shoulder pain and 
      (2) to investigate the related factors associated with shoulder dysfunction. 
      METHODS: One hundred participants with symptomatic scapular dyskinesis were 
      recruited. Twenty-one participants were involved in the reliability study to test 
      the intrarater and inter-rater reliabilities of the scapulometer in patients with 
      shoulder pain. After demographic data and self-reported Flexilevel Scale of 
      Shoulder Function (FLEX-SF) scores were recorded, all participants were measured 
      with a scapulometer to determine the posterior displacement of the root of the 
      spine (ROS) and the inferior angle (IFA) of the scapula from the thorax. Next, 
      the participants performed 5 trials of bilateral scapular plane elevation for 
      scapular kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) data collection. Stepwise 
      multiple linear regressions were used to determine the relationships between 
      self-reported FLEX-SF scores and potential factors. In addition to scapular 
      displacement, pain level, scapular kinematics, and EMG data were included as 
      independent variables. RESULTS: The intrarater and inter-rater reliabilities of 
      the scapulometer were excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 
      0.93-0.97) and moderate to good (ICC = 0.74-0.81), respectively. The Bland-Altman 
      plots showed no systematic bias between raters in the ROS and IFA measurements. 
      Final stepwise multiple regression models showed that more ROS distance, higher 
      serratus anterior activity, and lower pain level during arm elevation were 
      associated with higher shoulder function (total R(2) = 0.253). CONCLUSION: The 
      reliability of the scapulometer in patients with shoulder pain is moderate to 
      excellent. Scapular dyskinesis may be a compensatory strategy to avoid shoulder 
      pain and improve shoulder function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowing the reliability of three-dimensional motion analysis to 
      evaluate scapular kinematics during upper limb movements is essential to plan 
      further research dedicated to understanding scapulothoracic joint movements 
      relative to the global shoulder motion. RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim of this study 
      was to assess the intra-subject as well as intra- and interrater reliability of 
      scapulothoracic joint angles during shoulder elevation in scapular plane and 
      shoulder flexion. METHODS: Twenty healthy participants (26.6 ± 3.5 years) were 
      asked to perform maximum shoulder elevation in scapular plane as well as shoulder 
      flexion. Reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient 
      (ICC) and its 95% confidence interval of scapular kinematics (rotation, tilting, 
      pro-retraction) at each degree of global motion (shoulder elevation or shoulder 
      flexion) between 0° to 150°. RESULTS: ICCs above 0.60 were accepted as good 
      indicators for reliability. Intra-subject reliability was found to be very high 
      (>0.9 for most part) for all scapulothoracic joint angles during both movements. 
      Intra- and interrater reliability also showed good reliability being above 0.60 
      for the most part (except scapula tilting during shoulder elevation). Scapular 
      kinematics showed low reliability during the respective first 10° and 20° of 
      shoulder elevation and shoulder flexion. Furthermore, decreasing reliability was 
      found above 120° of shoulder elevation or flexion. SIGNIFICANCE: This study 
      generally showed good to high levels of reliability in the range of interest 
      (20-120°) in evaluating scapula kinematics in healthy adults during shoulder 
      elevation and flexion; these results are important for future research providing 
      a better understanding of scapular kinematics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty leads to arm lengthening. Different 
      techniques have been described to determine postoperative lengthening. The 
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the acromiohumeral 
      distance (AHD) in determining arm lengthening after reverse shoulder 
      arthroplasty. METHODS: At 2 centers, 44 patients who had received an onlay design 
      reverse shoulder arthroplasty were observed for a minimum of 6 months. 
      Examination followed a standardized protocol including preoperative and 
      postoperative radiographs on anteroposterior view in neutral rotation. Two 
      orthopedic surgeons independently performed the measurements in random order. 
      RESULTS: Mean arm lengthening averaged 2.5 cm (range, 0.3-3.9 cm) according to 
      AHD measurement. Significant differences in interobserver and intraobserver 
      variability for postoperative AHD measurements were found (P < .01). The mean 
      intrapatient difference was 0.5 cm (range, 0.02-1.5 cm). CONCLUSION: According to 
      our study, the AHD is not a reliable measurement technique to determine arm 
      lengthening after reverse shoulder arthroplasty.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scapulothoracic arthrodesis (STA) is a well-established surgical 
      technique to provide scapular stabilisation in patients with facioscapulohumeral 
      dystrophy (FSHD). There is no staging or scoring systems available to guide 
      surgical decision. The aim of this study was to develop a staging system to 
      evaluate the shoulder disability in patients with FSHD to guide surgical 
      decision-making and assess its reliability among surgeons. METHODS: Fifty-seven 
      shoulders of 29 patients (15 male, 14 female) with an average age of 34.5 years 
      (13-73) were included. Six stages of the disease were defined to create a system 
      consisting of shoulder elevation, deltoid function and scapular winging. Patients 
      were assessed by two independent orthopaedic surgeons who were blind to each 
      other. Statistical analyses included mean and standard deviation for descriptive 
      variables, Pearson's correlation and Cohen's Kappa for inter- and intraobserver 
      agreement. RESULTS: Measurement of elevation showed excellent correlation in both 
      inter- and intraobserver assessment. There was substantial agreement on deltoid 
      function and moderate agreement on scapular winging. Decisions on stage showed 
      excellent agreement on interobserver and substantial agreement on intraobserver 
      assessment. Surgical decision using the stage showed excellent agreement on both 
      inter- and intraobserver assessment. CONCLUSION: This novel staging system has an 
      excellent inter observer agreement on FSHD patients' shoulder disability. This 
      would provide surgeons a beneficial tool to define patient groups that would have 
      negatively or positively affected from STA.

      subjects: A systematic review.
PG  - 546-556
LID - 10.5152/j.aott.2020.19088 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available 
      published evidence on the intra- and inter-rater reliabilities of assessment 
      methods used for identifying and measuring scapular dyskinesis (SD) in 
      asymptomatic subjects. METHODS: A systematic electronic literature search was 
      performed in PubMed, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Scopus, and the Cochrane 
      Library, and studies on the intra- and inter-rater reliabilities of physical 
      examination tests used for identifying SD in asymptomatic people were identified. 
      Methodological quality of the studies meeting the inclusion criteria was assessed 
      using the Quality Appraisal of Reliability Studies (QAREL) checklist by two 
      reviewers. The overall level of evidence of this systematic review was determined 
      by the Modified Cochrane Back Pain Criteria based on previous research which was 
      modified for reliability studies of the shoulder complex. RESULTS: The literature 
      search generated 388 results, and only 14 articles met the inclusion criteria. In 
      these studies, reliabilities of two qualitative and five quantitative methods for 
      the assessment of SD were analyzed. The QAREL checklist revealed that 12 studies 
      had moderate risk of bias and 2 had high risk of bias. Additionally, none of the 
      studies were of high quality. On the basis of the Modified Cochrane Back Pain 
      Criteria, the overall level of evidence was moderate. Most of the studies 
      including quantitative measurement methods found good to excellent inter- and 
      intra-rater reliability values. Most of the studies including qualitative methods 
      found low-to-moderate intra- and inter-rater reliability values. CONCLUSION: 
      Considering the available published evidence, there is lack of high-quality 
      studies evaluating the inter- and intra-rater reliabilities of qualitative or 
      quantitative methods used for the assessment of SD. There are no qualitative 
      methods with high reliability that are fit for clinical applications. Some 
      quantitative methods with higher reliability are present, but clinicians should 
      be aware of the methodological flaws that studies evaluating these methods suffer 
      from. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, Diagnostic study.

TI  - Measurement of Pectoralis Minor Muscle Length in Women Diagnosed With Breast 
      Cancer: Reliability, Validity, and Clinical Application.
PG  - 429-437
LID - 10.1093/ptj/pzz174 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decreased pectoralis minor muscle length is common after primary 
      breast cancer treatment and can result in an abnormal position of the scapula. 
      This position can contribute to shoulder pain and pathomechanics and can lead to 
      problems such as impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tears, and frozen shoulder. 
      Currently, there are limited reliable methods for measuring pectoralis minor 
      length. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the reliability and 
      validity of measuring pectoralis minor length in women diagnosed with breast 
      cancer. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional reliability and validity study. 
      METHODS: Bilateral pectoralis minor length (in centimeters) was assessed using a 
      palpation meter in women (N = 29) diagnosed with breast cancer by 2 licensed 
      physical therapists who were masked to the measures. Bilateral pectoralis minor 
      length was also measured using a motion capture system to assess validity. 
      RESULTS: Intratester reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC 
      [3,k] = 0.971; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.939-0.986; standard error of 
      measurement [SEM] = 0.16 cm) and intertester reliability (ICC[3,k] = 0.915; 95% 
      CI = 0.81-0.962; SEM = 0.31 cm) were excellent for the palpation meter on the 
      affected side and the unaffected side (intratester reliability: ICC[3,k] = 0.951; 
      95% CI = 0.897-0.977; SEM = 0.19 cm; intertester reliability: ICC[3,k] = 0.945; 
      95% CI = 0.877-0.975; SEM = 0.22 cm). Significant correlations were found between 
      the motion capture system and the palpation meter on the affected side (r = 0.87) 
      and the unaffected side (r = 0.81). Bland-Altman plots between the palpation 
      meter and the motion capture system demonstrated that all the measures fell 
      within the limits of agreement. LIMITATIONS: This study encountered possible 
      errors with the accuracy of the motion capture system tracking because of the 
      proximity of the markers and inherent volumetric restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      palpation meter is a reliable, valid, easily administered, and cost-effective 
      tool for assessing pectoralis minor length in women with breast cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Appropriate evaluation of scapular dyskinesis is essential for 
      therapeutic strategies. Although the current visual-based assessment is rapid and 
      practical, the reliability of this method is unsatisfactory. It is necessary to 
      adequately understand the conditions of assessment to maximize the benefit of 
      therapeutic interventions. OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of different test 
      positions on clinical assessment for scapular dyskinesis. DESIGN: Observational 
      study. SETTING: University rehabilitation department. PATIENTS: A total of 102 
      subjects diagnosed with unilateral shoulder disorder were recruited from among 
      rehabilitation outpatients from November 2015 to February 2016. METHODS: Two 
      experienced raters categorized the subjects' scapular movement pattern according 
      to Kibler et al classification by the vision-palpation method at 4 test positions 
      (at rest, and the end range of elevation in the sagittal, scapular, and coronal 
      planes). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The overall prevalence of scapular 
      dyskinesis, the distribution of types, and the reproducibility of types at the 4 
      test positions were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of scapular 
      dyskinesis was 90.08%, and the highest frequency was found at the resting 
      position. Type III was the most common type in our sample. In reproducibility 
      analysis, 21.57% of subjects presented with the same type at any position, and 
      75.49% of subjects presented with 2 types. CONCLUSIONS: Scapular dyskinesis in 
      individuals with shoulder disorder showed a high prevalence, especially at the 
      resting position. More than 1 type of scapular pattern would be present if 
      assessed at different positions. This study indicates that test positions can 
      affect the results of scapular dyskinesis assessment, and that the resting 
      position should primarily be applied. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the between-day reliability of the 
      scapular locator for measuring scapular rotations during arm elevation in 
      patients without shoulder pain/conditions/disorders. METHODS: Twenty-three 
      asymptomatic individuals were measured during 2 sessions separated by 24 hours. 
      One observer measured scapular position with a scapular locator while 
      participants held their arms at 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120° elevation in the scapular 
      plane. Three trials were performed for each arm position. RESULTS: At 30°, 
      between-day intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for all scapular rotations 
      were poor (ICC 0.10-0.40). At higher arm elevations (60°, 90°, and 120°), ICCs 
      ranged from 0.73 to 0.93 for scapular upward rotation, 0.80 to 0.87 for posterior 
      tilt, and 0.37 to 0.62 for scapular internal rotation. For all scapular 
      rotations, the standard error of measurement was less than 6°, and the smallest 
      detectable difference ranged from 11° to 18°. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate 
      good to excellent reliability for measuring scapular upward/downward rotation and 
      anterior/posterior tilt between 60° and 120° of shoulder elevation in the 
      scapular plane. However, low reliability was found for all scapular rotations at 
      30° elevation, and for scapular internal rotation at higher arm elevation.

TI  - A Biomechanical Model of the Scapulothoracic Joint to Accurately Capture Scapular 
      Kinematics during Shoulder Movements.
PG  - e0141028

AB  - The complexity of shoulder mechanics combined with the movement of skin relative 
      to the scapula makes it difficult to measure shoulder kinematics with sufficient 
      accuracy to distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. 
      Multibody skeletal models can improve motion capture accuracy by reducing the 
      space of possible joint movements, and models are used widely to improve 
      measurement of lower limb kinematics. In this study, we developed a rigid-body 
      model of a scapulothoracic joint to describe the kinematics of the scapula 
      relative to the thorax. This model describes scapular kinematics with four 
      degrees of freedom: 1) elevation and 2) abduction of the scapula on an 
      ellipsoidal thoracic surface, 3) upward rotation of the scapula normal to the 
      thoracic surface, and 4) internal rotation of the scapula to lift the medial 
      border of the scapula off the surface of the thorax. The surface dimensions and 
      joint axes can be customized to match an individual's anthropometry. We compared 
      the model to "gold standard" bone-pin kinematics collected during three shoulder 
      tasks and found modeled scapular kinematics to be accurate to within 2 mm 
      root-mean-squared error for individual bone-pin markers across all markers and 
      movement tasks. As an additional test, we added random and systematic noise to 
      the bone-pin marker data and found that the model reduced kinematic variability 
      due to noise by 65% compared to Euler angles computed without the model. Our 
      scapulothoracic joint model can be used for inverse and forward dynamics analyses 
      and to compute joint reaction loads. The computational performance of the 
      scapulothoracic joint model is well suited for real-time applications; it is 
      freely available for use with OpenSim 3.2, and is customizable and usable with 
      other OpenSim models.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether change in shoulder position between internal 
      rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) during magnetic resonance arthrography 
      (MRA) affects previously defined capsular measurements and to determine the 
      utility of rotation in the diagnosis of instability. METHODS: A retrospective 
      study was conducted of patients who received a shoulder MRA with humeral IR and 
      ER views. Patients with an arthroscopically confirmed diagnosis of instability 
      and those with clinically stable shoulders, no history of instability, and no MRA 
      findings of instability were identified and compared. Humeral rotation, glenoid 
      retroversion, humeral head subluxation, capsular length, and capsular area using 
      axial sequences of IR and ER views were recorded. Analysis compared IR, ER, and Δ 
      capsular measurements between groups using independent t tests and univariate and 
      multivariate regression. RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects who were diagnosed with 
      instability were included, along with 28 control subjects. Capsular length, 
      capsular area, and humeral subluxations were significantly greater with ER 
      compared with IR views (P < .001, P < .001, P < .001). Patients with instability 
      displayed greater ER capsular length (P = .0006) and ER capsular area (P = .005) 
      relative to controls. Multivariate logistic regression identified age, weight, 
      sex, ER capsular length, and retroversion to be significant predictors of 
      instability. ER capsular length independently predicts instability with 86% 
      sensitivity and 84% specificity. Interobserver reliability using the intraclass 
      correlation coefficient was rated good or excellent on all measurements. 
      CONCLUSION: Variance in humeral rotation during shoulder MRA significantly 
      affects capsular measurements. Rotational views increase the utility of capsular 
      measurements when assessing for instability, particularly capsular length and 
      capsular area. The implementation of ER positioning enhances the ability to 
      examine capsular changes of the shoulder joint and can assist in the diagnosis of 
      instability. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, retrospective comparative study.

LID - 10.1123/jab.2016-0034 [doi]
AB  - While synchronous movement of the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints has 
      been emphasized in previous kinematics studies, most investigations of shoulder 
      joint position sense have treated the shoulder complex as a single joint. The 
      purposes of this study were to investigate the joint position sense errors of the 
      humerothoracic, glenohumeral, and scapulothoracic joints at different elevation 
      angles and to examine whether the errors of the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic 
      joints contribute to the errors of the humerothoracic joint. Fifty-one subjects 
      with healthy shoulders were recruited. Active joint position sense of the 
      humerothoracic, glenohumeral, and scapulothoracic joints was measured at 50°, 
      70°, and 90° of humerothoracic elevation in the scapular plane. The results 
      showed that while scapulothoracic joint position sense errors were not affected 
      by target angles, there was an angle effect on humerothoracic and glenohumeral 
      errors, with errors decreasing as the target angles approached 90° of elevation. 
      The results of a multiple regression analysis revealed that glenohumeral errors 
      explained most of the variance of the humerothoracic errors and that 
      scapulothoracic errors had a weaker predictive relationship with humerothoracic 
      errors. Therefore, it may be necessary to test scapular joint position sense 
      separately in addition to the assessment of the overall shoulder joint position 
      sense.

TI  - Active Scapular Retraction and Acromiohumeral Distance at Various Degrees of 
      Shoulder Abduction.
PG  - 584-589
LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-318-17 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT:   Performing shoulder-abduction exercises with scapular retraction has 
      been theorized to reduce the potential for shoulder impingement. However, 
      objective data to support this premise are lacking. OBJECTIVE:   To evaluate the 
      influence of active scapular retraction on acromiohumeral distance (AHD) at 4 
      shoulder-abduction angles using real-time ultrasound. DESIGN:   Cross-sectional 
      study. SETTING:   University laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS:   Twenty 
      asymptomatic individuals (10 men, 10 women; age = 22.9 ± 2.8 years, height = 
      169.3 ± 9.5 cm, mass = 65.5 ± 12.9 kg) were recruited. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S):   
      Real-time ultrasound images of AHD were obtained during nonretracted and 
      retracted scapular conditions at 0°, 45°, 60°, and 90° of shoulder abduction. A 
      2-factor analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to evaluate the 
      influence of shoulder retraction on AHD across shoulder-abduction angles. 
      RESULTS:   A scapular-retraction condition × shoulder-abduction-angle interaction 
      for AHD was found ( F(3,57) = 4.56, P = .006). The AHD was smaller at 0° (10.5 
      versus 11.2 mm, respectively; t(19) = 2.22, P = .04) but larger at 90° (9.4 
      versus 8.7 mm, respectively; t(19) = -2.30, P = .04) of shoulder abduction during 
      the retracted than the nonretracted condition. No differences in AHD were 
      observed between conditions at 45° ( t(19) = 1.45, P = .16) and 60° ( t(19) = 
      1.17, P = .86) of abduction. CONCLUSIONS:   The observed differences in AHD at 0° 
      and 90° of shoulder abduction were small and did not exceed the established 
      minimal detectable change for either angle. Our findings suggest that active 
      scapular retraction during shoulder abduction has a minimal influence on AHD at 
      0° and 90° in healthy individuals. Further investigations are needed to determine 
      whether scapular retraction influences AHD in individuals with subacromial 
      impingement.

TI  - Critical shoulder angle: Measurement reproducibility and correlation with rotator 
      cuff tendon tears.
PG  - 559-62
LID - S1877-0568(16)30038-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.otsr.2016.03.017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Associations have been reported linking rotator cuff tears (RCTs) to 
      both greater lateral extension of the acromion and greater inclination of the 
      glenoid cavity. These two factors combined can be assessed using a recently 
      introduced parameter, the critical shoulder angle (CSA). The primary objective of 
      this study was to confirm the association linking a high CSA value to RCTs, and 
      the secondary objective was to assess the reproducibility of CSA measurement 
      using a goniometer. HYPOTHESIS: The null hypothesis was that the CSA value in a 
      group of patients with RCTs was not significantly different from that in patients 
      with anterior shoulder instability and a Bankart lesion, taken as the general 
      population for this study. METHODS: After a power estimation, we retrospectively 
      included 28 patients with a mean age of 55.5 years who had surgery for RCTs and 
      27 patients with a mean age of 27.2 years who underwent anterior labral repair. 
      Two surgeons used a goniometer to measure the CSA in each patient. 
      Reproducibility was assessed based on Bland-Altman plots and Pearson's 
      correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The mean CSA was significantly higher (P=0.02) 
      in the RCT group (36.4°±4.4°; range: 30°-46°) than in the labral-repair group 
      (33.3°±3.8°; range: 25°-41°). Intra-observer reproducibility was 96.7% and 
      inter-observer reproducibility was 95.5%. CONCLUSION: Our results support 
      previously published evidence that the CSA is significantly greater in patients 
      with RCTs. Thus, an anatomical difference seems to exist between patients with 
      RCTs and the general population. The CSA measured on a standard radiograph using 
      a goniometer provides a reproducible assessment of this anatomical difference. 
      LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV, case-control epidemiological study with a power 
      estimation.

TI  - Gender effect on the scapular 3D posture and kinematic in healthy subjects.
PG  - 188-96
LID - 10.1111/cpf.12212 [doi]
AB  - Populations considered for shoulder analysis are often composed of various ratios 
      of men and women. It is consequently hypothesized that gender has no significant 
      effect on the joint kinematic. However, the literature reports, for the shoulder, 
      differences in the range of motion between genders. The specific influence of 
      gender on the scapulo-thoracic kinematics has not been studied yet. The dominant 
      shoulder of two populations of men and women composed of 11 subjects each were 
      evaluated in three dimensions for three distinct motions: flexion in the sagittal 
      plane, abduction in the frontal plane and gleno-humeral internal/external 
      rotation with the arm abducted at 90°. Posture, kinematics and range of motion 
      were studied separately. For flexion and abduction and with regard to the 
      scapular kinematic, external rotation was significantly larger for women than 
      men. The differences were of at least 5° at 120° of humeral elevation. Upward 
      rotations were identical. Women also showed larger average active humero-thoracic 
      range of motion. The mean differences were of 13°, 7°, 12° and 5° for abduction, 
      flexion, internal rotation and external rotation, respectively. No difference was 
      observed between the scapular resting positions of both populations. The observed 
      differences concerning both the scapular and humeral patterns would indicate that 
      the shoulder behaviour of men and women should not be expected to be similar.

TI  - Predictors of throwing performance in amateur male cricketers: A musculoskeletal 
      approach.
PG  - 1119-1128
LID - 10.1080/17461391.2020.1819434 [doi]
AB  - Optimal throwing speed and accuracy is built on a complex interaction of multiple 
      variables. Although strength and power has been associated with throwing speed in 
      cricketers, the individual muscles that contribute to optimal function of the 
      shoulder-complex has not been adequately explored in connection with throwing 
      performance. Consequently, this study aimed to investigate the correlation 
      between musculoskeletal variables and overhead throwing performance in 
      cricketers. Thirty-two amateur male cricketers were tested using a battery of 16 
      tests (strength, flexibility, scapula positioning) as well as a throwing speed 
      (TS) and a novel accuracy test (TA). Only two of the sixteen tests were 
      correlated with throwing performance in the multiple regression analysis. 
      Non-dominant hip abduction strength correlated positively with TS (p < 0.05): on 
      average, a strength increase of 10 newtons (N) was associated with an increase in 
      TS of 0.60 km/h (95% CI: 0.12-1.08). Non-dominant pectoralis minor length 
      correlated positively with TA (p < 0.01): on average, a one-centimetre increase 
      in the length correlated to an increase, of 0.633 points (95% CI: 0.225-1.041). 
      This cross-sectional study demonstrated that from an array of musculoskeletal 
      variables, only non-dominant hip abduction strength correlated with TS, while 
      only non-dominant pectoralis minor length correlated with TA in amateur 
      cricketers.

      musicians. OBJECTIVE: To examine the intertester reliability of scapular 
      observation and 2 clinical tests for the assessment of scapular positioning in 
      musicians. DESIGN: Intertester reliability study. SETTING: University research 
      laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Thirty healthy student musicians at a 
      single university. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Two assessors performed a 
      standardized observation protocol, the measurement of the distance between the 
      posterior border of the acromion and the wall, and the modified lateral scapular 
      slide test. Each assessor was blinded to the other's findings. RESULTS: The 
      intertester reliability coefficients (kappa) for the observation in relaxed 
      position, during unloaded movement, and during loaded movement were 0.41, 0.63, 
      and 0.36, respectively. The kappa values for the observation of tilting and 
      winging at rest were 0.48 and 0.42, respectively; during unloaded movement, the 
      kappa values were 0.52 and 0.78, respectively; and with a 1-kg load, the kappa 
      values were 0.24 and 0.50, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient 
      (ICC) of the measurement of the acromial distance was 0.72 in relaxed position 
      and 0.75 with the participant actively retracting both shoulders. The ICCs for 
      the modified lateral scapular slide test varied between 0.63 and 0.58. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that the modified lateral scapular slide 
      test was not a reliable tool to assess scapular positioning in these 
      participants. Our data indicated that scapular observation in the relaxed 
      position and during unloaded abduction in the frontal plane was a reliable 
      assessment tool. The reliability of the measurement of the distance between the 
      posterior border of the acromion and the wall in healthy musicians was moderate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the influence of stabilization of 
      acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation through the modified Weaver-Dunn 
      technique and coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments using the finite element method. 
      The goal is to determine which surgical technique allows behavior that is most 
      similar to the joint, guaranteeing the necessary stability without restricting 
      joint movements for the considered conditions. METHODS: The analysis is based on 
      the three-dimensional finite element models. The control group of this study is 
      represented by a three-dimensional model of the whole structure based on finite 
      element methods. FINDINGS: The finite element models showed the stress and 
      displacement values found in the intact acromioclavicular joint and surgical 
      procedures. It was concluded that transferring the coracoacromial ligament to 
      stabilize the acromioclavicular joint did not have a positive impact on the 
      outcome. INTERPRETATION: The finite element analysis on the treatment of 
      acromioclavicular dislocation presented here provides medical teams with new 
      parameters for choosing a suitable surgical procedure in the occurrence of 
      acromioclavicular dislocation. The development and validation of the finite 
      element models allow the variation of the conditions and enables different 
      surgical configurations to be simulated.

TI  - The influence of posture and scapulothoracic orientation on the choice of humeral 
      component retrotorsion in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The literature suggests implantation of the humeral component in 
      reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) in 0°-40° of retrotorsion without 
      further specification. We hypothesized that optimal humeral component 
      retrotorsion to avoid notching and gain balanced rotational capacity would 
      depend on scapular position and posture. METHODS: We investigated 200 shoulders 
      in 100 patients with available whole-body computed tomography scans and created 
      3-dimensional models. Implantation of a humeral component in 20° of retrotorsion 
      was simulated, and a correction angle (CA) to yield perfect opposition to the 
      glenosphere was calculated. Patient-specific variables such as age, sex, posture, 
      and scapular orientation parameters were correlated with this CA. RESULTS: 
      Scapular orientation showed large interindividual differences. A highly 
      significant correlation was seen between the CA and scapular internal rotation (R 
      = 0.71, P < .001) and protraction (R = 0.39, P < .001). When the CA was adjusted 
      for glenoid retroversion, the correlation coefficient of scapular internal 
      rotation increased even further (R = 0.91, P < .001). Scapular internal rotation 
      itself showed a correlation with thoracic kyphosis (R = 0.27, P < .001), 
      protraction (R = 0.57, P < .001), tilt (R = 0.29, P < .001), and scapular 
      translation (R = -0.23, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Scapular orientation and posture 
      should be integrated into the determination process of humeral component 
      retrotorsion in RTSA. In theory, implantation of the humeral component with 
      increased retrotorsion leads to improved neutral opposition of the RTSA 
      components in patients with extensive internal rotation of the scapula. On the 
      basis of varying scapular internal rotation, we propose the distinction of 3 
      different posture types (A-C) for enhanced appraisal of scapulothoracic 
      orientation.

TI  - Neutral glenoid alignment in reverse shoulder arthroplasty does not guarantee 
      decreased risk of impingement.
PG  - 1213-1219
LID - 10.1002/jor.23730 [doi]
AB  - Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty (RSA) has gained popularity over the recent years, 
      but impingement concerns are still present. Surgeons aim to correct pre-operative 
      glenoid deformities to reduce impingement but it can be challenging without 
      assistance like patient specific guides. However, it is unclear how accurate 
      glenoid correction affects the impingement. The main objective of this study was 
      to determine whether accurate glenoid correction to neutral version and tilt can 
      reduce the risk of impingement. Two types of virtual surgeries were performed on 
      22 pre-operative arthritic shoulders: (i) "Interactive," the glenoid baseplate 
      could be placed with accuracy, and (ii) "Blind," surgeons placed the RSA 
      baseplate while they could only visualize the glenoid. The virtual models were 
      then used in an RSA biomechanical model which recorded impingement for (i) four 
      Range of Motion (ROM) tasks, (ii) ten Activities of Daily Living (ADL). The 
      "Blind" method resulted in more variable glenoid placement (version and tilt) 
      than the "Interactive" method (p = 0.001). However, both methods showed similar 
      ROM and impingement occurrence in ADLs. The results suggest it is challenging for 
      surgeons to accurately correct version and tilt on arthritic glenoids when only 
      referencing off of the face of the glenoid. However, the variable glenosphere 
      placement observed in the "Blind" method did not result in worse impingement 
      compared to the accurate "Interactive" method. This was because both methods had 
      similar inferior baseplate positioning which is more important than correcting 
      version or tilt. Implantation accuracy remains important in RSA, but 
      pre-operative planning should not just target at correcting version and tilt. ©

AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze and compare the diagnostic value and interpretation of 6 
      established clinical tests for infraspinatus tendon tears; to assess their 
      ability to distinguish between partial- and full-thickness tears of the 
      infraspinatus tendon; and to investigate whether conducting multiple tests 
      increases the precision of diagnosis. METHODS: A total of 91 patients scheduled 
      for shoulder arthroscopy from March 2015 to April 2017 were included in the 
      present study. To assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative 
      predictive values, accuracy, diagnostic odds ratio, positive and negative 
      likelihood ratios, and the area under the curve (AUC), intraoperative findings 
      were compared with the results of 6 established clinical infraspinatus tests: the 
      hornblower's test, the drop sign, the Patte sign, the external rotation lag sign 
      (ERLS), the resisted external rotation test (RERT), and the infraspinatus 
      scapular retraction test. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between 
      the results of the drop sign (P = .02), the ERLS (P = .02), and the RERT (P = 
      .02) and the intraoperative findings. The RERT achieved the highest AUC (0.673). 
      Assessing muscle weakness led to the highest diagnostic precision on the RERT 
      (AUC = 0.673) as compared with pain (AUC = 0.528) or using both criteria (AUC = 
      0.655). No single clinical test was found to be useful in distinguishing between 
      partial- and full-thickness tears. The combination of at least 2 or more tests 
      improved the diagnostic precision significantly (P ≤ .007). The combination of 
      the RERT and the Patte sign showed the best AUC (0.681) and highest correlation 
      with the intraoperative findings (P = .023). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the 
      present study indicate that out of all the clinical tests investigated, the drop 
      sign and the RERT were in isolation able to accurately diagnose tears of the 
      infraspinatus tendon. Only muscle weakness should be considered when interpreting 
      the RERT because of its greater AUC values and correlation with the arthroscopic 
      findings. The present study also showed that the analyzed tests are not capable 
      of distinguishing between partial- and full-thickness tears of the infraspinatus 
      tendon and that the combination of at least 2 tests improved the diagnostic 
      value. The combination of the RERT and the Patte sign showed the best AUC and 
      highest correlation with the intraoperative findings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 
      II, diagnostic study, prospective comparative study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Suprascapular nerve repair is a widely-prioritized procedure for 
      shoulder reconstruction following brachial plexus injury. Although this procedure 
      only reconstructs glenohumeral joint motion, the standard clinical assessment of 
      shoulder function also includes the scapulothoracic joint contribution. The 
      purpose of this preliminary study was to develop an objective method to 
      accurately analyze shoulder abduction following suprascapular nerve repair in 
      brachial plexus injury patients. METHODS: We introduced an objective method to 
      accurately analyze independent shoulder abduction performed by supraspinatus 
      muscle with the help of dynamic shoulder radiography. Antero-posterior 
      radiographs of both shoulders in adduction and maximal active abduction were 
      obtained. Five parameters were measured. They included global abduction, 
      abduction in glenohumeral, scapulothoracic and clavicular joints along with 
      lateral flexion of thoracic spine. Data were analyzed to distinguish glenohumeral 
      joint contribution from that of scapulothoracic motion. The detailed biomechanics 
      of glenohumeral motion were also analyzed in relation to scapulothoracic motion 
      to separately define the contribution of each in global shoulder abduction. 
      RESULTS: The test-retest, intra-examiner and inter-examiner reliabilities of the 
      measurements were assessed. Intra-class correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman 
      plots and repeatability coefficients showed excellent reliability for each 
      parameter. The range of glenohumeral abduction showed high correlation to 
      subtraction of the range of scapulothoracic from the range of global abduction. 
      However, not all negative ranges of glenohumeral abduction meant non-recovery 
      after nerve repair, because scapulothoracic motion contributed in parallel but 
      not uniformly to global shoulder motion. CONCLUSION: The conventional measurement 
      of shoulder global abduction with goniometer is not an appropriate method to 
      analyze the results of suprascapular nerve repair in brachial plexus palsy 
      patients. We recommend examination of glenohumeral and scapulothoracic motions 
      separately with dynamic shoulder radiographic analysis. With scapulothoracic 
      contribution to the global shoulder motion, the glenohumeral motion can be 
      wrongly assessed.

AB  - Assessment of scapulothoracic and glenohumeral contributions to shoulder function 
      during baseball pitching are limited by challenges in accurately measuring 
      dynamic scapular orientation. A recently validated individualized linear model 
      approach that estimates scapular orientation based on measurable humerothoracic 
      orientation has yet to be adapted for pitching and may improve upon currently 
      recommended methods such as the acromion marker cluster (AMC). This study 
      evaluates the ability of a pitching-specific individualized linear model to 
      estimate scapular orientation in static positions throughout a throwing motion by 
      comparing against palpation and an AMC. Individualized linear models were created 
      for 14 collegiate pitchers by determining scapulothoracic and humerothoracic 
      orientations at static arm postures throughout their individual dynamic throwing 
      motions. Linear model and AMC estimates were compared against palpation at 
      intermediate test positions within the throwing motion that were excluded from 
      model creation. Linear model estimates were similar to palpation at all test 
      positions and on all scapulothoracic axes while AMC estimates differed on 
      internal/external rotation and anterior/posterior tilt during cocking (p = 0.001, 
      p = 0.018) and follow-through (p = 0.003, p = 0.006). Linear model root mean 
      square error (RMSE) values were smaller than AMC values for all positions/axes. 
      Linear model RMSE values (2.8-6.3°) were within a range of published values 
      previously deemed acceptable, while AMC values (5.1-15.8°) went beyond this 
      range. The linear model approach accurately estimates static scapular orientation 
      throughout a pitching motion and improves upon current methods. Future 
      applications to dynamic pitching may facilitate understanding of how 
      scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joint function relate to injury risks, 
      rehabilitation, and performance.

TI  - A Modified Kinematic Model of Shoulder Complex Based on Vicon Motion Capturing 
      System: Generalized GH Joint with Floating Centre.
LID - 10.3390/s20133713 [doi]
LID - 3713
AB  - Due to the complex coupling motion of shoulder mechanism, only a small amount of 
      quantitative information is available in the existing literature, although 
      various kinematic models of the shoulder complex have been proposed. This study 
      focused on the specific motion coupling relationship between glenohumeral (GH) 
      joint center displacement variable quantity relative to the thorax coordinate 
      system and humeral elevation angle to describe the shoulder complex. The 
      mechanism model of shoulder complex was proposed with an algorithm designed. 
      Subsequently, twelve healthy subjects performed right arm raising, lowering, as 
      well as raising and lowering (RAL) movements in sixteen elevation planes, and the 
      motion information of the markers attached to the thorax, scapula, and humerus 
      was captured by using Vicon motion capturing system. Then, experimental data was 
      processed and the generalized GH joint with floating center was quantized. 
      Simultaneously, different coupling characteristics were detected during humerus 
      raising as well as lowering movements. The motion coupling relationships in 
      different phases were acquired, and a modified kinematic model was established, 
      with the description of overall motion characteristics of shoulder complex 
      validated by comparing the results with a prior kinematic model from literature, 
      showing enough accuracy for the design of upper limb rehabilitation robots.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and critique the evidence regarding the 
      diagnostic accuracy of physical examination tests for the scapula in patients 
      with shoulder disorders. METHODS: A systematic, computerised literature search of 
      PubMED, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library databases (from database 
      inception through January 2012) using keywords related to diagnostic accuracy of 
      physical examination tests of the scapula. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic 
      Accuracy Studies tool was used to critique the quality of each paper. RESULTS: 
      Eight articles met the inclusion criteria; three were considered to be of high 
      quality. Of the three high-quality studies, two were in reference to a 
      'diagnosis' of shoulder pain. Only one high-quality article referenced specific 
      shoulder pathology of acromioclavicular dislocation with reported sensitivity of 
      71% and 41% for the scapular dyskinesis and SICK scapula test, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Overall, no physical examination test of the scapula was found to be 
      useful in differentially diagnosing pathologies of the shoulder.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Measuring thoracic spine mobility can be of interest to competitive 
      swimmers as it has been associated with shoulder girdle function and scapular 
      position in subjects with and without shoulder pain. At present, no reliability 
      data of thoracic spine mobility measurements are available in the swimming 
      population. This study aims to evaluate the within-session intra- and interrater 
      reliability of the "lumbar-locked rotation test" for thoracic spine rotation in 
      competitive swimmers aged 10 to 18 years. This reliability study is part of a 
      larger prospective cohort study investigating potential risk factors for the 
      development of shoulder pain in competitive swimmers. DESIGN: Within-session, 
      intra- and inter-rater reliability. SETTING: Competitive swimming clubs in 
      Belgium. PARTICIPANTS: 21 competitive swimmers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intra- and 
      inter-rater reliability of the lumbar-locked thoracic rotation test. RESULTS: 
      Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) ranged from 0.91 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.96) 
      to 0.96 (0.89-0.98) for intra-rater reliability. Results for inter-rater 
      reliability ranged from 0.89 (0.72-0.95) to 0.86 (0.65-0.94) respectively for 
      right and left thoracic rotation. CONCLUSION: Results suggest good to excellent 
      reliability of the lumbar-locked thoracic rotation test, indicating this test can 
      be used reliably in clinical practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to introduce levator scapulae (LS) 
      measurement using a caliper and the levator scapulae index (LSI) and to 
      investigate intra- and interrater reliability of the LSI in subjects with and 
      without scapular downward rotation syndrome (SDRS). DESIGN: Two raters measured 
      LS length twice in 38 subjects (19 with SDRS and 19 without SDRS). MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: For reliability testing, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), 
      standard error of measurement (SEM), and minimal detectable change (MDC) were 
      calculated. RESULTS: Intrarater reliability analysis resulted with ICCs ranging 
      from 0.94 to 0.98 in subjects with SDRS and 0.96 to 0.98 in subjects without 
      SDRS. These results represented that intrarater reliability in both groups were 
      excellent for measuring LS length with the LSI. Interrater reliability was good 
      (ICC: 0.82) in subjects with SDRS; however, interrater reliability was moderate 
      (ICC: 0.75) in subjects without SDRS. Additionally, SEM and MDC were 0.13% and 
      0.36% in subjects with SDRS and 0.35% and 0.97% in subjects without SDRS. In 
      subjects with SDRS, low dispersion of the measurement errors and MDC were shown. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that the LSI is a reliable method to measure LS 
      length and is more reliable for subjects with SDRS.

AB  - A thorough physical examination of the shoulder and cervical spine is critical in 
      establishing a focused differential diagnosis of the pathology in and around the 
      shoulder joint. Numerous tests have been described in the literature to help 
      improve the diagnostic accuracy of specific shoulder or cervical spine pathology. 
      A comprehensive approach for the physical examination of the cervical spine, 
      scapula, and rotator cuff is presented and descriptions on how the tests are 
      performed and the evidence behind why specific tests are used in enabling 
      improved diagnosis of shoulder pathology are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although it is thought that there is a relationship between neck pain 
      and scapular dysfunction, there are controversial results and no clear 
      information in the literature regarding this issue. This study aimed to 
      investigate the alterations in the 3-Dimensional scapular orientation on patients 
      with non-specific neck pain. METHOD: Thirty-four patients with chronic 
      non-specific neck pain [age, 29.1 (5) years; height, 165.3 (6.1) centimeters; 
      weight, 62.1 (9.6) kilogram] and 29 healthy controls [age, 28.2 (3.3) years; 
      height, 166.8 (8.1) centimeters; weight, 60.9 (8.5) kilogram] were included in 
      the study. 3-Dimensional scapular kinematics were obtained during arm elevation 
      and lowering trials in the sagittal, scapular, and frontal planes. FINDINGS: 
      Compared to healthy controls, the patients with neck pain demonstrated 
      significantly reduced upward scapular rotation on both the dominant and 
      non-dominant sides in all three planes. Patients with neck pain had increased 
      internal rotation in the sagittal and frontal planes on the dominant side and 
      increased external rotation in the frontal plane on the non-dominant side. No 
      difference was observed between groups considering posterior scapular tilt. 
      INTERPRETATION: There are alterations in the 3-Dimensional scapular orientations 
      in patients with chronic non-specific neck pain compared to healthy controls. 
      Therefore, the scapular control may also be examined in patients with neck pain 
      and it can be included in the rehabilitation program if needed.

TI  - Offset in Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty: Where, When, and How Much.
PG  - 89-99
LID - 10.5435/JAAOS-D-20-00671 [doi]
AB  - Since the advent of Paul Grammont medialized reverse shoulder prosthesis in the 
      1980s, shoulder surgeons have had a reliable option for treating glenohumeral 
      joint disease in the rotator cuff-deficient shoulder. However, the prosthesis is 
      not without complications, including scapular notching, instability, and limited 
      rotational motion. Implants have been modified from the original design in an 
      effort to reduce the risk of these complications. Increasing the offset, or 
      lateralization, of the glenosphere may reduce the rate of scapular notching, 
      reduce impingement, increase stability, and improve rotational motion. However, a 
      more lateralized glenosphere could lead to baseplate loosening, decreased deltoid 
      efficiency, and increased risk of acromial fracture. Increasing the offset on the 
      humeral side, rather than the glenosphere side, may be able to reduce the rate of 
      scapular notching and improve rotational motion without an increased risk of 
      baseplate loosening. Humeral lateralization also improves tension of the rotator 
      cuff and maintains good deltoid efficiency. However, humeral lateralization 
      provides little stability benefit, and acromial fracture remains a risk. 
      Ultimately, the surgeon must be familiar with the implants he or she is using and 
      the options for both glenosphere and humeral lateralization to ensure that risks 
      and benefits can be weighed for each patient.

TI  - Intra-protocol repeatability and inter-protocol agreement for the analysis of 
      scapulo-humeral coordination.
PG  - 271-82
LID - 10.1007/s11517-013-1121-y [doi]
AB  - Multi-center clinical trials incorporating shoulder kinematics are currently 
      uncommon. The absence of repeatability and limits of agreement (LoA) studies 
      between different centers employing different motion analysis protocols has led 
      to a lack dataset compatibility. Therefore, the aim of this work was to determine 
      the repeatability and LoA between two shoulder kinematic protocols. The first one 
      uses a scapula tracker (ST), the International Society of Biomechanics anatomical 
      frames and an optoelectronic measurement system, and the second uses a spine 
      tracker, the INAIL Shoulder and Elbow Outpatient protocol (ISEO) and an inertial 
      and magnetic measurement system. First within-protocol repeatability for each 
      approach was assessed on a group of 23 healthy subjects and compared with the 
      literature. Then, the between-protocol agreement was evaluated. The 
      within-protocol repeatability was similar for the ST ([Formula: see text] = 
      2.35°, [Formula: see text] = 0.97°, SEM = 2.5°) and ISEO ([Formula: see text] = 
      2.24°, [Formula: see text] = 0.97°, SEM = 2.3°) protocols and comparable with 
      data from published literature. The between-protocol agreement analysis showed 
      comparable scapula medio-lateral rotation measurements for up to 120° of 
      flexion-extension and up to 100° of scapula plane ab-adduction. Scapula 
      protraction-retraction measurements were in agreement for a smaller range of 
      humeral elevation. The results of this study suggest comparable repeatability for 
      the ST and ISEO protocols and between-protocol agreement for two scapula 
      rotations. Different thresholds for repeatability and LoA may be adapted to suit 
      different clinical hypotheses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The limits of the glenoid track have been defined through methods 
      that do not take properly into account the physiological articular forces 
      involved in the articular contact, which may interfere with its size. Finite 
      elements numerical models can simulate joint forces more realistically. 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the glenoid track in a finite element numerical model of 
      the shoulder. METHODS: We developed a finite element numerical model of the 
      shoulder, based on imaging exams of a volunteer, including the proximal humerus, 
      scapula, their respective articular cartilages, and the rotator cuff muscles. An 
      algorithm to balance the weight of the arm calculated muscle, wrapping, and 
      articular reaction forces. The model has freedom of translation in three axes. 
      The articular contact characteristics and glenoid track's dimensions according to 
      the literature references were evaluated in 60°, 90° and 120° of abduction, all 
      at the 90° external rotation. RESULTS: The model's anatomy and physiology were 
      validated. The value of the glenoid track (according to Yamamoto's parameters) 
      was 86% of glenoid length at 90° abduction before loading of forces, and 79% 
      afterwards. The glenoid track at 60°, 90° and 120° of abduction (Omori's 
      parameters) corresponded, respectively, to 71%, 88% and 104% of glenoid length 
      before loading of forces, and 76%, 84% and 103% afterward. CONCLUSION: The 
      numerical model is suitable for the shoulder articular contact evaluation. The 
      articular contact analysis ratifies the glenoid track concept and contributes to 
      its evolution. This value is influenced by glenohumeral joint forces, which 
      should be considered for the analysis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Basic Science Study; 
      Computer Modelling.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is a lack of understanding of the impact of generalized joint 
      mobility, joint hypermobility, and resting scapular position on neurodynamic 
      testing of the median nerve. The objectives of the study were to determine: 1) 
      the reliability of the Beighton score (BS) with and without the cutoff score for 
      general joint hypermobility (GJH); 2) if there are differences in the Median 
      Neurodynamic Test 1 (MNT 1) based on the Beighton cutoff score for GJH; 3) if 
      there are differences in the MNT 1 based on an assessment of resting scapular 
      position; 4) if there are relationships between the BS with and without the 
      cutoff score for GJH, resting scapular position, and MNT 1. METHODS: Testing was 
      performed by two testers at two-time intervals at least 1 week apart. The 
      population of interest was healthy asymptomatic adults. The outcome measures 
      included the BS, resting scapular position, and MNT 1. RESULTS: Intraclass 
      correlation coefficients (ICC(2,1)) were 0.52 for intertester reliability at 
      visit 1 and 0.86 at visit 2, with intratester reliability of 0.88 for Tester 1 
      and 0.71 for Tester 2 for the BS. Intertester prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted 
      kappa (PABAK) values for the Beighton GJH cutoff scores were 0.80-0.84 and 0.80 
      to 0.92 for intratester reliability. There were no statistically significant 
      differences or relationships for any of the other variables of interest. 
      CONCLUSION: Joint mobility and resting scapular position are not confounding 
      variables when performing MNT 1 in an asymptomatic population.

AB  - The implementation of global positioning systems (GPSs) has become widely 
      supported in a variety of sports, owing to the insight it provides into athlete 
      workloads, training parameters, and playing styles. Despite widely reported use 
      of GPS in equine settings, few studies have quantified the reliability of 
      spatiotemporal characteristics in a dynamic environment of high-intensity 
      gameplay. Owing to the unique game demands of Polo for both riders and horses, 
      this study aimed to assess the interunit reliability between a traditional GPS 
      placement between the shoulder blades and a Polo-specific placement on players' 
      belts, to inform the feasibility of GPS implementation within Polo. GPS data were 
      collected across 37 unique rider-horse interactions. GPS metrics included 
      distance covered, speeds attained, and number of sprints performed. Data were 
      further categorized with respect to equine-specific speed zones. All metrics 
      agreed across multiple reliability measures and were deemed qualitatively 
      reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.70 and coefficient of variation 
      < 10%), with sprint count displaying 100% agreement between units. Findings 
      suggest the spatiotemporal characteristics of Polo can be reliably measured via 
      GPS through a traditional or belt-based placement, which leaves the decision of 
      GPS placement at riders' discretion.

AB  - Knowledge of three-dimensional scapular movements is essential to understand 
      post-stroke shoulder pain. The goal of the present work is to determine the 
      feasibility and the within and between session reliability of a movement protocol 
      for three-dimensional scapular movement analysis in stroke patients with mild to 
      moderate impairment, using an optoelectronic measurement system. Scapular 
      kinematics of 10 stroke patients and 10 healthy controls was recorded on two 
      occasions during active anteflexion and abduction from 0° to 60° and from 0° to 
      120°. All tasks were executed unilaterally and bilaterally. The protocol's 
      feasibility was first assessed, followed by within and between session 
      reliability of scapular total range of motion (ROM), joint angles at start 
      position and of angular waveforms. Additionally, measurement errors were 
      calculated for all parameters. Results indicated that the protocol was generally 
      feasible for this group of patients and assessors. Within session reliability was 
      very good for all tasks. Between sessions, scapular angles at start position were 
      measured reliably for most tasks, while scapular ROM was more reliable during the 
      120° tasks. In general, scapular angles showed higher reliability during 
      anteflexion compared to abduction, especially for protraction. Scapular lateral 
      rotations resulted in smallest measurement errors. This study indicates that 
      scapular kinematics can be measured reliably and with precision within one 
      measurement session. In case of multiple test sessions, further methodological 
      optimization is required for this protocol to be suitable for clinical 
      decision-making and evaluation of treatment efficacy.

TI  - Reliability and Validity of a Clinical Assessment Tool for Measuring Scapular 
      Motion in All 3 Anatomical Planes.
PG  - 586-593
LID - 10.4085/276-20 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: A single clinical assessment device that can be used to objectively 
      measure scapular motion in each anatomical plane is not currently available. The 
      development of a novel electric goniometer would allow scapular motion in all 3 
      anatomical planes to be quantified. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reliability and 
      validity of an electric goniometer for measuring scapular motion in each 
      anatomical plane during upper extremity elevation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. 
      SETTING: Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Sixty participants (29 
      women, 31 men; age = 30 ± 14 years, height = 1.73 ± 0.10 m, mass = 75.32 ± 16.90 
      kg) recruited from the general population. INTERVENTION(S): An electric 
      goniometer was used to record clinical measurements of scapular position at rest 
      and total arc of motion (excursion) during active upper extremity elevation in 2 
      testing sessions separated by several days. Measurements were recorded 
      independently by 2 examiners. In 1 session, scapular motion was recorded 
      simultaneously using a 14-camera, 3-dimensional optical motion-capture system. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Reliability analysis included examination of clinical 
      measurements for scapular position at rest and excursion during each condition. 
      Both the intrarater reliability between testing sessions and the interrater 
      reliability recorded in the same session were assessed using intraclass 
      correlation coefficients (ICCs [2,3]). The criterion validity was examined by 
      comparing the mean excursion values of each condition recorded using the electric 
      goniometer and the 3-dimensional optical motion-capture system. Validity was 
      assessed by evaluating the average difference and root mean square error. 
      RESULTS: The between-sessions intrarater reliability was moderate to good (ICC 
      [2,3] range = 0.628-0.874). The within-session interrater reliability was 
      moderate to excellent (ICC [2,3] range = 0.545-0.912). The average difference 
      between total excursion values recorded using the electric goniometer and the 
      3-dimensional optical motion-capture system ranged from -7° to 4°, and the root 
      mean square error ranged from 7° to 10°. CONCLUSIONS: The reliability of scapular 
      measurements was best when a standard operating procedure was used. The electric 
      goniometer provided an accurate measurement of scapular excursions in all 3 
      anatomical planes during upper extremity elevation.

      complication.
PG  - 1075-82
LID - 10.1007/s00264-010-1125-2 [doi]
AB  - Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) has been reported to be associated 
      with a complication rate that is four times that of conventional total shoulder 
      arthroplasty. It is the purpose of this article to identify and understand the 
      most common and most serious complications of RTSA and to review current methods 
      of prevention and treatment. The current literature was reviewed to identify type 
      and prevalence of reported complications and to identify risk factors, preventive 
      measures as well as technical details for management strategies for complications 
      of RTSA. The variable accuracy of reporting and the heterogeneity of methodology 
      in the literature limited our study, however, a definitive ranking of most to 
      least common complication emerged. The currently identified most common 
      complication is scapular notching. The clinically most relevant complications are 
      infection, instability and acromial fractures. Haematoma formation used to be 
      very frequent but can be controlled, glenoid component loosening, however, is 
      rare when compared with conventional total shoulder replacement. In conclusion, 
      RTSA is associated with a high rate of complications. Their incidence and the 
      results of their treatment are inconsistently reported. To document and then 
      prevent complications, a standardised monitoring tool including clear definitions 
      and assessment instructions appears necessary.

AB  - Alterations in scapular muscle activity, including excess activation of the upper 
      trapezius (UT) and onset latencies of the lower trapezius (LT) and serratus 
      anterior (SA) muscles, are associated with abnormal scapular motion and shoulder 
      impingement. Limited information exists on the reliability of neuromuscular 
      activity to demonstrate the efficacy of interventions. The purpose of this study 
      was to characterize the reproducibility of scapular muscle activity (mean 
      activity, relative onset timing) over time and establish the minimal detectable 
      change (MDC). Surface electromyography (sEMG) of the UT, LT, SA and anterior 
      deltoid (AD) muscles in 16 adults were captured during an overhead lifting task 
      in two sessions, one-week apart. sEMG data were also normalized to maximum 
      isometric contraction and the relative onset and mean muscle activity during 
      concentric and eccentric phases of the scapular muscles were calculated. 
      Additionally, reliability of the absolute sEMG data during the lifting task and 
      MVIC was evaluated. Both intrasession and intersession reliability of normalized 
      and absolute mean scapular muscle activity, assessed with intraclass correlation 
      coefficients (ICC), ranged from 0.62 to 0.99; MDC values were between 1.3% and 
      11.7% MVIC and 24 to 135 mV absolute sEMG. Reliability of sEMG during MVIC was 
      ICC = 0.82-0.99, with the exception of intersession upper trapezius reliability 
      (ICC = 0.36). Within session reliability of muscle onset times was ICC = 
      0.88-0.97, but between session reliability was lower with ICC = 0.43-0.73; MDC 
      were between 39 and 237 ms. Small changes in scapular neuromuscular mean activity 
      (>11.7% MVIC) can be interpreted as meaningful change, while change in muscle 
      onset timing in light of specific processing parameters used in this study is 
      more variable.

TI  - Radiological and biomechanical assessment of displaced greater tuberosity 
      fractures.
PG  - 1479-1486
LID - 10.1007/s00264-018-4170-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Greater tuberosity fractures are challenging lesions concerning 
      decision-making. In order to improve our treatment algorithm, we developed a new 
      method, which allows predicting a possible subacromial conflict on standard 
      anteroposterior radiographs, considering not only the displacement of the 
      fragment but also the width of the subacromial space. METHODS: The measurement 
      technique consisted of drawing three concentric circles on true anteroposterior 
      radiographs. The inner circle (radius Rh) perfectly matched the humeral head 
      surface. The medial circle (radius Rt) was tangent to the greater tuberosity, and 
      the outer circle (radius Ra) touched the undersurface of the acromion. The ratio 
      Rt/Rh, which describes how much the greater tuberosity projects above the 
      articular surface, and the relationship (Rt-Rh)/(Ra-Rh), which quantifies the 
      space occupied by the greater tuberosity under the acromion, were calculated and 
      called Greater Tuberosity Index and Impingement Index, respectively. Five dry 
      humeri were used to assess the influence of rotation and abduction on the Greater 
      Tuberosity Index. The radiographs of 80 shoulders without any osseous pathology 
      were analyzed to obtain reference values for both indices. Finally, greater 
      tuberosity fractures with different displacements were created in five cadaver 
      specimens, and subacromial impingement was correlated with these parameters. 
      RESULTS: On anteroposterior radiographs, the greater tuberosity was most 
      prominent in neutral rotation, regardless of abduction. In shoulders without 
      osseous pathology, the Greater Tuberosity Index and the Impingement Index 
      averaged 1.15 (range 1.06-1.28) and 0.46 (range 0.21-0.67). In the biomechanical 
      experiments, the Impingement Index was a better discriminator for subacromial 
      impingement than the Greater Tuberosity Index. A fracture with a displacement 
      corresponding to an Impingement Index of 0.71 or greater was associated with 
      subacromial impingement. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of a displaced greater tuberosity 
      fragment should be considered if the Impingement Index is 0.7 or greater. The 
      measurement method is simple and reliable and has the potential to be used for 
      the assessment of subacromial impingement in other conditions.

AB  - The goal of this study was to develop and validate a non-invasive approach to 
      estimate scapular kinematics in individual patients. We hypothesized that machine 
      learning algorithms could be developed using motion capture data to accurately 
      estimate dynamic scapula orientation based on measured humeral orientations and 
      acromion process positions. The accuracy of the algorithms was evaluated against 
      a gold standard of biplane fluoroscopy using a 2D to 3D fluoroscopy/model 
      matching process. Individualized neural networks were developed for nine healthy 
      adult shoulders. These models were used to predict scapulothoracic kinematics, 
      and the predicted kinematics were compared to kinematics obtained using biplane 
      fluoroscopy to determine the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. Results 
      showed correlations between predicted kinematics and validation kinematics. 
      Estimated kinematics were within 10 of validation kinematics. We concluded that 
      individualized machine learning algorithms show promise for providing accurate, 
      non-invasive measurements of scapulothoracic kinematics.

TI  - Development and validation of a model for quantifying glenohumeral ligament 
      strains during function.
PG  - 461-8
AB  - Analysis of the function of glenohumeral ligaments (GHLs) during physical joint 
      manipulations is hindered by an inability to adequately image these tissues 
      during the movements. This restricts functional biomechanics studies only to the 
      manoeuvres that may be replicated cadaverically. There is, however, a clinical 
      imperative to be able to investigate complex manoeuvres that exacerbate symptoms 
      but cannot be easily conducted physically in the laboratory. The aim of this 
      study was to develop and validate an algorithm for a computer simulation model 
      that allows the quantification of glenohumeral ligament lengths during function. 
      Datasets of the humerus and scapula pair were segmented to provide individual 
      surface meshes of the bones and insertion points of each glenohumeral ligament on 
      both bones. An algorithm was developed in which the glenohumeral ligament 
      attachment-to-attachment length was divided into two straight lines, plus an arc 
      overlaying the spherical wrapping portions. The model was validated by simulating 
      two classical cadaveric studies from the literature and comparing results. 
      Predictions from the model were qualitatively similar to the results of the two 
      cadaveric studies by a factor of 91.7% and 81.8%, respectively. Algorithm 
      application will allow investigation of functional loading of the glenohumeral 
      ligaments during simulated complex motions. This could then be used to provide 
      diagnostic understanding and thus, inform surgical reconstruction.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, blinded interrater reliability study. OBJECTIVE: To 
      determine the interrater reliability of the modified Scapular Assistance Test 
      (mSAT) with and without the use of additional handheld weights. METHODS: 110 
      Shoulder patients with various shoulder pathologies were consecutively recruited. 
      Tests were performed independently and randomly on each participant by 2 
      different examiners, which were blinded to further clinical information (e.g. 
      patient history, former diagnostic results). Percent agreement, Cohen's kappa 
      (Κ), proportion of positive/negative agreement, maximum Κ, prevalence and bias 
      indexes and prevalence-adjusted-bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) were calculated as 
      estimates of interrater reliability of the mSAT with and without additional 
      handheld weights. Weights were chosen according to body weight. RESULTS: The 
      reliability measures for the mSAT (Cohen's Κ: 0.68, confidence interval (CI): 
      0.51-0.85; PABAK: 0.78, CI: 0.67-0.90) as well as for the mSAT with handheld 
      weights (Cohen's Κ: 0.63, CI: 0.44-0.81; PABAK: 0.76, CI: 0.64-0.88) showed 
      substantial agreement according to the classification system proposed by Landis 
      and Koch. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, the mSAT with and 
      without additional weights can be considered as reliable for clinical use. Since 
      both tests showed substantial agreement, the use of additional handheld weights 
      might not be necessary in case of obvious scapula dyskinesis. However, to perform 
      the mSAT with/without additional weights should depend not only on its 
      reliability values. Name of the public trials registry and the registration 
      number: German Clinical Trials Register, protocol number DRKS00005377.

AB  - PURPOSE: To detect differences between the values of dynamic coracohumeral 
      distance (CHD) measured using ultrasonography (USG) in different shoulder 
      rotations and to investigate its correlation with subscapularis tear. METHODS: We 
      prospectively enrolled consecutive patients (n = 168) who were scheduled to have 
      arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Patients with a history of previous shoulder 
      surgery or shoulder fracture and patients with external rotation less than 30° 
      were excluded from the study. Dynamic CHD was measured using USG in 3 different 
      shoulder positions: external rotation, neutral and internal rotation. We 
      evaluated the intrarater reliability with 3 times repetition of measurement. 
      Patients were divided into 1 of 3 groups according to arthroscopic findings: 
      intact subscapularis, partial-thickness tear, and full-thickness tear of the 
      subscapularis. The control group (n = 23) included patients without rotator cuff 
      tears from the outpatient clinic. Subgroup analysis-according to the presence of 
      dynamic subcoracoid stenosis, defined as a CHD less than 6 mm measured in 
      internal rotation-was performed to find the clinical effect of dynamic 
      subcoracoid stenosis. RESULTS: A partial-thickness tear of the subscapularis 
      tendon was present in 60 patients (35.7%) and a full-thickness tear in 26 
      patients (15.4%) among 168 patients. The CHD was maximum in external rotation and 
      the narrowest in internal rotation. There were no statistical differences in the 
      CHDs between groups with different subscapularis tear status. According to the 
      presence of dynamic subcoracoid stenosis, patients with dynamic subcoracoid 
      stenosis had a significantly higher incidence of partial-thickness subscapularis 
      tear than those without stenosis (P = .022). CONCLUSIONS: The CHD values were 
      narrowest in shoulder internal rotation, which is thought to be the pathogenic 
      position. We could not confirm the correlation between CHD and subscapularis 
      tear. However, patients who have dynamic subcoracoid stenosis had significantly 
      higher incidence of subscapularis tear than others without dynamic stenosis. 
      LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prospective prognostic cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Structural bone graft for reconstruction of glenoid bone stock is 
      often necessary in the setting of revision shoulder arthroplasty. This study 
      introduces a new structural autograft technique using the distal clavicle for 
      treatment of glenoid bone loss in the setting of revision shoulder arthroplasty. 
      METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-surgeon study of patients with 
      significant glenoid bone loss requiring revision shoulder arthroplasty with 
      autologous distal clavicle bone grafting to the glenoid. Twenty patients with 
      failed shoulder arthroplasty who underwent revisions of their glenoid components 
      between 2015 and 2019 were retrospectively identified. Sixteen patients were 
      available with follow-up of greater than 1 year. Patient records and radiographs 
      were reviewed for intraoperative and postoperative complications. Preoperative 
      and postoperative function were evaluated by physical examination and 
      patient-reported outcome surveys. RESULTS: There were no observed intraoperative 
      complications relating to the distal clavicle autograft harvest or placement. 
      There were no iatrogenic nerve injuries or intraoperative instability. One of the 
      16 patients developed postoperative loosening and subsequent failure of the 
      glenoid baseplate, requiring revision. One additional patient demonstrated 
      increased elevation of the coracoclavicular interval postoperatively, likely 
      related to the distal clavicle autograft harvest. At a mean follow-up of 25 
      months, 15 of 16 glenoid implants remained well fixed (93.4%), with no evidence 
      of infection, or impingement demonstrated radiographically or clinically. Average 
      patient age was 69 years at the time of surgery. Forward elevation improved from 
      76° to 123° at final follow-up (P = .0002). The American Shoulder and Elbow 
      Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form score improved from an average of 
      35.8 to 67.8 at mean follow-up (P = .001). The visual analog scale score improved 
      from an average of 5.9 to 2 at mean follow-up, though not statistically 
      significant (P = .068). There was no significant change in external rotation 
      following surgery (P = .319). CONCLUSION: Osteolysis and bone loss of the glenoid 
      poses a challenging problem in revision shoulder arthroplasty. Distal clavicle 
      autograft augmentation is a viable and reproducible technique to manage 
      structural glenoid defects.

TI  - New Tracking System of Human Scapula Using Ultrasonography and Motion Sensors: A 
      Descriptive Test-Retest Design.
LID - jsr.2018-0305 [pii]
LID - 10.1123/jsr.2018-0305 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Several studies have shown that the kinematics of the scapula is altered 
      in many disorders that affect the shoulder. Description of scapular motion in the 
      chest continues to be a scientific and clinical challenge. OBJECTIVE: To check 
      the validity and reliability of a new, minimally invasive method of tracking the 
      internal and external rotation of the scapula using ultrasound imaging combined 
      with the signal provided by a 3-dimensional electromagnetic sensor. DESIGN: A 
      cross-sectional study with a repeated-measures descriptive test-retest design was 
      employed to evaluate this new tracking method. The new method was validated in 
      vitro and the reliability of data over repeated measures between scapula 
      positions was calculated in vivo. SETTING: University laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: A 
      total of 30 healthy men and women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The validation of the 
      scapula rotation tracking using the in vitro model was calculated by Pearson 
      correlation test between a 2-dimensional cross-correlation algorithm of the new 
      method and another software image. The reliability of the tracking of the scapula 
      rotation was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: In 
      the validation in vitro, the correlation of rotations obtained by the 2 methods 
      was good (r = .77, P = .01). The reliability in vivo had excellent results 
      (intraclass correlation coefficient = .88; 95% confidence interval, .82-.93) in 
      the test-retest analysis of 8 measures. The intrarater analysis of variance test 
      showed no significant differences between the measures (P = .85, F = 0.46). 
      CONCLUSION: Ultrasound imaging combined with a motion sensor to track the scapula 
      has been shown to be a reliable and valid method for measuring internal and 
      external rotation during separation of the upper limb.

TI  - Reliability and precision of 3D wireless measurement of scapular kinematics.
PG  - 921-931
LID - 10.1007/s11517-014-1186-2 [doi]
AB  - To direct interventions aimed at improving scapular position and motion in 
      shoulder pathologies, a clinically feasible, objective, sensitive and reliable 
      assessment of scapular dyskinesis is needed. The aim of this study is to evaluate 
      the intra- and inter-observer reliability and the precision of 3D scapula 
      kinematics measurement using wireless sensors of an inertial and magnetic 
      measurement system (IMMS). Scapular kinematics during humerus anteflexion and 
      abduction of 20 subjects without shoulder pathologies were measured twice by two 
      observers at two different days, using IMMS. Similar movement patterns and 
      corresponding high intraclass correlation coefficients were found within (intra) 
      and between (inter) observers, especially for scapular retraction/protraction 
      (0.65-0.85) and medio/lateral rotation (0.56-0.91). Lowest reliability and 
      highest difference in range of motion were observed for anterior/posterior tilt. 
      Medio/lateral rotation and anterior/posterior tilt showed a high precision, with 
      standard error of measurement being mostly below 5°. The inter-observer 
      measurements of retraction/protraction showed lowest precision, reflected in 
      systematic differences. This is caused by an offset in anatomical calibration of 
      the sensors. IMMS enables easy and objective measurement of 3D scapula 
      kinematics. Further research in a patient population should focus on clinical 
      feasibility and validity for measurement of scapular dyskinesis. This would 
      include the application of a scapula locator to enhance anatomical calibration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Shoulder pain is the most common complaint for wheelchair athletes. 
      Scapular orientation and dyskinesia are thought to be associated with shoulder 
      pathology, yet no previous studies have examined the bilateral scapula kinematics 
      of wheelchair athletes during propulsion. RESEARCH QUESTION: To examine bilateral 
      scapular kinematics of highly trained wheelchair rugby (WR) players and any 
      associations with self-reported shoulder pain during everyday wheelchair 
      propulsion. METHODS: Ten WR players (5 with shoulder pain, 5 without) performed 
      2 × 3-minute bouts of exercise in their everyday wheelchair on a wheelchair 
      ergometer at two sub-maximal speeds (3 and 6 km h(-1)). During the final minute, 
      3D kinematic data were collected at 100 Hz to describe scapulothoracic motion 
      relative to each propulsion cycle. Instantaneous asymmetries in scapular 
      orientation between dominant and non-dominant sides were also reported. 
      Differences in scapular kinematics and propulsion asymmetries were compared 
      across shoulders symptomatic and asymptomatic of pain. RESULTS: An internally 
      rotated, upwardly rotated and anteriorly tilted scapula was common during 
      wheelchair propulsion and asymmetries ≤14° did exist, yet minimal changes were 
      observed across speeds. Participants with bilateral shoulder pain displayed a 
      less upwardly rotated scapula during propulsion, however large inter-individual 
      variability in scapular kinematics was noted. SIGNIFICANCE: Scapular asymmetries 
      are exhibited by wheelchair athletes during wheelchair propulsion, yet these were 
      not exacerbated by increased speed and had limited associations to shoulder pain. 
      This suggests that propulsion kinematics of highly trained athletes may not be 
      the primary cause of pain experienced by this population.

AB  - Study Design Cross-sectional. Background The scapular dyskinesis test (SDT) has 
      demonstrated reliability and validity, but its utility for clinical decision 
      making is unclear. Objectives To characterize the prevalence of scapular 
      dyskinesis in participants with and without shoulder pain, and to determine the 
      influence of blinding to the presence of shoulder pain on prevalence of scapular 
      dyskinesis. Methods Participants (n = 135), 67 with shoulder pain and 68 healthy 
      controls, were included in this study. The SDT was performed by 2 examiners, from 
      a total of 21 physical therapists. The second examiner was blinded to the 
      participant's presence of shoulder pain. The SDT involved participants performing 
      5 repetitions of shoulder flexion and abduction, while the clinician observed for 
      scapular dyskinesis, as characterized by scapular winging or dysrhythmia. 
      Dyskinesis was rated as normal, subtle, or obvious. Ratings were collapsed into 2 
      groups, dyskinesis (subtle and obvious) and no dyskinesis (normal), as 
      recommended by expert consensus. Results There were no significant differences 
      for scapular dyskinesis prevalence between the shoulder pain group and control 
      group during the SDT in abduction (shoulder pain, 67.2%; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: 0.55, 0.77 and control group, 52.9%; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.64; P = .09) or 
      flexion (shoulder pain, 67.2%; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.77 and control group, 61.8%; 95% 
      CI: 0.50, 0.72; P = .51). There were significant differences (P ≤001) between the 
      examiners' SDT ratings in the shoulder pain group. The unblinded examiner 
      reported a higher prevalence when testing the involved shoulder for dyskinesis in 
      flexion (blinded, 67.7%; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.78 and unblinded, 80%; 95% CI: 0.69, 
      0.88) and during abduction (blinded, 66.2%; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.76 and unblinded, 
      78.5%; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.87). Conclusion Scapular dyskinesis as assessed with the 
      SDT is not more prevalent in those with shoulder pain. Rating was influenced by 
      an examiner's knowledge of shoulder pain presence. Scapular dyskinesis may 
      represent normal movement variability. Level of Evidence Diagnosis, level 4. J

TI  - Validation of Shoulder Response of Human Body Finite-Element Model (GHBMC) Under 
      Whole Body Lateral Impact Condition.
PG  - 2558-2576
LID - 10.1007/s10439-015-1546-6 [doi]
AB  - In previous shoulder impact studies, the 50th-percentile male GHBMC human body 
      finite-element model was shown to have good biofidelity regarding impact force, 
      but under-predicted shoulder deflection by 80% compared to those observed in the 
      experiment. The goal of this study was to validate the response of the GHBMC M50 
      model by focusing on three-dimensional shoulder kinematics under a whole-body 
      lateral impact condition. Five modifications, focused on material properties and 
      modeling techniques, were introduced into the model and a supplementary 
      sensitivity analysis was done to determine the influence of each modification to 
      the biomechanical response of the body. The modified model predicted 
      substantially improved shoulder response and peak shoulder deflection within 10% 
      of the observed experimental data, and showed good correlation in the scapula 
      kinematics on sagittal and transverse planes. The improvement in the biofidelity 
      of the shoulder region was mainly due to the modifications of material properties 
      of muscle, the acromioclavicular joint, and the attachment region between the 
      pectoralis major and ribs. Predictions of rib fracture and chest deflection were 
      also improved because of these modifications.

AB  - Posterior glenohumeral instability remains a difficult problem. There are still 
      many controversies regarding surgical treatment, due to a lack of understanding 
      the pathomechanical issues leading to posterior instability. This article 
      presents a new arthroscopic technique of posterior bone block augmentation, which 
      we found to be effective, repeatable and successful. This technique can be used 
      for combined soft tissue and bony defects as well as for revisions after previous 
      soft tissue reconstructions.

TI  - Validation of a video-based motion analysis technique in 3-D dynamic scapular 
      kinematic measurements.
PG  - 2462-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2012.06.025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current non-invasive 3-D scapular kinematic measurement techniques 
      such as electromagnetic tracking are subjected to restrictions of wired sensors 
      and limited capture space. Video-based motion analysis provides greater freedom 
      with relatively less movement restriction. However, video-based motion analysis 
      was rarely used in and not validated for scapular kinematics. METHODS: Scapular 
      kinematics of five subjects performing abduction, scaption, and internal/external 
      rotation was captured simultaneously with video-based motion analysis and dynamic 
      stereo X-ray, a gold standard for tracking scapular movements. The data from 
      video-based motion analysis was correlated with the data from dynamic stereo 
      X-ray for validity evaluation. FINDINGS: Strong and significant correlations were 
      identified in scapular protraction/retraction and medial/lateral rotation during 
      abduction and scaption, and scapular medial/lateral rotation and 
      anterior/posterior tilt during internal/external rotation. INTERPRETATION: 
      Video-based motion analysis is valid for evaluating a single subject's scapular 
      movement pattern in protraction/retraction during abduction and scaption, and 
      medial/lateral-rotation during internal/external rotation. 
      Anterior/posterior-tilt during abduction and scaption should be investigated with 
      caution. Video motion analysis is also valid for evaluating group average of 
      scapular kinematics except for protraction/retraction during internal/external 
      rotation. While acknowledging the inherent limitations, video-based motion 
      analysis is an appropriate technique for tracking scapular kinematics.

TI  - Anatomical principles for minimally invasive reconstruction of the 
      acromioclavicular joint with anchors.
PG  - 2317-2324
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of a minimally 
      invasive surgical technique for the treatment of patients with acromioclavicular 
      joint dislocation. METHODS: Sixteen patients with complete acromioclavicular 
      joint dislocation were enrolled in this study. All patients were asked to follow 
      the less active rehabilitation protocol post-operatively. Computed tomography 
      with 3-D reconstruction of the injured shoulder was performed on each patient 
      post operatively for the assessment of the accuracy of the suture anchor 
      placement in the coracoid process and the reduction of the acromioclavicular 
      joint. Radiographs of Zanca view and axillary view of both shoulders were taken 
      for evaluating the maintenance of the acromioclavicular joint reduction at each 
      follow-up visit. The Constant shoulder score was used for function assessment at 
      the final follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty seven of the 32 anchors implanted in the 
      coracoid process met the criteria of good position. One patient developed 
      complete loss of reduction and another had partial loss of reduction in the 
      anteroposterior plane. For the other 14 patients, the mean Constant score was 90 
      (range, 82-95). For the patients with partial and complete loss of reduction, the 
      Constant score were 92 and 76 respectively. All of them got nearly normal range 
      of motion of the shoulders and restored to pre-operative life and works. 
      CONCLUSION: With this minimally invasive approach and limited exposure of the 
      coracoid, a surgeon can place the suture anchors at the anatomical insertions of 
      the coracoclavicular ligament and allow the dislocated joint reduced and 
      maintained well. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, Case series; therapeutic study.

      foci.
PG  - 1041-57
LID - 10.1177/0954411913492303 [doi]
AB  - Musculoskeletal shoulder models allow non-invasive prediction of parameters that 
      cannot be measured, particularly the loading applied to morphological structures 
      and neurological control. This insight improves treatment and avoidance of 
      pathology and performance evaluation and optimisation. A lack of appropriate 
      validation and knowledge of model parameters' accuracy may cause reduced clinical 
      success for these models. Instrumented implants have recently been used to 
      validate musculoskeletal models, adding important information to the literature. 
      This development along with increasing prevalence of shoulder models necessitates 
      a fresh review of available models and their utility. The practical uses of 
      models are described. Accuracy of model inputs, modelling techniques and model 
      sensitivity is the main technical review undertaken. Collection and comparison of 
      these parameters are vital to understanding disagreement between model outputs. 
      Trends in shoulder modelling are highlighted: validation through instrumented 
      prostheses, increasing openness and strictly constrained, optimised, measured 
      kinematics. Future directions are recommended: validation through focus on model 
      sub-sections, increased subject specificity with imaging techniques determining 
      muscle and body segment parameters and through different scaling and kinematics 
      optimisation approaches.

TI  - Robustness and reproducibility of a glenoid-centered scapular coordinate system 
      derived from low-dose stereoradiography analysis.
PG  - 56-61
LID - 10.1123/jab.2013-0310 [doi]
AB  - A robust and reproducible scapular coordinate system is necessary to study 
      scapulothoracic kinematics. The coordinate system recommended by the ISB 
      (International Society of Biomechanics) is difficult to apply in studies using 
      medical imaging, which mostly use a glenoid-centered coordinate system. The aim 
      of this study was to assess the robustness of a glenoid-centered coordinate 
      system compared with the ISB coordinate system, and to study the reproducibility 
      of this coordinate system measure during abduction. A Monte-Carlo analysis was 
      performed to test the robustness of the two coordinate systems. This method 
      enabled the variability of the orientation of the coordinate system to be 
      assessed in a laboratory setting. A reproducibility study of the glenoid-centered 
      coordinate system in the thorax reference frame was performed during abduction in 
      the scapular plane using a low-dose stereoradiography system. We showed that the 
      glenoid-centered coordinate system was slightly more robust than the 
      ISB-recommended coordinate system. Most reproducible rotation was upward/downward 
      rotation (x axis) and most reproducible translation was along the Y axis 
      (superior-inferior translation). In conclusion, the glenoid-centered coordinate 
      system can be used with confidence for scapular kinematics analysis. The 
      uncertainty of the measures derived from our technique is acceptable compared 
      with that reported in the literature. Functional quantitative analysis of the 
      scapulothoracic joint is possible with this method.

AB  - The reliability of joint rotation measurements is an issue of major interest, 
      especially in clinical applications. The effect of instrumental errors and soft 
      tissue artifacts on the variability of human motion measures is well known, but 
      the influence of the representation of joint motion has not yet been studied. The 
      aim of the study was to compare the within-subject reliability of three rotation 
      formalisms for the calculation of the shoulder elevation joint angles. Five 
      repetitions of humeral elevation in the scapular plane of 27 healthy subjects 
      were recorded using a stereophotogrammetry system. The humerothoracic joint 
      angles were calculated using the YX'Y" and XZ'Y" Euler angle sequences and the 
      attitude vector. A within-subject repeatability study was performed for the three 
      representations. ICC, SEM and CV were the indices used to estimate the error in 
      the calculation of the angle amplitudes and the angular waveforms with each 
      method. Excellent results were obtained in all representations for the main angle 
      (elevation), but there were remarkable differences for axial rotation and plane 
      of elevation. The YX'Y" sequence generally had the poorest reliability in the 
      secondary angles. The XZ'Y' sequence proved to be the most reliable 
      representation of axial rotation, whereas the attitude vector had the highest 
      reliability in the plane of elevation. These results highlight the importance of 
      selecting the method used to describe the joint motion when within-subjects 
      reliability is an important issue of the experiment. This may be of particular 
      importance when the secondary angles of motions are being studied.

TI  - Anatomic and non-anatomic reconstruction improves post-operative outcomes in 
      chronic acromio-clavicular instability: a systematic review.
PG  - 3779-3796
LID - 10.1007/s00167-019-05408-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To systematize the surgical outcomes of anatomic and non-anatomic 
      reconstruction in patients with chronic acromio-clavicular joint (ACJ) 
      instability and determine which technique is superior. METHODS: This review was 
      conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed and Cochrane Library 
      databases were searched up to April 30th, 2018 for original articles that 
      assessed the outcomes of one or more surgical techniques of anatomic and 
      non-anatomic reconstruction in patients with chronic ACJ instability. The 
      Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) was used to assess study 
      quality. Pre-to-post meta-analysis was performed for both anatomic and 
      non-anatomic reconstructions. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included 
      comprising 799 patients (mean age of 36.6 years old and 84% males) with a mean 
      follow-up of 34.6 months (range 13 to 74). Surgical techniques included anatomic 
      (tendinous or synthetic grafts/constructs) and non-anatomic reconstruction 
      (Weaver-Dunn or Modified Weaver-Dunn, conjoined tendon transfer, or temporary 
      hook plate). There were significant pre-to-post improvements on the constant 
      score with an average improvement ranging from 11.1 to 50.7 (p < 0.01). Average 
      failure rate was 7.6% (7.5% for anatomic and 8.5% for non-anatomic 
      reconstruction). Non-comparative studies had a mean MINORS score of 9 points (out 
      of 16) and comparative studies 17 (out of 24) with excellent interrater agreement 
      (k = 0.910). CONCLUSION: Both anatomic and non-anatomic ACJ reconstructions 
      provide significant post-operative improvements, but definitive conclusions on 
      optimal technique remain elusive. Notwithstanding, comparative studies support 
      the use of anatomic ACJ reconstruction which should be preferably used. However, 
      until superiority is demonstrated by robust studies, surgeons should supplement 
      their decision-making with experience and patient preference. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:

TI  - Functional morphology of the douc langur (Pygathrix spp.) scapula.
LID - 10.1002/ajp.22646 [doi]
AB  - Most colobine monkeys primarily move through their arboreal environment 
      quadrupedally. Douc langurs (Pygathrix spp.), however, are regularly observed to 
      use suspensory behaviors at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center (EPRC) in 
      Northern Vietnam. Previous work has linked variation in scapular morphology to 
      different modes of primate arboreal locomotion. Here we investigate whether the 
      shape of the Pygathrix scapula resembles obligate brachiators (gibbons) or 
      obligate arboreal quadrupeds (other cercopithecoids). Using a MicroScribe G2X 3D 
      digitizer, the positions of 17 landmarks were recorded on 15 different species of 
      nonhuman primates (n = 100) from three categories of locomotor behavior: 
      brachiator, arboreal quadruped, and unknown (Pygathrix). All analyses were 
      conducted in the R package geomorph. A Procrustes analysis uniformly scaled the 
      shape data and placed specimens into the same morphospace. A Principal Component 
      Analysis was used to examine scapular shape and a Procrustes ANOVA was conducted 
      to test for shape difference in the scapulae. A pairwise analysis was used to 
      compare the means of the locomotor categories and identify any statistically 
      significant differences. A phylogenetically controlled Procrustes ANOVA was also 
      conducted using a phylogeny from 10kTrees. Results show Pygathrix scapular 
      morphology is significantly different from both arboreal colobine quadrupeds 
      (p < 0.01) and hylobatid brachiators (p < 0.01). It does, however, share some 
      features with each including a long vertebral border, like other cercopithecoids, 
      and a more laterally projecting acromion process, like the hylobatids. The 
      principal difference segregating Pygathrix from both the arboreal quadrupeds and 
      the brachiators is the more medially placed superior angle. These nuanced 
      morphological characteristics associated with suspensory behaviors may be useful 
      for inferring suspensory locomotion in the primate fossil record.

TI  - Impact of vertical and horizontal malrotation on measurements of anteroposterior 
      radiographs of the scapula: need for standardized images in modern omometry.
PG  - 659-666
LID - S1058-2746(17)30666-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2017.10.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing number of parameters measured on anteroposterior 
      radiographs are used for the evaluation of the bony geometry of the scapula. 
      Inhomogeneous acquisition of images is common because of the lack of 
      standardization in radiographic positioning. Images with malrotation around the 
      horizontal axis of the scapula are particularly frequent. We hypothesized that 
      malrotated images would result in large variations in measured radiographic 
      parameters and that image standardization using qualitative and semiquantitative 
      "omometric" criteria would decrease these variations in measurements. "Omometry" 
      is a newly introduced umbrella term that contains all standardized measurements 
      on plain radiographs of the shoulder, analogous to the term "coxometry," which is 
      widely used for the radiographic assessment of the osseous pelvis and hip. 
      METHODS: In this experimental, cadaveric radiographic study, 7 dry-bone human 
      scapula cadaveric specimens from anonymous donors were used to obtain 210 
      radiographs. We incrementally rotated (steps of 3°) every scapula around its 
      horizontal and vertical axis, with a total range of 42° per each axis. Then, we 
      measured 5 radiographic parameters on every image and observed their change with 
      malrotation. Furthermore, we introduced 4 omometric criteria defining an 
      appropriate (presence of ≥3 criteria) radiographic image to improve 
      standardization of scapular image acquisition. RESULTS: Overall, measured values 
      remained stable within a narrow range of ±9° of malrotation. Beyond this range, 
      values of all parameters significantly deviated (>±2°) from the initial value. 
      Measurements on appropriate images were significantly less prone to deviation. 
      Within the appropriate images, those with 4 criteria showed a higher specificity 
      than those with 3 criteria. CONCLUSION: There is significant variation in values 
      of measured radiographic parameters on anteroposterior radiographs of the scapula 
      with substantially malrotated images. With the use of the 4 newly introduced 
      semiquantitative and qualitative omometric criteria, which define an appropriate 
      image, reliability of the measured parameters can be significantly improved.

TI  - The greater tuberosity angle: a new predictor for rotator cuff tear.
PG  - 1415-1421
LID - S1058-2746(18)30157-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2018.02.051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The implication of scapular morphology in rotator cuff tears has been 
      extensively studied. However, the role of the greater tuberosity (GT) should be 
      of equal importance. The aim of this study was to propose a new radiographic 
      marker, the GT angle (GTA), which measures the position of the GT in relation to 
      the center of rotation of the humeral head. The hypothesis was that a higher 
      angle value would be associated with a higher likelihood in detecting a rotator 
      cuff tear. METHODS: During 1 year, patients were prospectively recruited from a 
      single institution specialized shoulder clinic in 2 different groups. The patient 
      group consisted of individuals with a degenerative rotator cuff tear involving at 
      least the supraspinatus. The control group consisted of individuals with no 
      rotator cuff pathology. Individuals in both groups with congenital, 
      post-traumatic, or degenerative alterations of the proximal humerus were 
      excluded. The GTA was measured on an anteroposterior shoulder x-ray image with 
      the arm in neutral rotation by 3 observers at 2 different times. RESULTS: The 
      study recruited 71 patients (33 patients, 38 controls). Mean GTA value was 72.5° 
      (range, 67.6°-79.2°) in patients and 65.2° (range, 55.8°-70.5°) for controls 
      (P <.001). A value above 70° resulted in 93-fold higher odds of detecting a 
      rotator cuff tear (P <.001). Interobserver and intraobserver reliability were 
      high. CONCLUSIONS: GT morphology is implicated in rotator cuff tears. The GTA is 
      a reliable radiographic marker, with more than 70° being highly predictive in 
      detecting such lesions.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Clinical measurement. OBJECTIVE: To establish trial-to-trial 
      within-day and between-day reliability, standard error of measurement, and 
      minimal detectable change of scapular orientation during elevation and lowering 
      of the arm, and with the arm relaxed at the side, in individuals with and without 
      shoulder impingement. BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic devices are commonly used to 
      measure 3-D scapular kinematics during arm elevation in different conditions and 
      for intervention studies. However, there is a lack of studies that evaluate 
      within- and between-day reliability of these measurements. METHODS: The subjects 
      were allocated to either a control group or an impingement group. Kinematic data 
      were collected using the Flock of Birds electromagnetic device during elevation 
      and lowering of the arm in the sagittal plane on 2 different occasions, separated 
      by 3 to 5 days. Forty-nine subjects were tested for within-day reliability. 
      Forty-three subjects were reassessed for between-day reliability. RESULTS: 
      Intraclass correlation coefficients for within- and between-day assessment of 
      scapular orientation during elevation and lowering of the arm in both groups 
      ranged from 0.92 to 0.99 and from 0.54 to 0.88, respectively. Intraclass 
      correlation coefficients for assessment of scapular orientation with the arms 
      relaxed at the side in both groups ranged from 0.66 to 0.95. The standard error 
      of measurement for between-day measurements ranged from 3.37° to 7.44° for both 
      groups. The minimal detectable change for between-day measurements increased from 
      7.81° at the lower to 17.27° at the higher humerothoracic elevation angles. 
      CONCLUSION: These results support the use of Flock of Birds to measure scapular 
      orientations in subjects with and without impingement symptoms. The measurements 
      showed excellent within-day reliability but were not highly reliable over time.

AB  - The goal of this study was to develop and validate a non-invasive approach to 
      estimate scapular kinematics in individual patients. We hypothesized that 
      individualized mathematical algorithms can be developed using motion capture data 
      to accurately estimate dynamic scapula orientation based on measured humeral 
      orientations and acromion process positions. The accuracy of the mathematical 
      algorithms was evaluated against a gold standard of biplane fluoroscopy using a 
      2D to 3D fluoroscopy/model matching process. Individualized linear models were 
      developed for nine healthy adult shoulders. These models were used to predict 
      scapulothoracic kinematics, and the predicted kinematics were compared to 
      kinematics obtained using biplane fluoroscopy to determine the accuracy of the 
      algorithms. Results showed strong correlations between mathematically predicted 
      kinematics and validation kinematics. Estimated kinematics were within 8° of 
      validation kinematics. We concluded that individualized linear models show 
      promise for providing accurate, non-invasive measurements of scapulothoracic 
      kinematics in a clinical environment.

AB  - The purpose of our study was to establish criterion-related validity and 
      repeatability of a shoulder biomechanics testing protocol involving an 
      electromagnetic tracking system (Flock of Birds [FoB]). Eleven subjects completed 
      humeral elevation tasks in the sagittal, scapular, and frontal planes on two 
      occasions. Shoulder kinematics were assessed with a digital inclinometer and the 
      FoB. Intrasession and intersession repeatability for orthopedic angles, and 
      humeral and scapular kinematics ranged from moderate to excellent. Correlation 
      analyses revealed strong relationships between inclinometer and FoB measures of 
      humeral motion, yet considerable mean differences were noted between the 
      measurement devices. Our results validate use of the FoB for measuring humeral 
      kinematics and establish our testing protocol as reliable. We must continue to 
      consider factors that can impact system accuracy and the effects they may have on 
      kinematic descriptions and how data are reported.

AB  - The participation of scapula motion in arm movement is clinically well known and 
      recent three dimensional (3D) analyses using kinematic techniques have confirmed 
      its importance. Scapular motion relative to the thorax has a theoretical maximum 
      of 6 degrees of freedom (DoF), resulting from rotations at both clavicular joints 
      (3 rotational DoF each). However, most recent kinematic studies have only 
      analysed the 3D rotations of the scapula relative to the thorax. In the present 
      study, the 3D translations of the barycentre of the scapula were considered in 
      order to complete the description of movement at the shoulder complex. Eight 
      healthy subjects performed arm elevation in the sagittal and frontal planes, 
      simulated activities of daily living (hair combing and back washing) and maximum 
      voluntary scapula movement (forward and backward rolling). Measurements were 
      recorded using a 6 DoF electromagnetic device and the acromial method of analysis 
      was used. The results showed that 3D scapular rotations and translation of its 
      barycentre were functionally consistent for all tasks. A principal component 
      analysis (PCA) yielded three factors, explaining 97.6% of the variance. The first 
      two factors (protraction and shrug, according to clinical descriptions) combined 
      rotations and translations, consistent with the hypothesis that the scapula rolls 
      over the curved thoracic surface. The third factor related to lateral-medial 
      rotation, thus representing rotation in the plane tangential to the thorax. The 
      PCA suggested that scapular motion can be described using these 3 DoF. This 
      should be studied in a larger group of individuals, including patients with 
      pathological conditions.

AB  - The acromial tracker is used to measure scapular rotations during dynamic 
      movements. The method has low accuracy in high elevations and is sensitive to its 
      attachment location on the acromion. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      effect of the attachment position and shoulder orientation during calibration on 
      the tracker accuracy. The tracker was attached to one of three positions: near 
      the anterior edge of the acromion process, just above the acromial angle and the 
      meeting point between the acromion and the scapular spine. The scapula locator 
      was used to track the scapula during bilateral abduction simultaneously. The 
      locator was used to calibrate the tracker at: no abduction, 30°, 60°, 90° and 
      120° humerothoracic abduction. ANOVA tests compared RMS errors for different 
      attachment positions and calibration angles. The results showed that attaching 
      the device at the meeting point between the acromion and the scapular spine gave 
      the smallest errors and it was best to calibrate the device at 60° for elevations 
      ≤90°, at 120° for elevations >90° and at 90°or 120° for the full range of 
      abduction. The accuracy of the tracker is significantly improved if attached 
      appropriately and calibrated for the range of movement being measured.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort. INTRODUCTION: Assessment of scapular 
      dysfunction is considered important in the clinical evaluation and treatment of 
      patients with symptoms of subacromial impingement. However, sparse research has 
      been conducted into the reliability and predictive value of clinical tests with 
      which to identify scapular dyskinesis. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To evaluate 
      intrarater and interrater reliability and predictive value of the Scapular 
      Dyskinesis Test (SDT) in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome. METHODS: 
      Forty-five patients with subacromial impingement syndrome were included. The 
      presence of scapular dyskinesis was classified by 2 raters using the SDT. 
      Intrarater and interrater reliabilities were examined and compared. Patients with 
      and without scapular dyskinesis were compared in terms of Oxford Shoulder Score 
      and EQ-5D-5L scores at baseline and 3 months, as well rating of overall 
      improvement in shoulder condition. RESULTS: SDT could not be performed in 5 
      patients, leaving 40 patients for further analysis. Kappa with squared weights 
      was 0.64 for rater A and 0.86 for rater B; the intrarater agreement was 88% for A 
      and 96% for B. For interrater comparison, the Kappa value was 0.59 and agreement 
      86%. No statically significant differences in Oxford Shoulder Score and EQ-5D-5L 
      baseline and change scores or overall improvement in shoulder condition at 3 
      months were observed between patients with or without scapular dyskinesis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Intrarater and interrater reliability and agreement of the SDT were 
      determined. The findings that functional impairment and outcomes did not differ 
      between patients with or without the presences of scapular dyskinesis may 
      question the clinical value of the SDT in patients with subacromial impingement 
      syndrome. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1b.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate and reliable assessment of acromial tilt (ATA) and slope 
      (ASA) angles have been important in the clinical evaluation of degenerative and 
      traumatic rotator cuff tears. This study analyzed the influence of radiographic 
      viewing perspective on the ATA and ASA and developed criteria to identify true 
      lateral (TL) view radiographs. METHODS: Three-dimensional computed tomographic 
      (CT) reconstructions of 52 scapulae without rotator cuff tears or osteoarthritis 
      were studied. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were aligned to obtain a 
      TL view. In 10 random scapulae, incremental ante- and retroversion and up- and 
      downward rotation views were generated (10° increments, ±30°), and ATA and ASA 
      were measured by 2 observers. Clinically applicable criteria were developed and 
      validated to identify TL views. RESULTS: The mean ATA and ASA on TL views were 
      33°±4° (range 23°-42°) and 22°±7° (8°-43°), respectively. Mixed effect models 
      showed that DRRs malpositioned in 20° and 30° anteversion and downward rotation 
      decreased the ATA (P ≤ .030). DRRs malpositioned in anteversion and >10° of up- 
      and downward rotation demonstrated a significantly decreased ASA (P ≤ .047). 
      Intra- and interobserver reliability was excellent for TL views (intraclass 
      correlation coefficient ≥ 0.95) but decreased with increasing viewing angle. 
      Anatomic landmark criteria were capable of identifying TL-view radiographs with 
      sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 82%. CONCLUSION: Both ATA and ASA were 
      significantly affected by malposition in anteversion and downward rotation of the 
      scapula. Reliable ASA measurement was more susceptible in up- and downward 
      rotation than the ATA. New visual criteria can identify TL-view radiographs and 
      should be used in future studies to ensure consistency in ATA and ASA 
      measurement.

AB  - Accurate representation of individual scapula kinematics and subject geometries 
      is vital in musculoskeletal models applied to upper limb pathology and 
      performance. In applying individual kinematics to a model's cadaveric geometry, 
      model constraints are commonly prescriptive. These rely on thorax scaling to 
      effectively define the scapula's path but do not consider the area underneath the 
      scapula in scaling, and assume a fixed conoid ligament length. These constraints 
      may not allow continuous solutions or close agreement with directly measured 
      kinematics. A novel method is presented to scale the thorax based on palpated 
      scapula landmarks. The scapula and clavicle kinematics are optimised with the 
      constraint that the scapula medial border does not penetrate the thorax. Conoid 
      ligament length is not used as a constraint. This method is simulated in the UK 
      National Shoulder Model and compared to four other methods, including the 
      standard technique, during three pull-up techniques (n=11). These are 
      high-performance activities covering a large range of motion. Model solutions 
      without substantial jumps in the joint kinematics data were improved from 23% of 
      trials with the standard method, to 100% of trials with the new method. Agreement 
      with measured kinematics was significantly improved (more than 10° closer at 
      p<0.001) when compared to standard methods. The removal of the conoid ligament 
      constraint and the novel thorax scaling correction factor were shown to be key. 
      Separation of the medial border of the scapula from the thorax was large, 
      although this may be physiologically correct due to the high loads and high arm 
      elevation angles.

AB  - BACKGROUD: Reliable scapular upward rotation and anterior-posterior tilt data are 
      required for patients with subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS). Only a few 
      studies have explored the reliability of such measurements derived using a 
      modified inclinometer. OBJECTIVES: To determine the relative and absolute 
      reliability of scapular upward rotation and anterior-posterior tilt measurements 
      derived using a modified digital inclinometer in patients with SIS. METHOD: 
      Seventeen SIS patients were assessed twice within 1 week. We determined the 
      relative and absolute measurement reliability by calculating the intraclass 
      correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), and minimal 
      clinically important difference (MCID). Both intra- and interrater reliability 
      were determined. RESULTS: The intra-rater reliability (both measurements) was 
      high (0.72-0.88), and the interrater ICC was high to excellent (0.72-0.98). 
      Clinically acceptable SEM and MCID values were obtained for scapular upward 
      rotation (SEM: 4.28-9.33∘, MCID: 5.1-11.3∘) and anterior-posterior tilt (SEM: 
      3.72-7.55∘, MCID: 2.5-10.8∘). CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of scapular upward 
      rotation and anterior-posterior tilt using a modified digital inclinometer 
      reliably reveal scapular position and kinematics in patients with SIS.

AB  - The conventional acromion marker cluster (AMC) method used to estimate scapular 
      orientation cannot adequately represent complex shoulder movements due to soft 
      tissue artifacts. The regression method may have nonlinear error changes 
      depending on humeral elevation angle and elevation plane. Therefore, we aimed to 
      develop a new method of estimating scapular orientation using curved surface 
      interpolation during various shoulder movements, and to compare its accuracy with 
      conventional and regression methods. Thirteen healthy men were recruited. AMC and 
      refractive markers for bony landmarks were placed on the skin. During the 
      preprocess, several shoulder postures, including different arm elevations and 
      elevation planes, were measured using the motion capture system. Premeasured data 
      were used to calibrate the positional relationship between AMC and scapula using 
      curved surface interpolation. Subsequently, scapular orientations were estimated 
      by measuring AMC and body markers of any shoulder posture. To evaluate the 
      accuracy of our methods, 25 elevation postures and six tasks involving postures 
      common to activities of daily living were applied. For tasks requiring greater 
      arm elevation angles, the root mean square error was less in our method than in 
      the conventional and regression methods. Therefore, our method could improve the 
      accuracy of estimating scapular orientation in various elevation postures.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Following an increase in the incidence of scapular fractures and 
      interest in the outcome of their treatment, a basic classification system was 
      developed for ease of use in the emergency setting. It has been expanded to a 
      comprehensive system to allow for more in-depth classification of scapular 
      fractures for clinical research and surgical decision making. It focusses on 
      three specific regions of the scapula: the scapular body, the glenoid fossa and 
      the lateral scapular suspension system (LSSS). This article presents a 
      classification of the LSSS involvement to better characterise the injuries of 
      this region and to emphasise its relevance to evaluation of the position of the 
      scapula, hence the glenoid fossa, and so the centre of rotation of the shoulder 
      joint. METHODS: An iterative consensus and evaluation process comprising an 
      international group of seven experienced shoulder specialist and orthopaedic 
      trauma surgeons was used to specify and evaluate the failure of the LSSS 
      associated with scapula fractures. This was supported by a series of agreement 
      studies. The system considered lack of involvement (S0), incomplete (S1) and 
      complete (S2) failure of the LSSS. The last evaluation was conducted on a 
      consecutive collection of 120 scapula fractures documented by three-dimensional 
      computed tomography (3D CT) reconstruction videos. RESULTS: Surgeons agreed on 
      the involvement/failure of the LSSS in 47% of the 120 cases with an overall Kappa 
      of 0.54. The sample most likely included 70 S0, 29 S1 and 21 S2 cases, where 
      surgeons showed median classification accuracies of 93%, 71% and 80% for these 
      categories, respectively. While two surgeons showed some uncertainty about their 
      classification, the remaining surgeons only failed to identify LSSS failure in 
      <20% of the cases. Kappa coefficients of reliability for classification of 
      incomplete and complete LSSS involvement according to subcategories were 0.85 and 
      0.82, respectively. CONCLUSION: While LSSS involvement can be reliably 
      identified, its characterisation regarding complexity is problematic even with 3D 
      CT images. The proposed LSSS system is considered clinically relevant and 
      sufficient to further assess its role in treatment-decision processes and outcome 
      prognosis.

LID - 10.1186/1471-2474-14-315 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decreased scapulothoracic motion has been associated with various 
      pathologies of the shoulder. Reliable and simple assessment methods of scapular 
      mobility are, however lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      interrater reliability of four clinical tests to assess scapulothoracic motion in 
      patients with a slightly restricted shoulder flexion. METHODS: A total of 
      nineteen patients with a symptomatic slight restriction of shoulder flexion and 
      twenty asymptomatic subjects were evaluated. The investigation consisted of four 
      palpatory tests to assess scapulothoracic motion. A two-level rating scale 
      (positive, negative) was utilised. Interrater reliability was evaluated using 
      kappa coefficients. RESULTS: We found substantial to almost perfect (Kappa = 
      0.63-0.4) interrater reliability for the four tests. CONCLUSION: Our study 
      demonstrates that the four mobility tests of the shoulder are a reliable and 
      simple instrument to assess patients with a slightly restricted shoulder flexion. 
      Future studies should be conducted to evaluate the validity of these tests and to 
      establish their clinical usefulness.

TI  - Surgical management of Sprengel's deformity by a modification of Green's 
      procedure : A single center experience.
PG  - 255-259
LID - 10.1007/s00132-019-03818-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sprengel's deformity is a rare congenital anomaly that can present in 
      children, leading to cosmetic and functional impairment. This study investigated 
      clinical results of this deformity among cases managed using a modified Green 
      procedure. METHODS: From February 2008 to September 2015 a total of 34 patients 
      with Sprengel's deformity were treated with a modified Green procedure. The mean 
      age of patients at the time of surgery was 4.8 years (range 2-12 years) and the 
      average follow-up time was 6.1 years (range 4-10 years). The shoulder abduction, 
      Cavendish classification, Rigault classification, scapular elevation, and 
      postoperative complications were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean shoulder abduction 
      was 102.3° (range 70-140°) preoperatively and 142.6° (range 120-170°) 
      postoperatively. The scapular elevation was 4.2 cm (range 2-6.5 cm) 
      preoperatively and 1.35 cm (range 0-2 cm) postoperatively. Improvement by at 
      least one Cavendish and/or Rigault grade was attained in all cases 
      postoperatively. The differences in preoperative and postoperative shoulder 
      abduction, scapular elevation, Cavendish grade and Rigault grade were 
      statistically significant (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The modified Green procedure 
      is a relatively safe and reliable method in the treatment of severe Sprengel's 
      deformity, which ensures successful shoulder function as well as a good cosmetic 
      appearance.

      32(7): 1919-1922, 2018-This study aimed to determine the measurement accuracy of 
      triaxial accelerometers, to determine vertical stiffness (Kvert) during 
      overground running, and to examine the influence of device location. Seventeen 
      healthy adults wore 2 triaxial accelerometers (positioned between scapulae and at 
      lumbar spine) during a 2-minute continuous 20-m shuttle run (12 km·h), which was 
      repeated 7 days later. Accelerometer-derived Kvert data were compared with that 
      calculated from corresponding force-plate ground contacts (criterion measure). 
      Moderate correlations (r = 0.65-0.66) between the accelerometer and criterion 
      measure were identified, irrespective of unit location. However, 
      accelerometer-determined Kvert had questionable reliability in both positions 
      (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.70-0.71). These results suggest caution 
      be taken when using accelerometer-derived Kvert during overground running.

TI  - Modeling the effects of musculoskeletal geometry on scapulohumeral muscle moment 
      arms and lines of action.
PG  - 1311-1322
LID - 10.1080/10255842.2019.1661392 [doi]
AB  - Biomechanical investigations examining shoulder function commonly observe a high 
      degree of inter-individual variability in muscle activity and kinematic patterns 
      during static and dynamic upper extremity exertions. Substantial differences in 
      musculoskeletal geometry between individuals can alter muscle moment arms and 
      lines of action that, theoretically, alter muscle activity and shoulder 
      kinematics. The purposes of this research were to: (i) quantify model-predicted 
      functional roles (moment arms, lines of action) of the scapulohumeral muscles, 
      (ii) compare model predictions to experimental data in the literature, and (iii) 
      evaluate sensitivity of muscle functional roles due to changes in muscle 
      attachment locations using probabilistic modeling. Monte Carlo simulations were 
      performed to iteratively adjust muscle attachment locations at the clavicle, 
      scapula, and humerus of the Delft Shoulder and Elbow Model in OpenSim. Muscle 
      moment arms and lines of action were quantified throughout arm elevation in the 
      scapular plane. In general, model-predicted moment arms agreed well with the 
      reviewed literature; however, notable inconsistencies were observed when 
      comparing lines of action. Variability in moment arms and lines of action were 
      muscle-specific, with 2 standard deviations in moment arm and line of actions as 
      high as 25.8 mm and 18.8° for some muscles, respectively. Moment arms were 
      particularly sensitive to changes in attachment site closest to the joint centre. 
      Variations in muscle functional roles due to differences in musculoskeletal 
      geometry are expected to require different muscle activity and movement patterns 
      for upper extremity exertions.

TI  - The effect of isometric shoulder internal and external rotation on the 
      acromiohumeral distance.
PG  - 193-9
LID - 10.1097/PHM.0b013e31823c74ab [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the effect of isometric internal and 
      external rotation at various degrees of shoulder abduction on the acromiohumeral 
      distance (AHD). DESIGN: This was a prospective study that used a within-subject 
      repeated-measures design and randomization of independent variables. Data from 29 
      of 58 (40 women, 18 men) prospectively enrolled healthy subjects were used for 
      analysis. A still ultrasound image of the right subacromial space was taken to 
      measure the AHD for each of three contraction conditions (rest, isometric 
      internal, and external rotation) at three shoulder positions (neutral and 30 and 
      45 degrees of abduction). RESULTS: Intrarater reliability ranged from 0.86 to 
      0.99. At 45 degrees of shoulder abduction, the AHD was significantly smaller with 
      isometric external rotation when compared with no contraction (P = 0.0015) and 
      with isometric internal rotation (P = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: The AHD was not 
      affected by resistive isometric internal rotation of the shoulder, although it 
      decreased with resistive isometric external rotation at 45 degrees of shoulder 
      abduction. Resistive isometric shoulder external rotation in a position of 
      abduction should be used with caution when the goal is to maintain the AHD. 
      Further research is required to determine the effects of isometric contraction in 
      patients with subacromial impingement syndrome.

TI  - Fitting unanchored puzzle pieces in the skeleton: appropriate 3D scapular 
      positions for the quadrupedal support in tetrapods.
PG  - 857-869
LID - 10.1111/joa.12778 [doi]
AB  - Deducing the scapular positions of extinct tetrapod skeletons remains difficult, 
      because the scapulae and rib cage are connected with each other not directly by 
      skeletal joint, but by thoracic muscles. In extant non-testudine quadrupedal 
      tetrapods, the top positions of the scapulae/suprascapulae occur at the anterior 
      portion of the rib cage, above the vertebral column and near the median plane. 
      The adequacy of this position was tested using three-dimensional mechanical 
      models of Felis, Rattus and Chamaeleo that assumed stances on a forelimb on a 
      single side and the hindlimbs. The net moment about the acetabulum generated by 
      the gravity force and the contractive forces of the anti-gravity thoracic 
      muscles, and the resistance of the rib to vertical compression between the 
      downward gravity and upward lifting force from the anti-gravity thoracic muscle 
      depend on the scapular position. The scapular position common among quadrupeds 
      corresponds to the place at which the roll and yaw moments of the uplifted 
      portion of the body are negligible, where the pitch moment is large enough to 
      lift the body, and above the ribs having high strength against vertical 
      compression. These relationships between scapular position and rib cage 
      morphology should allow reliable reconstruction of limb postures of extinct taxa.

LID - 6621
AB  - This study investigated the characteristics of arm elevation via principal 
      component analysis in symptomatic overhead athletes with scapular dyskinesis. One 
      hundred-thirty-four overhead athletes with scapular dyskinesis [24: inferior 
      angle prominence (pattern I); 46: medial border prominence (pattern II), 64: 
      pattern I + II] were evaluated by three-dimensional electromagnetic motion and 
      electromyography to record the scapular kinematics (upward rotation/posterior 
      tipping/exterior rotation) and muscle activation (upper trapezius: UT; middle 
      trapezius: MT; lower trapezius: LT; serratus anterior: SA) during lowering phase 
      of arm elevation. The results showed: (1) for pattern I and II, the first 3 
      principal component (PCs) explained 41.4% and 42.6% of total variance of 
      movement; (2) the first PCs were correlated with MT, LT activity (r = 0.41~0.61) 
      and upward rotation, posterior tipping (r = -0.59~-0.33) in pattern I, and UT, 
      MT, SA (r = 0.30~0.70) activity in pattern II; (3) contour plots of muscle 
      activity demonstrated that muscle activities varied with dyskinesis patterns. In 
      summary, for the pattern I, the major characteristics are coactivation of MT and 
      LT and corresponding scapular posterior tipping and upward rotation. For the 
      pattern II, the major characteristics are coactivation of UT, MT and SA without 
      corresponding scapular external rotation.

AB  - Cadaveric experiments were undertaken to validate a finite element (FE) modeling 
      approach for studying impingement-related scapular notching in reverse shoulder 
      arthroplasty (RSA). The specific focus of the validation was contact at the site 
      of impingement between the humeral polyethylene component and the inferior aspect 
      of the scapula during an adduction motion. Lateralization of the RSA center of 
      rotation was varied because it has been advocated clinically to reduce 
      impingement and presumably decrease the risk of scapular notching. Tekscan 
      sensors were utilized to directly measure contact stress at the impingement site, 
      and FE was used to compute contact stresses. Favorable agreement was seen between 
      physically measured and FE-computed impingement site location (within one sensing 
      element of the Tekscan sensor) and contact loads (mean absolute difference of 
      14.9%). Contact stresses and contact areas were difficult to compare directly due 
      to the disparate spatial resolutions of the Tekscan sensor and the FE model. 
      FE-computed contact at the impingement site was highly focal, with a total 
      contact area comparable to the area of an individual Tekscan sensing element. The 
      good agreement between the physically measured and FE-computed contact data 
      (i.e., contact load and location) support the use of FE modeling as a tool for 
      computationally testing the efficacy of changing various surgical variables 
      associated with RSA.

      shoulder complex.
PG  - 4815-4818
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857528 [doi]
AB  - Patient-specific biomechanical simulations of joints require accurate 
      reconstruction of bony anatomy from medical image data. The articular geometries 
      of the joints may influence their biomechanics. Statistical shape models (SSMs) 
      have become ubiquitous in the literature and aim to capture the natural variation 
      of biological objects. They work by learning the variation from training examples 
      to define the space of valid biological shapes. However, the kinematic 
      information descriptive of the anato-physiological relationship of two 
      interacting objects is not generally encoded in the SSM. Here, we propose a 
      framework for developing combined statistical shape and kinematics models (SSKMs) 
      as Gaussian process morphable models to analyse the shape and kinematics 
      relationship. We demonstrate the framework on a three-dimensional (3D) image data 
      set consisting of ten right-handed cadaveric shoulder joints acquired using 
      computed tomography. Additionally, we simulate specific bone motions to encode 
      kinematics in the combined model. Our SSKM built from shoulder data (matching 
      scapulae and humeri) correctly depicts a correlation between the shape and 
      kinematics as hypothesized. We furthermore demonstrate the ability to marginalize 
      from the SSKM to obtain shape-only variation and kinematics-only variation. 
      Future work aims to use the SSKM framework to understand the relationships 
      between kinematics and shape for various joints as well as to develop 
      patient-specific computational models to evaluate joint biomechanics.

TI  - Validity of Clinical Measurement Instruments Assessing Scapular Function: 
      Insufficient Evidence to Recommend Any Instrument for Assessing Scapular Posture, 
      Movement, and Dysfunction-A Systematic Review.
PG  - 632-641
LID - 10.2519/jospt.2020.9265 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the construct validity, criterion validity, and 
      responsiveness of measurement instruments evaluating scapular function. DESIGN: 
      Systematic review of measurement properties. LITERATURE SEARCH: The MEDLINE, 
      Embase, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases were systematically searched from 
      inception until March 2019. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies published in Dutch, 
      English, or German were included when they evaluated at least 1 of the 
      measurement properties of interest. No restrictions were made regarding 
      participants' health status. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently 
      evaluated study quality using the COSMIN checklist and extracted and analyzed 
      data. Quality of evidence was graded by measurement property for each distinctive 
      type of measurement. RESULTS: Thirty-one measurement instruments in 14 studies 
      were categorized into instruments to measure scapular posture and movement, and 
      to assess scapular dyskinesis. Quality of evidence was at most moderate for 4 
      instruments with respect to criterion validity. Of these, criterion validity for 
      instruments measuring scapular protraction/retraction posture and rotation angles 
      up to 120° of thoracohumeral elevation was sufficient. Criterion validity for 
      instruments measuring asymmetrical scapular posture, range of motion, and the 
      lateral scapular slide test was insufficient. Quality of evidence for measurement 
      properties of all other instruments was graded lower. CONCLUSION: There is 
      currently insufficient evidence to recommend any instrument for the clinical 
      examination of scapular function. Measurement instruments to assess scapular 
      dyskinesis are prone to misinterpretation and should therefore not be used as 
      such. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2020;50(11):632-641. doi:10.2519/jospt.2020.9265.

AB  - Age affects gross shoulder range of motion (ROM), but biomechanical changes over 
      a lifetime are typically only characterized for the humerothoracic joint. 
      Suitable age-related baselines for the scapulothoracic and glenohumeral 
      contributions to humerothoracic motion are needed to advance understanding of 
      shoulder injuries and pathology. Notably, biomechanical comparisons between 
      younger or older populations may obscure detected differences in underlying 
      shoulder motion. Herein, biplane fluoroscopy and skin-marker motion analysis 
      quantified humerothoracic, scapulothoracic, and glenohumeral motion during 3 
      static poses (resting neutral, internal rotation to L4-L5, and internal rotation 
      to maximum reach) and 2 dynamic activities (scapular plane abduction and external 
      rotation in adduction). Orientations during static poses and rotations during 
      active ROM were compared between subjects <35 years and >45 years of age (N = 10 
      subjects per group). Numerous age-related kinematic differences were measured, 
      ranging 5-22°, where variations in scapular orientation and motion were 
      consistently observed. These disparities are on par with or exceed mean 
      clinically important differences and standard error of measurement of clinical 
      ROM, which indicates that high resolution techniques and appropriately matched 
      controls are required to avoid confounding results of studies that investigate 
      shoulder kinematics. Understanding these dissimilarities will help clinicians 
      manage expectations and treatment protocols where indications and prevalence 
      between age groups tend to differ. Where possible, it is advised to select 
      age-matched control cohorts when studying the kinematics of shoulder injury, 
      pathology, or surgical/physical therapy interventions to ensure clinically 
      important differences are not overlooked.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment of the critical shoulder angle (CSA) is important 
      in clinical evaluation of degenerative rotator cuff tears. This study analyzed 
      the influence of radiographic viewing perspective on the CSA, developed a 
      classification system to identify malpositioned radiographs, and assessed the 
      relationship between the CSA and demographic factors. METHODS: Glenoid height, 
      width, and retroversion were measured on 3-dimensional computed tomography 
      reconstructions of 68 cadaver scapulae. A digitally reconstructed radiograph was 
      aligned perpendicular to the scapular plane, and retroversion was corrected to 
      obtain a true anteroposterior (AP) view. In 10 scapulae, incremental 
      anteversion/retroversion and flexion/extension views were generated. The CSA was 
      measured, and a clinically applicable classification system was developed to 
      detect views with >2° change in CSA vs. true AP view. RESULTS: The average CSA 
      was 33° ± 4°. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability was high (intraclass 
      correlation coefficient ≥ 0.81) but decreased with increasing viewing angle. 
      Views beyond 5° anteversion, 8° retroversion, 15° flexion, and 26° extension 
      resulted in >2° deviation of the CSA compared with the true AP view. The 
      classification system was capable of detecting aberrant viewing perspectives with 
      sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 53%. Correlations between glenoid size and 
      CSA were small (R ≤ 0.3), and CSA did not vary by gender (P = .426) or side (P = 
      .821). CONCLUSIONS: The CSA was most susceptible to malposition in 
      anteversion/retroversion. Deviations as little as 5° in anteversion resulted in a 
      CSA >2° from true AP view. A new classification system refines the ability to 
      collect true AP radiographs of the scapula. The CSA was unaffected by demographic 
      factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess interexaminer agreement in a structured, manual, clinical 
      examination of the neck. To correlate these data with the score in a functional 
      questionnaire (a validated, French-language version of the neck pain and 
      disability scale). PATIENTS: Fifty-nine ambulatory patients (26 males and 33 
      females, mean+/-SD age: 46.3+/-12 yrs) with common neck pain but no radiation 
      below the elbow. METHODS: Two medical practitioners (a junior and a senior 
      consultant) assessed neck rotation (in degrees) and the presence of pain during 
      maximum neck flexion and extension, muscle palpation trapezius, levator scapulae, 
      splenius cervicis, semispinalis) and cervical spine palpation. Cohen's kappa 
      coefficient was calculated for qualitative variables. Angular rotational values 
      (as a continuous variable) were compared using the p coefficient. Pearson 
      coefficient was used to correlate the number of tender spots to the results of 
      the questionnaire. RESULTS: There was no significant interexaminer difference 
      (+/-10 degrees) in the neck rotation measurement. Kappa was (i) 0.71 and 0.76 for 
      pain in flexion or extension, respectively, (ii) 0.44 on average for palpation of 
      various muscles and (iii) 0.53 on average for cervical spine palpation. The 
      number of tender spots correlated strongly with the questionnaire score 
      (Pearson's coefficient: 0.35; p=0.007). CONCLUSION: The interexaminer agreement 
      for our clinical examination was moderate. The number of tender spots correlated 
      strongly with the functional impairment. Pain at the lower attachment of the 
      levator scapulae was associated with dysfunction of the median or upper cervical 
      spine.

      electrical inclinometer.
PG  - 419-23

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of a modified 
      two-dimensional electrical inclinometer to measure scapular upward rotation 
      during static humeral elevation. Numerous techniques have been proposed to 
      qualitatively and quantitatively measure upward rotation of the scapula. These 
      techniques are limited by expense or an inability to be synchronized with other 
      measurements, such as muscle activity and force output. For validity testing, 
      static scapular upward rotation was measured separately with a digital protractor 
      and electrical inclinometer while participants were at rest and 60°, 90° and 120° 
      of humeral elevation in the scapular plane. For reliability testing, either 20 
      min before or 20 min after validity testing, participants performed the testing 
      positions while measurements were taken with the electrical inclinometer only. 
      Significant correlations existed between the modified electrical inclinometer and 
      digital protractor at all four positions (r>0.996, p<0.001). The electrical 
      inclinometer demonstrated good to excellent intra-rater reliability 
      (ICC(3,1)>0.892, 95%CI: 0.785-0.988 and SEM<1.8°). These results support the use 
      of the electrical inclinometer to measure scapular upward rotation. These 
      findings provide clinicians and researchers with a practical instrument that can 
      accurately measure scapular upward rotation in synchrony with other measurements, 
      such as electromyography and isokinetic data.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of transfer of 
      the sternal head of the pectoralis major with its bone insertion to the inferior 
      pole of the scapula for symptomatic winging. METHODS: Our study included 51 
      patients with serratus anterior dysfunction secondary to chronic muscle or long 
      thoracic nerve injury. Indications included pain, scapular winging, and limited 
      active motion after failed conservative management. All patients underwent 
      transfer of the sternal head of the pectoralis major with its bone insertion to 
      the scapular inferior pole. Computed tomography scan was performed at 3 months 
      postoperatively to evaluate bone healing. RESULTS: At an average follow-up of 29 
      months (range, 12-46 months), 45 patients had complete and 6 patients had partial 
      resolution of the scapular winging. Patients had significant improvements in 
      their shoulder abduction, forward flexion, and pain levels (P < .01). The mean 
      shoulder Constant score improved from 49 preoperatively to 82 postoperatively; 
      the shoulder subjective value improved from 60% to 84%; and the Disabilities of 
      the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score improved from 58 to 14 (P < .01). Computed 
      tomography scans at an average of 3 months postoperatively demonstrated full 
      healing in 41 patients and partial healing in 10. CONCLUSION: Pectoralis major 
      transfer of the sternal head with its bone insertion to the inferior pole of the 
      scapula is a reliable transfer to stabilize and to restore the function of the 
      scapula in patients with symptomatic winging. This technique allows the ability 
      to directly transfer the tendon to the scapula with bone-to-bone healing, leading 
      to faster healing and a quicker return to unrestricted activities.

TI  - The effect of glenoid component version and humeral polyethylene liner rotation 
      on subluxation and impingement in reverse shoulder arthroplasty.

LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2017.03.027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A previously validated finite element modeling approach was used to 
      determine how changes in glenoid component version and polyethylene liner 
      rotation within the humeral component affect the arm abduction angle at which 
      impingement between the inferior glenoid and the polyethylene liner occurs as 
      well as the amount of subluxation generated by that impingement. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Five glenoid component versions (5° anteversion; neutral; 5°, 10°, and 
      20° retroversion) and 7 polyethylene liner rotations (20° and 10° anterior; 
      neutral; 10°, 20°, 30°, and 40° posterior) were considered, resulting in 35 
      different clinically representative models. The humerus was internally and 
      externally rotated and extended and flexed, and the resulting impingement and 
      subluxation were measured. To further analyze more global trends and to identify 
      implantations least prone to subluxation, polyethylene liner rotation was 
      additionally varied in coarser 30° increments across the entire 360° range. 
      RESULTS: All subluxation caused by impingement occurred during external rotation 
      and extension, and external rotation produced nearly 10-fold more subluxation 
      than extension. Neutral glenoid component version was associated with the least 
      amount of subluxation for all polyethylene liner rotations. Posteriorly rotated 
      polyethylene liners, which place the thick inferior region of the component away 
      from the scapula, produced the least amount of subluxation. The 90° and 120° 
      posterior liner rotations produced no subluxation, whereas the 30° and 60° 
      anterior liner rotations produced the greatest amount of subluxation. CONCLUSION: 
      These results indicate that rotating modern radially asymmetric humeral 
      polyethylene liners posteriorly can reduce the risk of subluxation leading to 
      dislocation and increase external rotation range of motion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study used a 3D digitizer to determine three-dimensional motion 
      analysis of the 2nd cervical (C2) spinous process at end range cervical rotation 
      with the scapula in different positions. METHODS: 30 healthy adults participated 
      in this study. Different scapula positions were adopted bilaterally and 
      positioned passively at normal resting, depression, adduction, and abduction. 
      Under each scapula position, bilateral end range cervical rotation and 
      displacement of the C2 spinous process were analyzed by a 3D digitizer. RESULTS: 
      Displacement of the C2 spinous process relative to the occiput was significantly 
      correlated with range of cervical rotation under all scapular positions (p<0.05). 
      However, there were no significant differences between end range cervical 
      rotation and displacement of the C2 spinous process relative to the occiput in 
      any scapular position. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that measurement of 
      upper cervical mobility using the 3D digitizer is a reliable method that holds 
      promise in the evaluation of people with cervical spine disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have proposed various ways to assess scapular 
      dyskinesis. In clinic, assessment tools designed to measure the posterior 
      displacement of the inferior angle of the scapula with reference to the posterior 
      thoracic cage are needed. OBJECTIVES: A novel scapulometer was developed to 
      measure scapular medial border and inferior angle prominence. METHODS: A novel 
      scapulometer was designed to measure the distance from the root of the spine 
      (ROS) and the inferior angle (INF) of the scapula to the thorax wall in 29 
      participants with scapular dyskinesis bilaterally. Two raters measured the ROS 
      and INF distance of the scapula 3 times bilaterally. Intraclass correlation 
      coefficients (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM) were calculated to 
      determine the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. Validity was based on 
      correlations (convergent: ROS and internal/external rotation, and INF and tilt; 
      divergent: ROS/INF and upward rotation of the scapula) using a FASTRAK Polhemus 
      3-D motion tracking system assessing scapular tilt, internal/external rotation, 
      and upward/downward rotation. RESULTS: The average ROS and INF displacements were 
      13.7 ± 5.0 mm and 12.5 ± 6.3 mm, respectively. The results showed excellent 
      intra-rater and inter-rater reliability, with ICC = 0.88-0.99 and 0.95-0.99 
      (SEM = 0.7-0.8 mm), respectively. Correlations were 0.35/0.19 (convergent 
      validity) and 0.07/0.09 (divergent validity). CONCLUSIONS: The novel scapulometer 
      has excellent reliability and fair validity to quantify medial border and 
      inferior angle prominence of the scapula. Further research utilizing this 
      instrument is recommended.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to design and validate a functional 
      assessment scale for assisted gait with forearm crutches (Chamorro Assisted Gait 
      Scale-CHAGS) and to assess its reliability in people with sprained ankles. 
      DESIGN: Thirty subjects who suffered from sprained ankle (anterior talofibular 
      ligament first and second degree) were included in the study. A modified Delphi 
      technique was used to obtain the content validity. The selected items were: 
      pelvic and scapular girdle dissociation(1), deviation of Center of Gravity(2), 
      crutch inclination(3), steps rhythm(4), symmetry of step length(5), cross 
      support(6), simultaneous support of foot and crutch(7), forearm off(8), facing 
      forward(9) and fluency(10). Two raters twice visualized the gait of the sample 
      subjects which were recorded. The criterion-related validity was determined by 
      correlation between CHAGS and Coding of eight criteria of qualitative gait 
      analysis (Viel Coding). Internal consistency and inter and intra-rater 
      reliability were also tested. RESULTS: CHAGS obtained a high and negative 
      correlation with Viel Coding. We obtained a good internal consistency and the 
      intra-class correlation coefficients oscillated between 0.97 and 0.99, while the 
      minimal detectable changes were acceptable. CONCLUSION: CHAGS scale is a valid 
      and reliable tool for assessing assisted gait with crutches in people with 
      sprained ankles to perform partial relief of lower limbs.

TI  - Simulation in shoulder arthroplasty education using three-dimensional planning 
      software: the role of guidelines and predicted range of motion.
PG  - 2653-2661
LID - 10.1007/s00264-021-05155-6 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To demonstrate how reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) planning software 
      could be used to improve how the trainees position glenoid and humeral implants 
      and obtain optimal simulated range of motion (ROM). METHODS: We selected four 
      groups of five various level participants: medical student (MS), junior resident 
      (JR), senior resident (SR), and shoulder expert (SE). Thereafter, the 20 
      participants planned five cases of arthritic shoulders for a RSA on a validated 
      planning software following three phases: (1) no guidelines and no ROM feedback, 
      (2) guidelines but no ROM feedback, and (3) guidelines and ROM feedback. We 
      evaluated the final simulated impingement-free ROM, the choice of the implant 
      (baseplate size, graft, glenosphere), and the glenoid implant positioning. 
      RESULTS: MS planning were significantly improved by the ROM feedback only. JR 
      took the best advantage of both guidelines and ROM in final results. SR planning 
      were less performant than SE into phase 1 regarding flexion, external rotation, 
      and adduction (respectively - 10°, p = 0.03; - 11°, p = 0.003; and - 3°, 
      p = 0,03), but reached similar results into phase 3 (respectively - 2°, 
      p = 0.329; - 4°, p = 0.44; - 2°, p = 0.319). For MS, JR, and SR, we observed a 
      systematic improvement in the agreement over the study course. The glenoid 
      diameter remained highly variable even for SE. Comparing glenoid implant position 
      to SE, the distance error decreased with advancing phases. CONCLUSION: Planning 
      software can be used as a simulation training tool to improve implant positioning 
      in shoulder arthroplasty procedures.

TI  - Development and ex-vivo assessment of a novel patient specific guide and

PG  - e0251880

LID - e0251880
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and assess a novel guidance technique and instrumentation 
      system for minimally invasive short-stemmed total shoulder arthroplasty that will 
      help to reduce the complications associated with traditional open replacement 
      such as poor muscle healing and neurovascular injury. We have answered key 
      questions about the developed system including (1) can novel patient-specific 
      guides be accurately registered and used within a minimally invasive 
      environment?; (2) can accuracy similar to traditional techniques be achieved? 
      METHODS: A novel intra-articular patient-specific guide was developed for use 
      with a new minimally invasive posterior surgical approach that guides bone 
      preparation without requiring muscle resection or joint dislocation. 
      Additionally, a novel set of instruments were developed to enable bone 
      preparation within the minimally invasive environment. The full procedure was 
      evaluated in six cadaveric shoulders, using digitizations to assess accuracy of 
      each step. RESULTS: Patient-specific guide registration accuracy in 3D 
      translation was 2.2±1.2mm (RMSE±1 SD; p = 0.007) for the humeral component and 
      2.7±0.7mm (p<0.001) for the scapula component. Final implantation accuracy was 
      2.9±3.0mm (p = 0.066) in translation and 5.7-6.8±2.2-4.0° (0.001<p<0.009) across 
      the humerus implants' three rotations. Similarly, the glenoid component's 
      implantation accuracy was 3.0±1.7mm (p = 0.008) in translation and 
      2.3-4.3±2.2-4.4° (0.008<p<0.09) in rotation. CONCLUSION: This system achieves 
      minimally invasive shoulder replacement with accuracy similar to traditional open 
      techniques while avoiding common causes of complications. SIGNIFICANCE: This 
      novel technique could lead to a paradigm shift in shoulder arthroplasty for 
      patients with moderate arthritis, which could significantly improve 
      rehabilitation and functional outcomes.

TI  - Accuracy of digitization of bony landmarks for measuring change in scapular 
      attitude.
PG  - 349-61
AB  - Digitizing bony landmarks is a common technique used to measure scapular 
      position, but it has not been validated against a gold standard. The aim of this 
      study was to determine the accuracy of this technique for four physiological arm 
      movements using optoelectronic markers mounted on scapular bone pins as a gold 
      standard. Eight subjects had bone pins inserted into their lateral scapular 
      spine. Three points were digitized on the scapula with an optoelectronic probe: 
      the medial root of the scapular spine, the posterolateral corner of the acromion, 
      and the inferior angle of the scapula. The four active movements tested in this 
      study were glenohumeral abduction, glenohumeral horizontal adduction, hand behind 
      back, and forward reaching. The three bony landmarks were digitized six times in 
      three different positions for each movement. Data from one subject were rejected 
      secondary to pin loosening. The overall position-specific r.m.s. errors ranged 
      from 2.0 degrees to 12.5 degrees. The full abduction position had considerably 
      higher r.m.s. errors than the other positions (posterior tipping, 12.5 degrees; 
      upward rotation, 7.3 degrees; internal rotation, 12.0 degrees). It appears that 
      the digitization of bony landmarks may be a valid method for measuring changes in 
      scapular attitude with the following caveats: the full abduction position has a 
      high r.m.s. error, and small scapular motions have high percentage errors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plain radiographs still play a role in management of extraarticular 
      scapular neck fractures. Glenopolar angle (GPA) is one of the radiograph 
      measurements that is used to determine the necessity for surgery. Our aim was to 
      establish reliability of GPA on plain radiograph in patients with extraarticular 
      scapular neck fractures. METHODS: We performed a multicentre retrospective study 
      including all patients with extraarticular scapular neck fractures with available 
      imaging between 2006 and 2012. We excluded intra-articular glenoid fractures, 
      scapular blade fractures, acromion fractures, and scapular spine fractures. We 
      compared GPA on plain radiograph with three dimensional computed tomography (3D 
      CT) measurement, as well as contribution of radiograph rotational error, glenoid 
      inclination, and medial shortening of glenoid fragment towards GPA measurement. 
      RESULTS: One hundred patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean difference 
      between the GPA measurements on radiographs and 3D CT was 6.1±0.85° (95% 
      confidence interval) as an absolute value. In terms of contribution to GPA 
      values, GPA changed by one degree with ten degrees of radiograph rotational 
      error, three degrees of glenoid inclination, and three millimetres of glenoid 
      fragment medial shortening. CONCLUSION: Plain radiograph can provide a clinician 
      with a reasonable estimation of the GPA. Glenoid inclination has a greater 
      influence on GPA compared to medial shortening.

AB  - Biomechanical measures are used to characterize the mechanisms of treatment for 
      shoulder pain. The objective was to characterize test-retest reliability and 
      measurement error of shoulder surface electromyographic(sEMG) and kinematic 
      measures. Individuals(n = 12) with subacromial pain syndrome were tested at 2 
      visits. Five repetitions of shoulder scapular plane elevation were performed 
      while collecting sEMG of the upper trapezius(UT), middle trapezius(MT), lower 
      trapezius(LT), serratus anterior(SA) middle-deltoid, and infraspinatus muscles 
      during ascending and descending phases. Simultaneously, electromagnetic sensors 
      measured 3-dimensional kinematics of scapular internal/external rotation, 
      upward/downward rotation, posterior/anterior tilt, and clavicular 
      elevation/depression and clavicular protraction/retraction. Kinematic and sEMG 
      variables were reduced for the total phase of ascending and descending elevation 
      (30°-120°, 120°-30°), at 30° intervals for sEMG, and at every 30° discrete 
      kinematic angle. The intraclass correlation coefficients(ICC) ranged from 0.08 to 
      0.99 for sEMG and 0.23-0.95 for kinematics. Correspondingly, the standard error 
      of the measurement(SEM) and minimal detectable change(MDC) for sEMG measures 
      varied from 2.3% to 103.8% of a reference contraction(REF-contraction). For 
      kinematics, the SEM and MDC varied from 1.4° to 5.9°. Between-day reliability was 
      good to very good, except for scapular internal/external rotation kinematics, and 
      sEMG for the LT, UT, and SA. sEMG error values were highest (>25%REF-contraction) 
      for most of the LT, UT, and SA variables. Kinematic error values indicate changes 
      or differences of 2°-3° are meaningful, except for upward/downward rotation and 
      internal/external rotation with MDCs of 4°-6°. Generally, data from the total 
      phase of movement had better reliability and lower error than the data from sEMG 
      interval or kinematic discrete angles.

TI  - Model-based RSA is suitable for clinical trials on the glenoid component of 
      reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.
PG  - 3299-3307
LID - 10.1002/jor.24111 [doi]
AB  - This study aims to validate model-based radiostereometric analysis (RSA) on the 
      glenoid component of reversed total shoulder arthroplasty. We compared two 
      different modalities of model-based RSA, elementary geometrical shapes and 
      reversed engineering. We also explored two different ways to position the patient 
      to obtain different projections of the implant, the hip-position (transversal) 
      and shoulder-position (sagittal). Phantom accuracy was determined by performing 
      nine translations (x, y, z) and five rotations (x, y, z), and expressed as the 
      mean difference between RSA measurements and micrometer values. Precision was 
      measured using 12 double examinations of the phantom and 19 in patients, and 
      expressed as1.96 × standard deviations of the paired differences between double 
      examinations. The accuracy was high for both modalities, but rotation around the 
      symmetrical axis of the implant could not be measured using reversed engineering. 
      Clinical precision ranged from 0.13 to 0.25 mm for translations, and 0.4° to 0.7° 
      for rotations, using reversed engineering. For elementary geometrical shapes, the 
      precision ranged from 0.18 to 0.34 mm for translations, and 0.8° to 1.8° for 
      rotations. The hip-position was abandoned due to poor implant visualization. 
      Model-based RSA on the glenoid component of reversed total shoulder arthroplasty 
      has a high precision and accuracy, comparable to RSA results on hips and knees. 
      Patient positioning is vital for obtaining adequate results. We found that 
      reversed engineering was the more reliable method, and recommend reversed 
      engineering as the method of choice for further clinical RSA investigation of the 
      glenoid component of reversed total shoulder arthroplasty. © 2018 Orthopaedic

TI  - Relationship between coracoacromial arch and rotator cuff analysed by a 
      computer-assisted method.
PG  - 174-9
LID - 10.1002/rcs.182 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this paper we describe and assess the feasibility of a 
      computer-assisted method which could be useful to investigate the mechanism of 
      subacromial impingment of the shoulder. METHODS: The relationship between the 
      infraspinatus and supraspinatus and the coracoacromial (CA) arch during passive 
      elevation and abduction are described. The methodology is based on the use of a 
      tracker for recording surfaces and passive movements and data elaboration using 
      dedicated software. RESULTS: In four cadavers, we observed that the minimal 
      distances between the rotator cuff insertions and CA arch were realized at 45 
      degrees abduction between the acromion and infraspinatus, at 50-90 degrees 
      elevation between the acromion and supraspinatus and also at 45-70 degrees 
      abduction between the CA ligament and supraspinatus. This study showed that the 
      proposed method is able to provide repeatable kinematic data (ICC > or = 0.90), 
      numerical anatomical data comparable with the literature and, moreover, 
      individual measurements on the shoulder joint. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary 
      results support the extension of the methodology to an in vivo protocol to be 
      used during computer-assisted arthroscopic surgery.

LID - S0031-9406(16)30018-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.physio.2016.03.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of isometric shoulder extension in 90° 
      shoulder flexion on the acromio-humeral distance, to establish the force required 
      to achieve a clinically important increase in the acromio-humeral distance, and 
      to investigate the practicality and reliability of real-time ultrasound 
      measurement of the acromio-humeral distance in 90° shoulder forward flexion. 
      DESIGN: Prospective single-group intervention. SETTING: King's College London, 
      Guy's Campus. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty healthy volunteers [five males and 15 females 
      (40 shoulders)] with a mean age of 32 (standard deviation 10, range 19 to 55) 
      years were recruited from the faculty and staff at King's College London. 
      INTERVENTIONS: The acromio-humeral distance in asymptomatic participants was 
      measured using real-time ultrasound in the neutral position at rest, at 90° 
      shoulder flexion at rest, and while performing an isometric pull-down exercise at 
      100%, 50%, 30% and 10% maximal voluntary isometric contraction. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Real-time ultrasound measures of the acromio-humeral distance. RESULTS: 
      Of the 20 participants, 38 shoulders were imaged. In 90° shoulder flexion, 
      pull-down exercises at all levels of force increased the acromio-humeral distance 
      compared with no pull-down (P<0.05), but this was only clinically significant in 
      males. Measures had excellent short-term intra-operator reliability. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Isometric pull-down exercises lead to an increase in the acromio-humeral distance 
      in asymptomatic males that may be clinically important, and therefore may be an 
      appropriate exercise for patients with shoulder pathology. Ultrasound measurement 
      of the acromio-humeral distance in 90° shoulder flexion is practical and 
      reliable.

TI  - The intertester reliability of the Scapular Assistance Test.
PG  - 653-60
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Test-retest reliability study. OBJECTIVE: To determine interrater 
      reliability of the modified scapular assistance test (SAT). The modified SAT is 
      designed to assess the contribution of scapular motion to shoulder pain. 
      BACKGROUND: Abnormal scapular motion has been implicated in different shoulder 
      disorders. However, there is a lack of clinical evaluation tools to assess the 
      scapular component of shoulder dysfunction. METHODS AND MEASURES: Forty-six 
      subjects who were referred to physical therapy for treatment of various shoulder 
      pathologies were recruited for this study. The modified SAT was performed on each 
      participant by 2 different examiners. Percent agreement and kappa coefficient 
      were utilized to determine interrater reliability of the modified SAT. RESULTS: 
      The kappa coefficient and percent agreement were .53 and 77%, respectively, when 
      the test was performed in the scapular plane, and .62 and 91%, respectively, when 
      the test was performed in the sagittal plane. CONCLUSIONS: The modified SAT 
      possesses acceptable interrater reliability for clinical use.

AB  - A total of 11 male and 19 female violinists performed 30-second random-ordered 
      slow and fast musical repertoire while right shoulder three-dimensional 
      kinematic, and upper trapezius and serratus anterior surface electromyography 
      (EMG) data were summarised using exposure variation analysis (EVA), a bivariate 
      distribution of work time spent at categories of signal amplitude, and duration 
      spent at a fixed category of amplitude. Sixty-two per cent of intraclass 
      correlation coefficients [1,1] for all kinematic and EMG variables exceeded 0.75, 
      and 40% of standard error of the measurement results were below 5%, confirming 
      EVA reliability. When fast repertoire was played, increases in odds ratios in 
      short duration cells were seen in 23 of 24 possible instances, and decreases in 
      longer duration cells were seen in 17 instances in all EVA arrays using 
      multinomial logistic regression with random effects, confirming a shift towards 
      shorter duration. A reliable technique to assess right shoulder kinematic and EMG 
      exposure in violinists was identified. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: A reliable method of 
      measuring right shoulder motion and muscle activity exposure variation in 
      violinists was developed which can be used to assess ergonomic risk in other 
      occupations. Recently developed statistical methods enabled differentiation 
      between fast and slow musical performance of standardised musical repertoire.

TI  - Scapular notching in reverse shoulder arthroplasty: validation of a computer 
      impingement model.
PG  - 278-83
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to validate a reverse shoulder computer 
      impingement model and quantify the impact of implant position on scapular 
      impingement by comparing it to that of a radiographic analysis of 256 patients 
      who received the same prosthesis and were followed postoperatively for an average 
      of 22.2 months. METHODS: A geometric computer analysis quantified anterior and 
      posterior scapular impingement as the humerus was internally and externally 
      rotated at varying levels of abduction and adduction relative to a fixed scapula 
      at defined glenoid implant positions. These impingement results were compared to 
      radiographic study of 256 patients who were analyzed for notching, glenoid 
      baseplate position, and glenosphere overhang. RESULTS: The computer model 
      predicted no impingement at 0° humeral abduction in the scapular plane for the 38 
      mm, 42 mm, and 46 mm devices when the glenoid baseplate cage peg is positioned 
      18.6 mm, 20.4 mm, and 22.7 mm from the inferior glenoid rim (of the reamed 
      glenoid) or when glenosphere overhang of 4.6 mm, 4.7 mm, and 4.5 mm was obtained 
      with each size glenosphere, respectively. When compared to the radiographic 
      analysis, the computer model correctly predicted impingement based upon glenoid 
      base- plate position in 18 of 26 patients with scapular notching and based upon 
      glenosphere overhang in 15 of 26 patients with scapular notching. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Reverse shoulder implant positioning plays an important role in scapular 
      notching. The results of this study demonstrate that the computer impingement 
      model can effectively predict impingement based upon implant positioning in a 
      majority of patients who developed scapular notching clinically. This computer 
      analysis provides guidance to surgeons on implant positions that reduce scapular 
      notching, a well-documented complication of reverse shoulder arthroplasty.

AB  - Gómez-Carmona, CD, Bastida-Castillo, A, González-Custodio, A, Olcina, G, and 
      Pino-Ortega, J. Using an inertial device (WIMU PRO) to quantify neuromuscular 
      load in running: reliability, convergent validity, and influence of type of 
      surface and device location. J Strength Cond Res 34(2): 365-373, 2020-Currently, 
      the use of accelerometers in sport is increasing, and thus, the devices are 
      required to be valid and reliable. This study tested (a) the reliability and 
      validity of WIMU PRO accelerometers to measure PlayerLoad (PL) and (b) the 
      influence of speed, inertial device location, and type of surface where the 
      incremental test is performed. Twenty resistance-trained men (age: 27.32 ± 6.65 
      years; height: 1.74 ± 0.03 m; body mass: 68.96 ± 4.37 kg; and body mass index: 
      22.76 ± 1.11 kg·m) volunteered to participate in the study that lasted 5 weeks. 
      Four progressive incremental tests were performed in treadmill and athletic track 
      conditions. External load variable (PL) and physiological variables (heart rate 
      [HR] and SmO2) were recorded by 4 WIMU PRO inertial devices (scapulae, center of 
      mass, knee, and ankle), a GARMIN HR band, and a MOXY near-infrared spectroscopy 
      device, respectively. High reliability was found on both types of surface, 
      showing the best values at the ankle (treadmill: intraclass correlation 
      coefficient [ICC] = 0.99, coefficient of variation [CV] = 4.65%; track: ICC = 
      0.96, CV = 6.54%). A nearly perfect convergent validity was shown with HRAVG (r = 
      0.99) and a moderate one with SmO2 (r = -0.69). Significant differences in the PL 
      variable between surfaces were reported in all locations except the scapulae (p = 
      0.173), and the higher values were found on the track. In the analysis per 
      location, the ankle location reported the highest values at all speeds and on the 
      2 surfaces analyzed. Assessment needs to be individualized, due to the great 
      variability of gait biomechanics among subjects. The accelerometer location 
      should be chosen according to the purpose of the measurement, with the ankle 
      location being recommended for neuromuscular load analysis in running.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate test and retest reliability according to examiner 
      experience with the three-dimensional kinematics of the trunk, scapula, and arm 
      segments during flexion and unilateral abduction of the arm. Ten men and 10 women 
      (mean age, 25.1 [1.1] years) participated in this study. Each volunteer 
      participated in six test sessions, four on the first day (two for each examiner) 
      and two on the second day (one for each examiner). A 48-h interval was given 
      between test days. The assessments were made by one examiner with movement 
      analysis experience and a second examiner without experience. For each session 
      (intra-day), the volunteers performed five repetitions of unilateral arm flexions 
      and abductions using their dominant arms. After 1 h, the data were re-collected 
      and all markers were replaced. Data from the trunk, scapula, and arm were 
      analysed at 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120° of arm flexion and abduction using intraclass 
      coefficient correlation, standard error of the measurement, and analysis of 
      variance. The results did not differ between the experienced and inexperienced 
      examiners except for trunk axial rotation at all studied angles and for arm 
      rotation at 120° of abduction. The examiner previously trained in movement 
      analysis marker placement demonstrated the same intra-tester reliability as the 
      inexperienced tester when marker placement accuracy was the variable of interest.

LID - 10.1016/j.math.2008.03.003 [doi]
AB  - Shoulder pain is a diagnostic challenge and the physical clinical examination of 
      the shoulder is crucial. It is important that the diagnostic tests used are valid 
      as well as reliable. The objective of the study was to assess intra- and 
      interexaminer reliability for four manual shoulder maneuvers; the Neer 
      impingement sign, the Hawkins-Kennedy impingement test, the Patte maneuver, the 
      Jobe supraspinatus test. These maneuvers are frequently used in clinical practice 
      to examine patients with shoulder complaints in which subacromial pain is highly 
      suspected. Thirty-three participants with shoulder pain were included 
      consecutively. Within a week from inclusion, the four maneuvers were performed by 
      a physiotherapist. The procedure was standardized in order to increase 
      reproducibility. After a week, the maneuvers were performed again by the same 
      physical therapist (test-retest) and by another physical therapist (test for 
      interexaminer reliability). All four maneuvers have an almost perfect agreement 
      (Kappa coefficients 0.91-1.00), if performed with suggested standardizations. 
      Neer impingement sign, Hawkins-Kennedy impingement test, Patte maneuver as well 
      as Jobe supraspinatus test, are highly reproducible and therefore reliable to use 
      in clinical practice to identify patients with subacromial pain with an 
      impingement phenomenon, but the maneuvers are limited as structural 
      discriminators.

      clinical practice due to their development over the last few years. We propose 
      the ELEPAP UL protocol, a contemporary UL kinematic protocol that can be applied 
      to different pathological conditions. This model is based on ISB modeling 
      recommendations, uses functional joint definitions, and models three joints of 
      the shoulder girdle. The specific aim of this study was to determine the within 
      and between session reliability of the ELEPAP UL model. Ten healthy subjects 
      (mean age: 13.6±4.3 years) performed four reach-to-grasp and five functional 
      tasks, which included a novel throwing task to assess a wide spectrum of motor 
      skills. Three trials of every task in two different sessions were analyzed. The 
      reliability of angular waveforms was evaluated by measurement error (σ) and 
      coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC). Spatiotemporal parameters were 
      assessed by standard error of measurement (SEM). Generally joint kinematics 
      presented low σw and σb errors (<100). A selection of angular waveforms errors 
      was presented to inspect error fluctuation in different phases, which was found 
      to be related to the demands of the different movements. CMCw and CMCb values 
      (>0.60) were found, demonstrating good to excellent reliability especially in 
      joints with larger ranges of motion. The throwing task proved equally reliable, 
      enhancing the universal application of the protocol. Compared to the literature, 
      this study demonstrated higher reliability of the thorax, scapula and wrist 
      joints. This was attributed to the highly standardized procedure and the 
      implementation of recent methodological advancements. In conclusion, ELEPAP 
      protocol was proved a reliable tool to analyze UL kinematics.

PG  - 150-62
AB  - The goal of this study was to measure 3-dimensional shoulder motion by use of a 
      direct invasive technique during 4 different arm movements in healthy volunteers. 
      Eight subjects with healthy shoulders were recruited. Optoelectronic marker 
      carriers (ie, infrared light-emitting diodes) were mounted on bone pins, which 
      were inserted into the lateral scapular spine. Subjects performed 4 different arm 
      movements while the motion was being recorded by a precision optoelectronic 
      camera. Joint angles were calculated in 3 dimensions. Intraclass correlation 
      coefficients and root-mean-square differences were calculated as measures of 
      reliability. During abduction, the scapula tipped posteriorly (44 degrees +/- 11 
      degrees), rotated upward (49 degrees +/- 7 degrees), and rotated externally (27 
      degrees +/- 11 degrees). For reaching, the scapula consistently rotated upward 
      (17 degrees +/- 3 degrees) and rotated internally (18 degrees +/- 6 degrees) 
      whereas tipping was generally less than 10 degrees (5 degrees +/- 2 degrees). 
      Overall, the range of scapular movement for the hand behind the back was small 
      and variable, with most rotations not exceeding 15 degrees. For horizontal 
      adduction, the scapula tipped anteriorly (8 degrees +/- 3 degrees), rotated 
      upward (5 degrees +/- 2 degrees), and rotated internally (27 degrees +/- 6 
      degrees). These scapular rotations provide normative data that will be useful for 
      diagnosing scapular dysfunction.

TI  - No relationship between critical shoulder angle and glenoid erosion after 
      shoulder hemiarthroplasty: a comparative radiographic study.
PG  - 919-923

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Symptomatic glenoid erosion is one of the most common causes of 
      functional impairment after shoulder hemiarthroplasty. A decrease in the critical 
      shoulder angle (CSA) has been associated with the development of shoulder 
      arthritis. The inter-observer reliability of the CSA and the relationship between 
      CSA and symptomatic glenoid erosion after shoulder hemiarthroplasty were 
      investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with symptomatic 
      glenoid erosion after anatomic hemiarthroplasty were compared to a control group 
      of 30 patients with no signs of symptomatic glenoid erosion. The CSA was measured 
      by two blinded shoulder surgeons at a mean follow-up of 105.2 and 54.7 months, 
      respectively. The inter-observer reliability was calculated. RESULTS: The mean 
      CSA in the control group in neutral, internal, and external rotations was 34°, 
      33°, and 33°, respectively. The corresponding values in the study group were 33°, 
      33°, and 33° (<0.01). The interclass correlation coefficient between the two 
      examiners was 0.917 (P < 0.01), 0.924 (P < 0.01), and 0.948 (P < 0.01), 
      respectively. The Mann-Whitney test between the control group and the study group 
      were, respectively, 0.907, 0.932, and 0.602. CONCLUSION: There were no 
      significant differences of CSA values between the two groups. Good inter-observer 
      reliability was found for the CSA method.

PG  - 1161-8

AB  - Conclusions about normal and pathologic shoulder motion are frequently made from 
      studies using skin surface markers, yet accuracy of such sensors representing 
      humeral motion is not well known. Nineteen subjects were investigated with flock 
      of birds electromagnetic sensors attached to transcortical pins placed into the 
      scapula and humerus, and a thermoplastic cuff secured on the arm. Subjects 
      completed two repetitions of raising and lowering the arm in the sagittal, 
      scapular and coronal planes, as well as shoulder internal and external rotation 
      with the elbow at the side and abducted to 90°. Humeral motion was recorded 
      simultaneously from surface and bone fixed sensors. The average magnitude of 
      error was calculated for the surface and bone fixed measurements throughout the 
      range of motion. ANOVA tested for differences across angles of elevation, raising 
      and lowering, and differences in body mass index. For all five motions tested, 
      the plane of elevation rotation average absolute error ranged from 0-2°, while 
      the humeral elevation rotation average error ranged from 0-4°. The axial rotation 
      average absolute error was much greater, ranging from 5° during elevation motions 
      to approaching 30° at maximum excursion of internal/external rotation motions. 
      Average absolute error was greater in subjects with body mass index greater than 
      25. Surface sensors are an accurate way of measuring humeral elevation rotations 
      and plane of elevation rotations. Conversely, there is a large amount of average 
      error for axial rotations when using a humeral cuff to measure glenohumeral 
      internal/external rotation as the primary motion.

AB  - It is suggested that scapular joint position sense (JPS) contributes to scapular 
      stability. However, there is a lack of studies describing the measurement method 
      for three-dimensional (3D) scapular JPS. The purposes of this study were to 
      investigate the measurement repeatability and validity of the scapular JPS, and 
      examine the effect of arm dominance on the scapular JPS in asymptomatic young 
      adults. Ten subjects participated in this study. The scapular JPS was measured as 
      scapular reposition errors during scapular elevation, depression, protraction, 
      and retraction. Both the 3D scapular kinematics and clinical scale rule 
      measurement were recorded during the test. The results showed that the 
      measurement of scapular reposition errors resulted in moderate to excellent 
      within-day intra-rater reliability with intraclass correlation coefficient 
      ICC(3,2) between 0.60 and 0.99 for 3D scapular rotations, between 0.56 and 0.96 
      for 3D scapular displacement, and between 0.73 and 0.98 for the clinical scale 
      ruler measurement. Scapular reposition errors measured using a 3D electromagnetic 
      tracking device and using a scale ruler had a significant relationship 
      (r=0.74-0.98). There was no significant difference in scapular reposition errors 
      between the dominant and non-dominant shoulders. Our findings indicated that both 
      the 3D tracking device and scale ruler resulted in a reliable measurement of 
      scapular JPS and the clinical measurement method could be used to provide valid 
      data for scapular JPS evaluation. In addition, arm dominance did not influence 
      the scapular JPS in asymptomatic young adults.

TI  - Interobserver reliability of physical examination of shoulder girdle.
PG  - 152-9
LID - 10.1016/j.math.2008.01.005 [doi]
AB  - The object of this study was to assess interobserver reliability in 23 tests 
      concerning physical examination of the shoulder girdle. A physical therapist and 
      a physical therapist/manual therapist independently performed a physical 
      examination of the shoulder girdle in 91 patients with shoulder complaints of 
      varying severity and duration. The observers assessed 23 items in total: active 
      and passive abductions, passive external rotation, hand in neck (HIN) test, hand 
      in back (HIB) test, impingement test according to Neer, springing test of the 
      first rib and joint play test of the acromioclavicular joint. The interobserver 
      reliability was evaluated by means of a Cohen's Kappa, the weighted Kappa and the 
      intraclass correlation (ICC). Criteria for acceptable reliability were: Kappa 
      value>or=0.60, ICC>or=0.75 or an absolute agreement>or=80%. The results showed 
      that Kappa values varied from 0.09 (springing test first rib, stiffness) to 0.66 
      (springing test first rib, pain), weighted Kappa varied from 0.35 (pain during 
      HIB) to 0.73 (range of motion HIB) and ICC varied from 0.54 (abduction passive 
      starting point painful arc) to 0.96 (active and passive ranges of motion in 
      abduction). In total 11 (48%) items fulfilled the criteria of acceptable 
      reliability. In conclusion, there appears to be a great deal of variation in the 
      reliability of the tests used in the physical examination of the shoulder girdle. 
      Over 50% of the tests did not meet the statistical criteria for acceptable 
      reliability.

TI  - Motion analysis study of a scapular orientation exercise and subjects' ability to 
      learn the exercise.
PG  - 13-8
AB  - Exercises to retrain the orientation of the scapula are often used by 
      physiotherapists to optimise shoulder girdle function. The movements and muscle 
      activity required to assume this position have not yet been quantified. Further, 
      patients often find this a difficult exercise to learn accurately, with no data 
      being available on the accuracy of repeated performance. The primary objective of 
      this study was to quantify the movements occurring during a commonly used 
      scapular orientation exercise. The secondary objective was to describe the 
      ability of subjects to learn this position after a brief period of instruction. A 
      group of normal subjects (13 subjects; mean age 32, SD=9) were taught the 
      scapular orientation exercise. Measurement of the position and muscle actions 
      were made with a motion analysis system and surface electromyography. Further 
      comparison was made of the accuracy of repeated trials. The most consistent 
      movements were upward (mean=4 degrees, SEM=0.9 degrees) and posterior rotation 
      (mean=4 degrees, SEM=1.6 degrees). All parts of the trapezius muscle demonstrated 
      significant activity in maintaining the position while latissimus dorsi did not. 
      Repeated trials showed that subjects were able to accurately repeat the movement 
      without guidance. The key movements of, and immediate efficacy of a teaching 
      approach for, scapular orientation have been established.

AB  - Electromagnetic devices allow the non invasive and accurate measurement of 3D 
      scapula kinematics. The acromial method allows continuous dynamic measurement 
      using a skin surface sensor fixed to the acromion. Inter-session intra and 
      inter-observer repeatability of 3D scapular kinematics have only been partially 
      assessed for analytical movements and never for functional tasks. Inter-session 
      intra and inter-observer repeatability of 3D scapular kinematics were assessed 
      for arm elevation in the sagittal and frontal planes and for two activities of 
      daily living (ADL), hair combing and back washing, in both shoulders of 15 
      healthy subjects, using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the 
      standard error of measurement (SEM), the small real difference (SRD) and the 
      Bland and Altman's graphical method. Intra-observer repeatability was good to 
      excellent for every scapular rotation for both arm elevation in isolated planes 
      and ADL (ICC ranged from 0.64 to 0.95). Inter-observer repeatability of scapular 
      rotations was fair to excellent for arm elevation in isolated planes (ICC ranged 
      from 0.49 to 0.92) and poor to excellent for ADL (ICC ranged from 0.35 to 0.89). 
      Inter-observer repeatability of scapular protraction/retraction had the lowest 
      ICC. For both inter-session intra and inter-observer reliability, the SEM and SRD 
      remained low and Bland and Altman's graphical method showed a good repeatability 
      of the measurement method. Longitudinal monitoring of a subject's scapular 
      kinematics by a trained observer is reliable. The inter-observer repeatability of 
      scapular protraction/retraction must be improved.

LID - 689610
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the correlation of abnormal trunk postures and reposition 
      sense of subjects with forward head neck posture (FHP). METHODS: In all, postures 
      of 41 subjects were evaluated and the FHP and trunk posture including shoulder, 
      scapular level, pelvic side, and anterior tilting degrees were analyzed. We used 
      the head repositioning accuracy (HRA) test to evaluate neck position senses of 
      neck flexion, neck extension, neck right and left side flexion, and neck right 
      and left rotation and calculated the root mean square error in trials for each 
      subject. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and regression analysis were 
      used to assess the degree of correlation between the trunk posture and HRA value, 
      and a significance level of α = 0.05 was considered. RESULTS: There were 
      significant correlations between the HRA value of right side neck flexion and 
      pelvic side tilt angle (p < 0.05). If pelvic side tilting angle increases by 1 
      degree, right side neck flexion increased by 0.76 degrees (p = 0.026). However, 
      there were no significant correlations between other neck motions and trunk 
      postures. CONCLUSION: Verifying pelvic postures should be prioritized when 
      movement is limited due to the vitiation of the proprioceptive sense of neck 
      caused by FHP.

TI  - Acromioclavicular joint pain in patients with adhesive capsulitis: a prospective 
      outcome study.
PG  - e556-60
LID - 10.3928/01477447-20110714-05 [doi]
AB  - Diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis is a clinical diagnosis based on history and 
      physical examination. Afflicted patients exhibit active and passive loss of 
      motion in all planes and a positive capsular stretch sign. The effect of adhesive 
      capsulitis on acromioclavicular biomechanics leading to tenderness has not been 
      documented in the literature. This study reports on the incidence of 
      acromioclavicular tenderness in the presence of adhesive capsulitis. Furthermore, 
      we note the natural history of such acromioclavicular joint pain in relation to 
      that of adhesive capsulitis. Over a 2-year period (2005-2007), 84 patients 
      undergoing initial evaluation for adhesive capsulitis were prospectively examined 
      with the use of validated outcome measures and physical examination. 
      Acromioclavicular joint tenderness results were compared and analyzed on initial 
      evaluation and final follow-up of at least 1 year. Forty-eight patients (57%) 
      with adhesive capsulitis had acromioclavicular joint pain on examination. At 
      final follow-up, as range of motion improved, a significant increase in American 
      Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons/Penn shoulder score and decrease in number of 
      patients with acromioclavicular pain was noted with only 6 patients with residual 
      pain (P<.05). In the presence of adhesive capsulitis, there is not only 
      compensatory scapulothoracic motion but also acromioclavicular motion. This often 
      results in transient symptoms at the acromioclavicular joint, which abate as the 
      frozen shoulder resolves and glenohumeral motion improves. This is important to 
      recognize to avoid unnecessary invasive treatment of the acromioclavicular joint 
      when the patient presents with adhesive capsulitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) scans of the shoulder are often not well 
      aligned to the axis of the scapula and glenoid. The purpose of this paper was to 
      determine the effect of sagittal rotation of the glenoid on axial measurements of 
      anterior-posterior (AP) glenoid width and glenoid version attained by standard CT 
      scan. In addition, we sought to define the angle of rotation required to correct 
      the CT scan to optimal positioning. METHODS: A total of 30 CT scans of the 
      shoulder were reformatted using OsiriX software multiplanar reconstruction. The 
      uncorrected (UNCORR) and corrected (CORR) CT scans were compared for measurements 
      of both (1) axial AP glenoid width and (2) glenoid version at 5 standardized 
      axial cuts. RESULTS: The mean difference in glenoid version was 2.6% (2° ± 0.1°; 
      P = .0222) and the mean difference in AP glenoid width was 5.2% (1.2 ± 0.42 mm; P 
      = .0026) in comparing the CORR and UNCORR scans. The mean angle of correction 
      required to align the sagittal plane was 20.1° of rotation (range, 9°-39°; 
      standard error of mean, 1.2°). CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that UNCORR 
      CT scans of the glenohumeral joint do not correct for the sagittal rotation of 
      the glenoid, and this affects the characteristics of the axial images. Failure to 
      align the sagittal image to the 12-o'clock to 6-o'clock axis results in 
      measurement error in both glenoid version and AP glenoid width. Use of UNCORR CT 
      images may have notable implications for decision-making and surgical treatment.

AB  - PURPOSES: To evaluate the feasibility of using the single-joint Hybrid Assistive 
      Limb(®) robot (HAL) to assist with shoulder flexion-extension in healthy adults, 
      and to assess the capacity of the HAL to analyze the bioelectrical signals of 
      muscle activity for shoulder flexion-extension. METHODS: This cross-sectional 
      feasibility study included six healthy adult men with no impairment in shoulder 
      motion. The single-joint HAL was fixed to a custom-designed platform and upper 
      arm attachment, and aligned 3 cm below the acromion process. Vital signs, 
      shoulder fatigue, and shoulder pain were evaluated before and after the shoulder 
      elevation exercise performed with and without the HAL. Activity of selected 
      muscles of the shoulder was recorded using a wireless superficial 
      electromyography device. Shoulder movement was captured using a three-dimensional 
      motion analysis system. RESULTS: The HAL supported smooth flexion-extension of 
      the arm at the shoulder joint, with no negative effects on vital signs, shoulder 
      fatigue, and shoulder pain. The HAL decreased muscle activity levels, with a 55% 
      decrease in trapezius muscle activity. The upward rotation angle of the scapula 
      was significantly lower with the HAL at 120° of shoulder flexion. CONCLUSION: The 
      single-joint HAL provided safe and effective assistance to scapular plane 
      shoulder flexion-extension among healthy adults.

TI  - A Clinical Evaluation of Scapular Dyskinesis Among Professional Bus Drivers With 
      Unilateral Upper Quadrant Musculoskeletal Pain.
PG  - 460-466

AB  - BACKGROUND: Professional bus drivers report a high prevalence of upper quadrant 
      musculoskeletal pain which could be associated with scapular dyskinesis (SD). 
      However, the evidence for valid and reliable screening methods for this condition 
      is limited as SD among bus drivers is an emerging area of research. Therefore, 
      the main aim of the study was to investigate the reliability of dynamic scapular 
      motion test (DSMT) using video analysis as an accurate method to evaluate SD and 
      to identify patterns of SD among bus drivers. METHODS: In total, 32 bus drivers 
      from a private bus company with unilateral upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain 
      participated in the study. The DSMT was conducted and the SD was captured in the 
      video during shoulder flexion-abduction movements. Two investigators analyzed the 
      video recordings and identified the patterns of SD. The intra- and interrater 
      reliability were determined using the percentage of agreement and weighted Kappa 
      coefficients (Kw). Descriptive analysis was used to examine the patterns of SD. 
      FINDINGS: The intra- and interrater reliability of DSMT using video analysis were 
      excellent (Kw coefficient: 0.762-0.878 and 0.87-1.00, respectively). About 56.2% 
      and 53.1% of bus drivers presented SD with the shoulder flexion and abduction 
      movements during DSMT. Medial border prominence (Type II pattern of SD) was 
      identified as the common pattern of SD. CONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: The 
      DSMT using video analysis showed excellent intra- and interrater reliability to 
      evaluate SD. Occupational health practitioners can consider DSMT using video 
      analysis to identify SD among people with upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain at 
      the workplace.

AB  - Kinematics of the shoulder girdle obtained from non-invasive measurement systems 
      such as video motion analysis, accelerometers and magnetic tracking sensors has 
      been shown to be adversely affected by instrumentation measurement errors and 
      skin motion artefact. The degree to which musculoskeletal model calculations of 
      shoulder muscle and joint loading are influenced by variations in joint 
      kinematics is currently not well understood. A three-dimensional musculoskeletal 
      model of the upper limb was used to evaluate the sensitivity of shoulder muscle 
      and joint force. Monte-Carlo analyses were performed by randomly perturbing 
      scapular and humeral joint coordinates during abduction and flexion. Muscle and 
      joint force calculations were generally most sensitive to changes in the 
      kinematics of the humerus in elevation and of the scapula in medial-lateral 
      rotation, and were least sensitive to changes in humerus plane of elevation and 
      scapula protraction-retraction. Overall model sensitivity was greater during 
      abduction than flexion, and the influence of specific kinematics perturbations 
      varied from muscle to muscle. In general, muscles that generated greater force, 
      such as the middle deltoid and subscapularis, were more sensitive to changes in 
      shoulder kinematics. This study suggests that musculoskeletal model sensitivity 
      to changes in kinematics is task-specific, and varies depending on the plane of 
      motion. Calculations of shoulder muscle and joint function depend on reliable 
      humeral and scapula motion data, particularly that of humeral elevation and 
      scapula medial-lateral rotation. The findings in this study have implications for 
      the use of kinematic data in musculoskeletal model development and simulations.

AB  - Measuring the motion of the scapula and humerus with sub-millimeter levels of 
      accuracy in six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) is a challenging problem. The current 
      methods to measure shoulder joint motion via the skin do not produce clinically 
      significant levels of accuracy. Thus, the purpose of this study was to validate a 
      non-invasive markerless dual fluoroscopic imaging system (DFIS) model-based 
      tracking technique for measuring dynamic in-vivo shoulder kinematics. Our DFIS 
      tracks the positions of bones based on their projected silhouettes to contours on 
      recorded pairs of fluoroscopic images. For this study, we compared markerlessly 
      tracking the bones of the scapula and humerus to track them with implanted 
      titanium spheres using a radiostereometric analysis (RSA) while manually 
      manipulating a cadaver specimen's arms. Additionally, we report the repeatability 
      of the DFIS to track the scapula and humerus during dynamic shoulder motion. The 
      difference between the markerless model-based tracking technique and the RSA was 
      ±0.3 mm in translation and ±0.5° in rotation. Furthermore, the repeatability of 
      the markerless DFIS model-based tracking technique for the scapula and humerus 
      was ±0.2 mm and ±0.4°, respectively. The model-based tracking technique achieves 
      an accuracy that is similar to an invasive RSA tracking technique and is highly 
      suited for non-invasively studying the in-vivo motion of the shoulder. This 
      technique could be used to investigate the scapular and humeral biomechanics in 
      both healthy individuals and in patients with various pathologies under a variety 
      of dynamic shoulder motions encountered during the activities of daily living.

AB  - Adhesive capsulitis (AC) is a glenohumeral (GH) joint condition, characterized by 
      decreased GH joint range of motion (ROM) and compensatory ROM in the elbow and 
      scapulothoracic (ST) joint. To evaluate AC progression in clinical settings, 
      objective movement analysis by available systems would be valuable. This study 
      aimed to assess within-session and intra- and inter-operator 
      reliability/agreement of such a motion capture system. The MVN-Awinda® system 
      from Xsens Technologies (Enschede, The Netherlands) was used to assess ST, GH, 
      and elbow ROM during four tasks (GH external rotation, combing hair, grasping a 
      seatbelt, placing a cup on a shelf) in 10 AC patients (mean age = 54 (± 6), 7 
      females), on two test occasions (accompanied by different operators on second 
      occasion). Standard error of measurements (SEMs) were below 1.5° for ST 
      pro-retraction and 4.6° for GH in-external rotation during GH external rotation; 
      below 6.6° for ST tilt, 6.4° for GH flexion-extension, 7.1° for elbow 
      flexion-extension during combing hair; below 4.4° for GH ab-adduction, 13° for GH 
      in-external rotation, 6.8° for elbow flexion-extension during grasping the 
      seatbelt; below 11° for all ST and GH joint rotations during placing a cup on a 
      shelf. Therefore, to evaluate AC progression, inertial sensors systems can be 
      applied during the execution of functional tasks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint is one of the most common 
      shoulder problems in general orthopaedic practice. The question of whether 
      surgery should be used remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative 
      effects of surgical versus conservative (non-surgical) interventions for treating 
      acromioclavicular dislocations in adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the 
      Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to February 
      2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 
      2009, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2009), EMBASE (1988 to February 2009), 
      and LILACS (1982 to February 2009), trial registries and reference lists of 
      articles. There were no restrictions based on language or publication status. 
      SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared 
      surgical with conservative treatment of acromioclavicular dislocation in adults 
      were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All review authors independently 
      performed study selection. Two authors independently assessed the included trials 
      and performed data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials were included in this 
      review. These involved a total of 174 mainly male participants. Two trials were 
      randomised and one was quasi-randomised. None used validated measures for 
      assessing functional outcome.Fixation of the acromioclavicular joint using 
      coracoclavicular screws, acromioclavicular pins or, usually threaded, wires was 
      compared with supporting the arm in a sling or similar device. There were no 
      significant differences between the two groups in unsatisfactory longer-term (one 
      year) shoulder function based on a composite measure including pain, movement and 
      strength or function (risk ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 0.75 to 2.95), nor 
      in treatment failure that generally required an operation (risk ratio 1.72, 95% 
      confidence interval 0.72 to 4.12). However, there were fixation failures in all 
      three trials. Particularly, the trial using wires reported a high incidence of 
      wire breakage (16/39 (41%)). Two trials reported that surgery significantly 
      delayed the return to work. The methods used in the three trials also meant a 
      routine second operation for implant removal was necessary. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: 
      There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine 
      when surgical treatment is indicated for acromioclavicular dislocation in adults 
      in current practice. Sufficiently powered, good quality, well-reported randomised 
      trials of currently-used surgical interventions versus conservative treatment for 
      well-defined injuries are required.

TI  - Management of an engaging Hill-Sachs lesion: arthroscopic remplissage with 
      Bankart repair versus Latarjet procedure.
PG  - 3793-3800
AB  - PURPOSE: This study compared the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic remplissage 
      with Bankart repair and Latarjet operation in patients with a large engaging 
      Hill-Sachs lesion. METHODS: Thirty-seven shoulders subjected to arthroscopic 
      remplissage with a Bankart repair (group A) and 35 shoulders subjected to a 
      Latarjet operation (group B), for a large engaging Hill-Sachs lesion without 
      significant glenoid bone loss, were retrospectively evaluated. Each group was 
      followed up for a mean more than 2-year period. RESULTS: At the last follow-up, 
      postoperative pain, shoulder mobility, muscle strength, Rowe score, and UCLA 
      score revealed no significant difference between the two groups. The 
      postoperative mean deficit in external rotation at the side (ERs) was 8° ± 23° in 
      group A (P = 0.044). In group B, the mean deficits in ERs, external rotation at 
      90° of abduction, and internal rotation to the posterior were 10° ± 20°, 
      7° ± 16°, and 1.9° ± 4°, respectively (P = 0.004, 0.022, and 0.009, 
      respectively). The recurrence rate was 5.4 % (two shoulders) in group A and 5.7 % 
      (two shoulders) in group B (n.s.). The overall complication rate was 
      significantly higher in group B (14.3 %) than in group A (0 %) (P = 0.017). 
      CONCLUSIONS: For recurrent anterior shoulder instability with a large engaging 
      Hill-Sachs lesion, both arthroscopic remplissage with Bankart repair and the 
      Latarjet procedure were safe and reliable techniques with a low recurrence rate. 
      However, the Latarjet group had a significantly higher postoperative complication 
      rate than the remplissage group. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Case-control study, Level 
      III.

AB  - Scapular kinematics during sports performances can be recorded using skin-mounted 
      trackers attached to the skin overlying the acromion for continuous data 
      collection without restricting natural motions of the subject relative to medical 
      imaging analyses limiting its use for wide-range or high-speed motions. This 
      study aimed to describe the existence of a directional bias in the translational 
      and rotational errors of skin-mounted trackers using a 3D magnetic resonance 
      imaging (3D-MRI) protocol. 3D-MRI scans of the healthy right shoulders of 19 
      males were acquired in 12 arm positions. The relative transformation of the 
      scapular configuration determined to be the measurement error, as recorded by the 
      configuration of the small cuboid imitating a skin-mounted tracker relative to 
      the actual scapular configuration measured by the voxel-based registration. These 
      measurement errors were expressed with either positive or negative values to 
      describe the bias. Overall translational errors in the lateral, anterior, and 
      superior directions were 3.7 ± 8.4 mm, 9.5 ± 6.4 mm, and 6.2 ± 4.6 mm, 
      respectively. Overall rotational errors in protraction, upward rotation, and 
      posterior tilt were 7.8 ± 8.4°, 0.2 ± 7.4°, and - 4.0 ± 7.5°, respectively. The 
      skin-mounted tracker displayed a high probability of displacement in 
      antero-superior (93% and 91%) directions and rotates in a protracting manner 
      (82%) relative to the position of the underlying bone with the gradual nature of 
      its change. The existence of the directional bias with its gradual change 
      suggests a statistical predictability in measurement errors, which can be used to 
      predict accurate scapular translation and rotation.

TI  - Three-dimensional assessment of the asymptomatic and post-stroke shoulder: 
      intra-rater test-retest reliability and within-subject repeatability of the 
      palpation and digitization approach.
PG  - 1826-1834
LID - 10.1080/09638288.2018.1451924 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Altered three-dimensional (3D) joint kinematics can contribute to 
      shoulder pathology, including post-stroke shoulder pain. Reliable assessment 
      methods enable comparative studies between asymptomatic shoulders of healthy 
      subjects and painful shoulders of post-stroke subjects, and could inform 
      treatment planning for post-stroke shoulder pain. The study purpose was to 
      establish intra-rater test-retest reliability and within-subject repeatability of 
      a palpation/digitization protocol, which assesses 3D clavicular/scapular/humeral 
      rotations, in asymptomatic and painful post-stroke shoulders. Methods: Repeated 
      measurements of 3D clavicular/scapular/humeral joint/segment rotations were 
      obtained using palpation/digitization in 32 asymptomatic and six painful 
      post-stroke shoulders during four reaching postures 
      (rest/flexion/abduction/external rotation). Intra-class correlation coefficients 
      (ICCs), standard error of the measurement and 95% confidence intervals were 
      calculated. Results: All ICC values indicated high to very high test-retest 
      reliability (≥0.70), with lower reliability for scapular anterior/posterior tilt 
      during external rotation in asymptomatic subjects, and scapular medial/lateral 
      rotation, humeral horizontal abduction/adduction and axial rotation during 
      abduction in post-stroke subjects. All standard error of measurement values 
      demonstrated within-subject repeatability error ≤5° for all 
      clavicular/scapular/humeral joint/segment rotations (asymptomatic ≤3.75°; 
      post-stroke ≤5.0°), except for humeral axial rotation (asymptomatic ≤5°; 
      post-stroke ≤15°). Conclusions: This noninvasive, clinically feasible 
      palpation/digitization protocol was reliable and repeatable in asymptomatic 
      shoulders, and in a smaller sample of painful post-stroke shoulders. Implications 
      for Rehabilitation In the clinical setting, a reliable and repeatable noninvasive 
      method for assessment of three-dimensional (3D) clavicular/scapular/humeral joint 
      orientation and range of motion (ROM) is currently required. The established 
      reliability and repeatability of this proposed palpation/digitization protocol 
      will enable comparative 3D ROM studies between asymptomatic and post-stroke 
      shoulders, which will further inform treatment planning. Intra-rater test-retest 
      repeatability, which is measured by the standard error of the measure, indicates 
      the range of error associated with a single test measure. Therefore, clinicians 
      can use the standard error of the measure to determine the "true" differences 
      between pre-treatment and post-treatment test scores.

TI  - Does scapular corrective taping alter periscapular muscle activity and 
      3-dimensional scapular kinematics? A systematic review.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This is a systematic review. INTRODUCTION: Scapular taping is 
      widely used in the management of scapular dysfunction. However, its effects on 
      the scapular kinematics and the electromyography (EMG) activity of the 
      periscapular muscles are not clear. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of the 
      study was to systematically review the current literature to examine whether 
      scapular corrective taping alters the EMG activity of the periscapular muscles 
      and the 3-dimensional scapular kinematics. METHOD: MEDLINE and Web of Science 
      databases were searched using specific mesh terms up to April 2018. A hand search 
      was also conducted on the reference list of the included articles. A total of 157 
      studies were identified, and they were further analyzed for the eligibility to 
      the systematic review. Studies that investigated the effects of scapular 
      corrective taping on the EMG activity of the periscapular muscles and on the 
      3-dimensional scapular kinematics on patients with shoulder problems or 
      asymptomatic subjects were eligible for the systematic review. The Cochrane 
      Effective Practice and Organization of Care criteria were modified and used for 
      the risk-of-bias assessment. RESULTS: Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria 
      and were included in the systematic review. Five studies investigated the effects 
      of corrective taping on the scapular kinematics and 8 studies reported the 
      effects of corrective taping on the EMG activity of the periscapular muscles. 
      There was an agreement among the studies that scapular upward rotation is 
      increased with the corrective taping, while there are inconsistent results 
      concerning the scapular external rotation and posterior tilt. In addition, 
      studies mostly reported that corrective taping decreases the activity of the 
      upper trapezius, while it has conflicting effects on the activity patterns of 
      other periscapular muscles. DISCUSSION: Scapular corrective taping was found to 
      increase the scapular upward rotation; however, its effects on scapular external 
      rotation and posterior tilt are controversial. It was also found that corrective 
      taping might decrease the EMG activity of the upper trapezius, while it had no 
      effects on the activity of lower trapezius, and its effects on other periscapular 
      muscles were controversial. CONCLUSION: The results of the studies indicated that 
      scapular corrective taping might alter the 3-dimensional scapular kinematics, 
      while there are controversies about the effects of corrective taping on the EMG 
      activity of the periscapular muscles. Further studies are needed to clarify the 
      conflicts.

TI  - Measurement of scapula upward rotation: a reliable clinical procedure.
PG  - 599-603
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is important to deal with the scapula when developing 
      rehabilitation strategies for the shoulder complex. This requires clinical 
      measurement tools that are readily available and easy to apply and which provide 
      a reliable evaluation of scapula motion. AIM: To determine the reliability of the 
      Plurimeter-V gravity inclinometer for the measurement of scapular upward rotation 
      positions during humeral elevation in coronal abduction in a group of patients 
      with shoulder pathology. METHOD: Twenty six patients were assessed in two repeat 
      tests within a single testing session. Patients exhibiting a wide spectrum of 
      shoulder pathology were selected. The angle of scapular upward rotation was 
      measured during total shoulder abduction. The measurement protocol was performed 
      twice during a single testing session by a single tester. Results of the two 
      tests were compared and the reliability assessed by intraclass correlation 
      coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the scapula 
      measurements taken during the two tests at each testing position. Overall, there 
      was very good intrarater reliability (ICC = 0.88). The ICC ranged from 0.81 (at 
      135 degrees) to 0.94 (at both resting and end of total shoulder abduction range). 
      CONCLUSION: The Plurimeter-V gravity inclinometer can be used effectively and 
      reliably for measuring upward rotation of the scapula in all ranges of shoulder 
      abduction in the coronal plane.

TI  - Results of an open posterior bone block procedure for recurrent posterior 
      shoulder instability after a short- and long-time follow-up.
PG  - 618-24

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to analyse and compare the clinical and 
      radiological results after open posterior bone block procedure at long- (LT) and 
      short-term (ST) follow-up. The hypothesis was that placement of a bone block at 
      the posterior glenoid rim in a technique of extending the glenoid surface will 
      create permanent joint stability even in cases with hyperlaxity without a 
      clinically relevant loss of motion or increase in osteoarthritis. METHODS: 
      Fifteen consecutive shoulders with recurrent posterior dislocation were evaluated 
      clinically and radiologically. The Rowe score, Western Ontario Shoulder Index, 
      Walch-Duplay score and the Constant-Murley score were used for clinical 
      evaluation. The patients were categorized according to their follow-up period as 
      either ST follow-up (min 12 months) or LT follow-up (min 42 months). RESULTS: The 
      clinical results showed no significant difference between ST (9) and LT (6) with 
      good to very good overall results in the subjective as well as the objective 
      scores (CS, RS, WDS). At LT, most patients felt mild to minor pain under strain. 
      The difference in pain between the groups was not significant. Active ranges of 
      motion and strength assessments were normal in all cases. In one case, recurrent 
      dislocations occurred after bone graft resorption 6 months post-operatively. Only 
      one patient presented mild osteoarthritis, without further progress at follow-up. 
      CONCLUSION: The open posterior bone block procedure can be a successful treatment 
      option for recurrent posterior shoulder instability at ST and LT follow-up. This 
      series showed a low rate of recurrent dislocations without development or 
      progression of osteoarthritis. Since soft tissue procedures do not always provide 
      satisfying results, the posterior bone block augmentation presents a reliable 
      technique for the treatment of symptomatic posterior instability. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Case Series, Treatment Study, Level IV.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: In this study, we aim to test whether scapular winging results in a 
      significant change in glenohumeral translation in the initial phase of the 
      throwing motion. METHODS: Six shoulders underwent an abbreviated throwing motion 
      (ATM) from late cocking to the end of acceleration by use of a validated robotic 
      system. The intact specimens were tested to establish a baseline. The position of 
      the scapula was then affected to simulate scapular winging by placing a 
      cylindrical wedge under the inferior angle of the scapula, and the ATM was 
      performed again. For both conditions, the average glenohumeral translations and 
      scapular rotations were plotted over time to calculate the area under the curve, 
      as a representative of the overall glenohumeral translations and scapular 
      rotations observed during the ATM. RESULTS: Throughout the motion, the winged 
      scapulae showed, on average, 7.7° more upward rotation, 1.6° more internal 
      rotation, and 5.3° more anterior tipping as compared with the baseline. The 
      scapular position relative to the hanging arm was significantly different between 
      the baseline and scapular winging conditions in all arm positions, except for 
      maximal external rotation and the neutral position. Comparing the area under the 
      curve at baseline and with scapular winging indicated that scapular winging 
      significantly increased anterior translation of the glenohumeral joint whereas 
      translation in the superior/inferior and medial/lateral directions did not result 
      in a change in translation. DISCUSSION: These results may suggest a more 
      important role of abnormalities in scapular position in predisposing throwing 
      athletes to shoulder injuries of the anterior capsulolabral structures and 
      consecutive glenohumeral instability.

TI  - [Instability pattern of acromioclavicular joint dislocations type Rockwood III: 
      relevance of horizontal instability].
PG  - 271-7
LID - 10.1007/s00132-013-2085-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no evidence-based treatment algorithm established for 
      acromioclavicular joint (AC joint) dislocation classified as type Rockwood III 
      injury. Recent meta-analyses revealed no advantage of surgical treatment compared 
      to the non-operative approach. Both surgical and non-surgical approaches have 
      been reported with inconsistent results. Therefore, the hypothesis of the current 
      study was that patients classified as having Rockwood grade III injury may have 
      different degrees of horizontal AC joint instability. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 
      total of 18 consecutive patients who had sustained a dislocation of the AC joint 
      classified as Rockwood III were evaluated radiologically to quantify the 
      horizontal instability of the AC joint. The specific radiological investigation 
      included lateral stress x-rays (Alexander view) und axial stress x-rays with the 
      affected arm in a horizontal adduction position. RESULTS: The dynamic horizontal 
      instability of the AC joint was found to be independent of the vertical 
      dislocation measured in the Rockwood classification. CONCLUSION: For further 
      treatment studies Rockwood III injuries should be distinguished in patients 
      presenting with or without a substantial horizontal AC joint instability.

TI  - Intermethod agreement and interobserver correlation of radiologic acromiohumeral 
      distance measurements.
PG  - 237-40
AB  - The acromiohumeral distance (AHD) measured on conventional, true anteroposterior 
      radiographs taken with the patient standing and the arm held in neutral rotation 
      can predict the presence or absence of a large, chronic rotator cuff tears, and 
      narrowing of the acromiohumeral distance can predict irreparability of rotator 
      cuff tears. The relation between AHD measured on conventional radiographs and the 
      integrity of the rotator cuff tendons is well known. Conversely, the correlation 
      between the AHD on conventional radiographs and that measured on magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans is unknown. It has also 
      not been determined which method correlates better with fatty infiltration of the 
      rotator cuff muscles and might thereby be a better prognostic value for the 
      outcome of rotator cuff repair. Conventional radiographs, plus MRI and or CT 
      studies taken at the same time of patients with rotator cuff tears, shoulder 
      instability, primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis, or idiopathic frozen shoulder, 
      were randomly selected, and the AHD was measured both on conventional radiographs 
      and on MRI or CT. The values were correlated with the stage of fatty degeneration 
      of the rotator cuff muscles in the cases of rotator cuff tears. The AHD on 
      conventional radiographs was larger than on MRI and CT, and correlation of the 
      values measured (conventional radiography vs MRI and CT) could be demonstrated. 
      For rotator cuff diseases, a significant but moderate correlation (r = 0.6; P < 
      .05) between conventional and MRI was identified, and the conventional values 
      were approximately 0.6 mm greater than the corresponding MRI values. It is, 
      therefore, possible to use the AHD read on MRI or CT studies for prognostic 
      reasons, provided the values obtained are converted accordingly and remembering 
      that the correlation of the values is only moderate.

      minimize skin movement artifact.
PG  - e51717
LID - 10.3791/51717 [doi]
LID - 51717
AB  - The measurement of dynamic scapular kinematics is complex due to the sliding 
      nature of the scapula beneath the skin surface. The aim of the study was to 
      clearly describe the acromion marker cluster (AMC) method of determining scapular 
      kinematics when using a passive marker motion capture system, with consideration 
      for the sources of error which could affect the validity and reliability of 
      measurements. The AMC method involves placing a cluster of markers over the 
      posterior acromion, and through calibration of anatomical landmarks with respect 
      to the marker cluster it is possible to obtain valid measurements of scapular 
      kinematics. The reliability of the method was examined between two days in a 
      group of 15 healthy individuals (aged 19-38 years, eight males) as they performed 
      arm elevation, to 120°, and lowering in the frontal, scapular and sagittal 
      planes. Results showed that between-day reliability was good for upward scapular 
      rotation (Coefficient of Multiple Correlation; CMC = 0.92) and posterior tilt 
      (CMC = 0.70) but fair for internal rotation (CMC = 0.53) during the arm elevation 
      phase. The waveform error was lower for upward rotation (2.7° to 4.4°) and 
      posterior tilt (1.3° to 2.8°), compared to internal rotation (5.4° to 7.3°). The 
      reliability during the lowering phase was comparable to results observed during 
      the elevation phase. If the protocol outlined in this study is adhered to, the 
      AMC provides a reliable measurement of upward rotation and posterior tilt during 
      the elevation and lowering phases of arm movement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glenohumeral instability is a common problem following traumatic 
      anterior shoulder dislocation. Two major risk factors of recurrent instability 
      are glenoid and Hill-Sachs bone loss. Higher failure rates of arthroscopic 
      Bankart repairs are associated with larger degrees of bone loss; therefore it is 
      important to accurately and reliably quantify glenohumeral bone loss 
      pre-operatively. This may be done with radiography, CT, or MRI; however no gold 
      standard modality or method has been determined. A scoping review of the 
      literature was performed to identify imaging methods for quantifying glenohumeral 
      bone loss. METHODS: The scoping review was systematic in approach using a 
      comprehensive search strategy and standardized study selection and evaluation. 
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched. Initial selection 
      included articles from January 2000 until July 2013, and was based on the review 
      of titles and abstracts. Articles were carried forward if either reviewer thought 
      that the study was appropriate. Final study selection was based on full text 
      review based on pre-specified criteria. Consensus was reached for final article 
      inclusion through discussion amongst the investigators. One reviewer extracted 
      data while a second reviewer independently assessed data extraction for 
      discrepancies. RESULTS: Forty-one studies evaluating glenoid and/or Hill-Sachs 
      bone loss were included: 32 studies evaluated glenoid bone loss while 11 studies 
      evaluated humeral head bone loss. Radiography was useful as a screening tool but 
      not to quantify glenoid bone loss. CT was most accurate but necessitates 
      radiation exposure. The Pico Method and Glenoid Index method were the most 
      accurate and reliable methods for quantifying glenoid bone loss, particularly 
      when using three-dimensional CT (3DCT). Radiography and CT have been used to 
      quantify Hill-Sachs bone loss, but have not been studied as extensively as 
      glenoid bone loss. CONCLUSIONS: Radiography can be used for screening patients 
      for significant glenoid bone loss. CT imaging, using the Glenoid Index or Pico 
      Method, has good evidence for accurate quantification of glenoid bone loss. There 
      is limited evidence to guide imaging of Hill-Sachs bone loss. As a consensus has 
      not been reached, further study will help to clarify the best imaging modality 
      and method for quantifying glenohumeral bone loss.

TI  - Shoulder impingement: relationship of clinical symptoms and imaging criteria.
PG  - 83-9
LID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e318198e2e3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish, in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome, (1) 
      the relationship between pain and shoulder function, as determined by the 
      Constant score, and morphological findings, as determined by radiographs and 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and (2) the relationship between acromial shape 
      and minimum acromiohumeral distance (AHD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. 
      SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Forty-seven patients (33 males and 14 
      females; mean age, 51.7 years) with unilateral subacromial impingement syndrome 
      who had failed to respond to conservative therapy for at least 6 months. 
      INTERVENTIONS: The Constant score was determined preoperatively; acromial shape 
      (type I, flat; type II, curved; and type III, hooked) was evaluated on 
      preoperative outlet view radiographs and oblique sagittal T1-weighted MRIs; AHD 
      was evaluated on preoperative anteroposterior radiographs and oblique coronal 
      T1-weighted MRIs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Correlation coefficients and the simple 
      kappa statistic were calculated. Student t test and mean differences with 95% 
      confidence limits were reported for group comparisons. RESULTS: The Constant 
      score was fairly correlated with AHD (r = 0.39, P < 0.01) but not with acromial 
      shape. Patients with an AHD < or =7 mm on MRI scored significantly lower than 
      those with an AHD >7 (mean difference, 18.5; P < 0.01). Acromial shape and AHD 
      were not correlated, neither on radiographs nor on MRI. CONCLUSIONS: AHD seems to 
      better reflect the clinical status of patients with subacromial impingement, but 
      without rotator cuff tears, than acromial shape. Acromial shape is not a good 
      descriptor of subacromial space narrowing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-specific performance assessment of arm movements in daily 
      life activities is fundamental for neurological rehabilitation therapy. In most 
      applications, the shoulder movement is simplified through a socket-ball joint, 
      neglecting the movement of the scapular-thoracic complex. This may lead to 
      significant errors. We propose an innovative bi-articular model of the human 
      shoulder for estimating the position of the hand in relation to the sternum. The 
      model takes into account both the scapular-toracic and gleno-humeral movements 
      and their ratio governed by the scapular-humeral rhythm, fusing the information 
      of inertial and textile-based strain sensors. METHOD: To feed the reconstruction 
      algorithm based on the bi-articular model, an ad-hoc sensing shirt was developed. 
      The shirt was equipped with two inertial measurement units (IMUs) and an 
      integrated textile strain sensor. We built the bi-articular model starting from 
      the data obtained in two planar movements (arm abduction and flexion in the 
      sagittal plane) and analysing the error between the reference data - measured 
      through an optical reference system - and the socket-ball approximation of the 
      shoulder. The 3D model was developed by extending the behaviour of the kinematic 
      chain revealed in the planar trajectories through a parameter identification that 
      takes into account the body structure of the subject. RESULT: The bi-articular 
      model was evaluated in five subjects in comparison with the optical reference 
      system. The errors were computed in terms of distance between the reference 
      position of the trochlea (end-effector) and the correspondent model estimation. 
      The introduced method remarkably improved the estimation of the position of the 
      trochlea (and consequently the estimation of the hand position during reaching 
      activities) reducing position errors from 11.5 cm to 1.8 cm. CONCLUSION: Thanks 
      to the developed bi-articular model, we demonstrated a reliable estimation of the 
      upper arm kinematics with a minimal sensing system suitable for daily life 
      monitoring of recovery.

TI  - Progressive glenoid bone loss caused by erosion in humeral head resurfacing.
PG  - 1028-1033
LID - 10.1007/s00132-017-3483-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cementless surface replacement of the shoulder represents an 
      alternative to conventional stemmed anatomic prostheses. Glenoid erosion is 
      a well-known complication in hemiarthroplasty. However, there is limited data 
      concerning radiographic evaluation and prognostic factors for this phenomenon. 
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to determine the development of glenoid 
      erosion following shoulder resurfacing using a new measurement technique and 
      detect potential prognostic factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed 
      a retrospective analysis on 38 shoulders undergoing humeral head resurfacing with 
      a mean follow-up of 65.4 ± 43 months. Clinical and radiographic evaluation 
      followed a standardized protocol including pre- and postoperative Constant score, 
      active range of motion, and X‑rays in true anteroposterior view. Three 
      independent observers performed measurements of glenoid erosion. RESULTS: We 
      found good interobserver reliability for glenoid erosion measurements (intraclass 
      correlation coefficient [ICC] 0.74-0.78). Progressive glenoid erosion was present 
      in all cases, averaging 5.5 ± 3.9 mm at more than 5 years' follow-up. Male 
      patients demonstrated increased glenoid bone loss within the first 5 years (p < 
      0.04). The mean Constant score improved to 55.4 ± 23.6 points at the latest 
      follow-up. Younger age was correlated to increased functional outcome. Revision 
      rate due to painful glenoid erosion was 37%. CONCLUSIONS: Glenoid erosion can be 
      routinely expected in patients undergoing humeral head resurfacing. Painful 
      glenoid erosion leads to deterioration in functional outcome and necessitates 
      revision surgery in a high percentage of cases.

TI  - A comprehensive analysis of muscle recruitment patterns during shoulder flexion: 
      an electromyographic study.
PG  - 619-26
LID - 10.1002/ca.21123 [doi]
AB  - Although flexion is a common component of the routine clinical assessment of the 
      shoulder the muscle recruitment patterns during this movement are not clearly 
      understood making valid interpretation of potential muscle dysfunction 
      problematic. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively examine shoulder 
      muscle activity during flexion in order to compare the activity levels and 
      recruitment patterns of shoulder flexor, scapular lateral rotator and rotator 
      cuff muscles. Electromyographic (EMG) data were recorded from 12 shoulder muscles 
      sites in 15 volunteers. Flexion was performed in standing in the sagittal plane 
      at no load, 20%, and 60% of each subject's maximum load. EMG data were normalized 
      to maximum values obtained during maximum voluntary contractions. Results 
      indicated that anterior deltoid, pectoralis major, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, 
      serratus anterior, upper, and lower trapezius were activated at similar moderate 
      levels. However, subscapularis was activated at low levels and significantly 
      lower than supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Similar activity patterns across time 
      were demonstrated in the muscles that produce flexion torque, laterally rotate 
      the scapula, as well as supraspinatus and infraspinatus, and did not change as 
      flexion load increased. The onset of activity in supraspinatus and anterior 
      deltoid occurred at the same time and prior to movement of the limb at all loads 
      with infraspinatus activity also occurring prior to movement onset at the medium 
      and high load conditions only. Posterior rotator cuff muscles appear to be 
      counterbalancing anterior translational forces produced during flexion and it 
      would appear that supraspinatus is one of the muscles that consistently 
      "initiates" flexion.

TI  - Consistency of long-term outcome of acute Rockwood grade III acromioclavicular 
      joint separations after K-wire transfixation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical approach to acute Rockwood grade III acromioclavicular (AC) 
      joint injuries demands satisfying and reliable treatment results of shoulder 
      function in the long term. This study investigates the operative outcome of acute 
      grade III AC joint separations after temporary K-wire transfixation of the AC 
      joint over the years. We hypothesize, that the well-established temporary 
      articular transfixation of acute Rockwood grade III AC joint dislocations with 
      K-wires provides good and consistent functional outcome at long term. METHODS: 
      Seventy patients who underwent temporary articular transfixation of the AC joint 
      followed by a standardized rehabilitation program and early physiotherapeutic 
      exercising were divided into three follow-up cohorts. The treatment results were 
      investigated 1 to 2 years (short-term, group A, n = 18), 3 to 5 years (mid-term, 
      group B, n = 33), and 6 to 10 years (long-term, group C, n = 19) after surgical 
      procedure. The outcome was measured using a standardized functional patient 
      questionnaire including Constant score, ASES rating scale, SPADI, and XSMFA-D 
      score. The results given in average and mean +/- SD were compared between the 
      three cohorts by calculating the Kruskal-Wallis one way analysis for variance on 
      ranks. RESULTS: Average patient age at time of surgical therapy was 37 (+/-11) 
      years without significant difference between the three cohorts. Independent of 
      follow-up period all patients demonstrated good functional treatment results in 
      the long run expressed by an over all Constant score of 88 (+/-10) points, ASES 
      rating scale of 29 (+/-3) points, SPADI of 3 (+/-9) points, XSMFA-D function 
      score of 13 (+/-2) points, and XSMFA-D impairment score of 4 (+/-1) points, 
      respectively. The comparison of the three follow-up groups proved no significant 
      differences in outcome over a maximum follow-up period of up to 10 years. 
      However, the longer the follow-up period, the tendency of the promising treatment 
      outcome becomes more stable. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary K-wires fixation of acute 
      Rockwood grade III AC joint separations enable good long-term results in shoulder 
      function. The achieved functional outcome parameters reveal a high consistency in 
      the long run over the years.

TI  - Feasibility of an alternative method to estimate glenohumeral joint center from

AB  - Videogrammetry is commonly used to record upper limb motions. However, it cannot 
      track the glenohumeral joint center (GH). GH is required to reconstruct upper 
      limb motions. Therefore, it is often estimated by separately measuring scapular 
      motions using scapular kinematics measurements devices (SKMD). Applications of 
      SKMD are neither straightforward nor always noninvasive. Therefore, this work 
      investigates the feasibility of an alternative method to estimate GH from 
      videogrammetry using a CT/MRI image of subject's glenohumeral joint and without 
      requiring SKMD. In order to evaluate the method's accuracy, its GH estimations 
      were compared to reference GH trajectories. The method was also applied to 
      estimate scapular configurations and reconstruct an abduction motion measured by 
      videogrammetry. The accuracy of GH estimations were within 5 mm, and the 
      reconstructed motion was in good agreement with reported in vivo measurements.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The shoulder has the greatest range of motion of any joint in the 
      human body. This is due, in part, to the complex interplay between the 
      glenohumeral (GH) joint and the scapulothoracic (ST) articulation. Currently, our 
      ability to study shoulder kinematics is limited, because existing models isolate 
      the GH joint and rely on manual manipulation to create motion, and have low 
      reproducibility. Similarly, most established techniques track shoulder motion 
      discontinuously with limited accuracy. METHODS: To overcome these problems, we 
      have designed a novel system in which the shoulder girdle is studied intact, 
      incorporating both GH and ST motions. In this system, highly reproducible 
      trajectories are created using a robotic actuator to control the intact shoulder 
      girdle. High-speed cameras are employed to track retroreflective bone markers 
      continuously. RESULTS: We evaluated this automated system's capacity to 
      reproducibly capture GH translation in intact and pathologic shoulder conditions. 
      A pair of shoulders (left and right) were tested during forward elevation at 
      baseline, with a winged scapula, and after creation of a full thickness 
      supraspinatus tear. DISCUSSION: The system detected differences in GH 
      translations as small as 0.5 mm between different conditions. For each, three 
      consecutive trials were performed and demonstrated high reproducibility and high 
      precision.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of coracoclavicular 
      screw fixation in displaced distal clavicular fractures. METHODS: Sixteen 
      patients with Neer Type 2 displaced distal clavicle fractures were treated with 
      open reduction and internal fixation. Fixation was performed using a 
      coracoclavicular screw with washer application. After union the screw was removed 
      under local anesthesia. Radiographic evaluation was performed and the clinical 
      outcome was assessed using the Constant score. RESULTS: All patients achieved 
      painless osseous unions. However, one patient showed significant displacement of 
      the fracture due to loosening of the screw one month after surgery. The screw was 
      removed and the fracture was healed with some deformity. All patients returned to 
      their preinjury level in 3 months. The mean Constant score was 98. CONCLUSION: 
      Coracoclavicular screw fixation in the treatment of distal clavicular fractures 
      is a reliable, simple and cost effective technique.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brachial plexus birth palsy occurs in 0.4 to 4.6 of every 1000 live 
      births, with residual shoulder dysfunction in approximately one third of cases. 
      Clinical measures, such as the Mallet classification, provide no insight into the 
      scapulothoracic and glenohumeral contributions to tested global shoulder 
      movements. This study describes the scapulothoracic and glenohumeral components 
      of shoulder motion during the modified Mallet test. METHODS: Twelve children with 
      Erb's palsy (C5-6) and 8 children with extended Erb's palsy (C5-7) were 
      recruited. The unaffected limbs of 6 subjects were also tested. Locations of 
      markers placed on the thorax, humerus, and scapula were recorded in a neutral 
      position and each of the modified Mallet positions. Scapulothoracic, 
      glenohumeral, and humerothoracic helical displacements and acromion process 
      linear displacements were compared between groups. RESULTS: The brachial plexus 
      birth palsy groups exhibited significantly smaller glenohumeral displacements in 
      all modified Mallet positions and significantly larger scapulothoracic 
      displacements in the global external rotation and hand to mouth positions. 
      Discriminant function analysis using only humerothoracic variables correctly 
      classified 76.9% of subjects. Discriminant function analysis incorporating 
      scapulothoracic, glenohumeral, and acromion process displacement variables 
      produced accuracy of 92.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Children with brachial plexus birth 
      palsy demonstrated decreased glenohumeral contributions to achieve every modified 
      Mallet position and increased scapulothoracic contribution in two positions 
      compared with the unaffected group. Different scapulothoracic and glenohumeral 
      strategies were identified between groups. Finally, scapulothoracic and 
      glenohumeral components of shoulder motion are more specific than humerothoracic 
      measures to diagnostic classification.

AB  - Identification of scapular dyskinesis and evaluation of interventions depend on 
      the ability to properly measure scapulothoracic (ST) motion. The most widely used 
      measurement approach is the acromion marker cluster (AMC), which can yield large 
      errors in extreme humeral elevation and can be inaccurate in children and patient 
      populations. Recently, an individualized regression approach has been proposed as 
      an alternative to the AMC. This technique utilizes the relationship between ST 
      orientation, humerothoracic orientation and acromion process position derived 
      from calibration positions to predict dynamic ST orientations from humerothoracic 
      and acromion process measures during motion. These individualized regressions 
      demonstrated promising results for healthy adults; however, this method had not 
      yet been compared to the more conventional AMC. This study compared ST 
      orientation estimates by the AMC and regression approaches to static ST angles 
      determined by surface markers placed on palpated landmarks in typically 
      developing adolescents performing functional tasks. Both approaches produced 
      errors within the range reported in the literature for skin-based scapular 
      measurement techniques. The performance of the regression approach suffered when 
      applied to positions outside of the range of motion in the set of calibration 
      positions. The AMC significantly underestimated ST internal rotation across all 
      positions and overestimated posterior tilt in some positions. Overall, root mean 
      square errors for the regression approach were smaller than the AMC for every 
      position across all axes of ST motion. Accordingly, we recommend the regression 
      approach as a suitable technique for measuring ST kinematics in functional 
      motion.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Understanding the maturation of upper limb (UL) movement 
      characteristics in typically developing (TD) children is key to explore UL 
      deficits in those with neurodevelopmental disorders. Three-dimensional motion 
      analysis (3DMA) offers a reliable tool to comprehensively evaluate UL motion. 
      However, studies thus far mainly focused on specific pre-defined parameters 
      extracted from kinematic waveforms. Here, we investigated age-related differences 
      in UL movement characteristics over the entire movement cycle in TD children. 
      PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We assessed the non-dominant UL of 60 TD children (mean 
      age 10y3m±3y1m) using 3DMA during eight tasks: reaching (forwards (RF), upwards 
      (RU), sideways (RS)), reach-to-grasp (sphere (RGS), vertical cylinder (RGV)) and 
      activities-of-daily-living mimicking tasks (hand-to-head (HTH), hand-to-mouth 
      (HTM), hand-to-shoulder (HTS)). We investigated differences between four 
      age-groups (5-7y, 8-10y, 11-12y, 13-15y) in: (1) spatiotemporal parameters 
      (movement duration, peak velocity, time-to-peak velocity and trajectory 
      straightness), and (2) 12 UL joint angles, using Statistical Parametric Mapping 
      (SPM). RESULTS: We found that the 5-7y children moved with lower peak velocity 
      and less straight trajectories compared to the 11-12y group (peak velocity: RS, 
      HTS, p<0.01; trajectory: RU, RS, RGV, HTS, p<0.01) and the 13-15y group (peak 
      velocity: RF, RS, RGS, RGV, HTH, HTS, p<0.01; trajectory, all tasks, p<0.01). The 
      5-7y children showed increased scapular protraction compared to older children 
      (8-10y and 11-12y, HTS), as well as increased scapular medial rotation compared 
      to the 13-15y group (RGS). During RU, the 5-7y children moved more towards the 
      frontal plane (shoulder), unlike the 13-15y group. Lastly, the 5-7y group used 
      less elbow flexion than older children (11-12y and 13-15y) during HTH and HTS. 
      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our results point toward a maturation 
      in UL movement characteristics up to age 11-12y, when UL motion seemed to reach a 
      plateau. The reference values provided in this study will help to further 
      optimize the interpretation of UL deficits in children with neurodevelopmental 
      disorders.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review 
      was to summarize and evaluate intra- and interrater reliability research of 
      physical examination tests used for the assessment of scapular dyskinesis. 
      BACKGROUND: Scapular dyskinesis, defined as alteration of normal scapular 
      kinematics, is described as a non-specific response to different shoulder 
      pathologies. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, AMED and PEDro until March 20th, 2015. Methodological quality was 
      assessed with the Quality Appraisal of Reliability Studies (QAREL) by two 
      independent reviewers. RESULTS: The search strategy revealed 3259 articles, of 
      which 15 met the inclusion criteria. These studies evaluated the reliability of 
      41 test and test variations used for the assessment of scapular dyskinesis. 
      CONCLUSION: This review identified a lack of high-quality studies evaluating 
      intra- as well as interrater reliability of tests used for the assessment of 
      scapular dyskinesis. In addition, reliability measures differed between included 
      studies hindering proper cross-study comparisons. The effect of manual correction 
      of the scapula on shoulder symptoms was evaluated in only one study, which is 
      striking, since symptom alteration tests are used in routine care to guide 
      further treatment. Thus, there is a strong need for further research in this 
      area. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnosis, level 3a.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of scapular dyskinesis (SD) is of clinical interest, as SD 
      is believed to be related to shoulder pathology. However, no clinical assessment 
      with sufficient reliability to identify SD and provide treatment strategies is 
      available. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
      reliability of the comprehensive SD classification method. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional reliability study. METHOD: Sixty subjects with unilateral 
      shoulder pain were evaluated by two independent physiotherapists with a 
      visual-based palpation method. SD was classified as single abnormal scapular 
      pattern [inferior angle (pattern I), medial border (pattern II), superior border 
      of scapula prominence or abnormal scapulohumeral rhythm (pattern III)], a mixture 
      of the above abnormal scapular patterns, or normal pattern (pattern IV). The 
      assessment of SD was evaluated as subjects performed bilateral arm 
      raising/lowering movements with a weighted load in the scapular plane. Percentage 
      of agreement and kappa coefficients were calculated to determine reliability. 
      RESULTS: Agreement between the 2 independent physiotherapists was 83% (50/60, 6 
      subjects as pattern III and 44 subjects as pattern IV) in the raising phase and 
      68% (41/60, 5 subjects as pattern I, 12 subjects as pattern II, 12 subjects as 
      pattern IV, 12 subjects as mixed patterns I and II) in the lowering phase. The 
      kappa coefficients were 0.49-0.64. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the 
      visual-based palpation classification method for SD had moderate to substantial 
      inter-rater reliability. The appearance of different types of SD was more 
      pronounced in the lowering phase than in the raising phase of arm movements.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate functional outcomes and complications in a consecutive group 
      of patients with partial bursal rotator cuff tears (PBRCTs) treated with insitu 
      repair without acromioplasty. METHODS: Seventy-four patients who had undergone an 
      arthroscopic single row in situ repair for bursal-sided rotator cuff tears were 
      evaluated. Clinical assessment consisted of glenohumeral range of motion 
      measurement, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, and the University 
      of California at Los Angeles score. Pain was recorded using a visual analog 
      scale. Postoperative complications were also assessed. RESULTS: Mean age was 
      55.2 years (±6.3) with a minimum of 2-year follow-up. After arthroscopic repair, 
      all active range of motion parameters improved significantly (P < .0001). The 
      American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores improved from 42.5 to 86.1; the 
      University of California at Los Angeles scores improved from 15.8 to 31.4, and 
      the visual analog scale scores improved from 6.6 to 0.7 (P < .0001). Only 3 
      patients developed a postoperative adhesive capsulitis that responded to physical 
      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In the midterm follow-up (42 months), arthroscopic in situ 
      repair of PBRCTs without acromioplasty is a reliable procedure that produces 
      significant functional improvements and pain relief. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, 
      therapeutic case series.

TI  - Reliability, precision, accuracy, and validity of posterior shoulder tightness 
      assessment in overhead athletes.
PG  - 1922-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Posterior shoulder tightness with subsequent loss of humeral internal 
      rotation range of motion has been linked to upper extremity lesions in overhead 
      athletes. A valid clinical assessment is necessary to accurately identify 
      posterior shoulder tightness as a contributor to injury. PURPOSE: To describe a 
      modified supine assessment of posterior shoulder tightness by establishing the 
      reliability, precision, clinical accuracy, and validity of the assessment. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Intrasession, 
      intersession, and intertester reliability and precision were established by 
      comparing the commonly used side-lying assessment of posterior shoulder tightness 
      and the described modified supine assessment. Clinical accuracy of both methods 
      was obtained using an electromagnetic tracking device to track humeral and 
      scapular motion. Construct validity was established by identifying posterior 
      shoulder tightness in a group of overhead athletes (baseball pitchers and tennis 
      players) reported in the literature to have limited humeral internal rotation and 
      posterior shoulder tightness. RESULTS: The side-lying intrasession intraclass 
      correlation coeffecient (standard error of measurement), intersession intraclass 
      correlation coeffecient (standard error of measurement), and intertester 
      intraclass correlation coeffecient (standard error of measurement) were 0.83 cm 
      (0.9), 0.42 cm (1.7), and 0.69 cm (1.4), respectively. The supine intrasession 
      intraclass correlation coeffecient (standard error of measurement), intersession 
      intraclass correlation coeffecient (standard error of measurement), and 
      intertester intraclass correlation coeffecient (standard error of measurement) 
      were 0.91 degrees (1.1 degrees ), 0.75 degrees (1.8 degrees ), and 0.94 degrees 
      (1.8 degrees ), respectively. In side-lying, the clinical accuracy expected was 
      0.9 +/- 0.6 cm of error while, when measured supine, it was 3.5 degrees +/- 2.8 
      degrees of error. Both assessments resulted in minimal scapular protraction 
      (approximately 3.5 degrees ). Between groups, baseball pitchers and tennis 
      players had significantly less internal rotation range of motion (P < .0001) and 
      greater posterior shoulder tightness (P = .004) when measured in supine, but not 
      in side-lying (P = .312). CONCLUSION: Both methods resulted in good clinician 
      accuracy and precision, suggesting that both can be performed accurately. The 
      supine method can be assessed more reliably than side-lying between both sessions 
      and testers. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clinicians may want to consider use of the 
      supine method given the higher reliability, validity, and similar precision and 
      clinical accuracy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicians frequently rely on subjective categorization of 
      impairments in mobility, strength, and endurance for clinical decision-making; 
      however, these assessments are often unreliable and lack sensitivity to change. 
      The objective of this study was to determine the inter-rater reliability, minimum 
      detectable change (MDC), and group differences in quantitative cervicothoracic 
      measures for individuals with and without chronic neck pain (NP). METHODS: 
      Nineteen individuals with NP and 20 healthy controls participated in this case 
      control study. Two physical therapists performed a 30-minute examination on 
      separate days. A handheld dynamometer, gravity inclinometer, ruler, and stopwatch 
      were used to quantify cervical range of motion (ROM), cervical muscle strength 
      and endurance, and scapulothoracic muscle length and strength, respectively. 
      RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients for inter-rater reliability were 
      significantly greater than zero for most impairment measures, with point 
      estimates ranging from 0.45 to 0.93. The NP group exhibited reduced cervical ROM 
      (P ≤ 0.012) and muscle strength (P ≤ 0.038) in most movement directions, reduced 
      cervical extensor endurance (P = 0.029), and reduced rhomboid and middle 
      trapezius muscle strength (P ≤ 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate the 
      feasibility of obtaining objective cervicothoracic impairment measures with 
      acceptable inter-rater agreement across time. The clinical utility of these 
      measures is supported by evidence of impaired mobility, strength, and endurance 
      among patients with NP, with corresponding MDC values that can help establish 
      benchmarks for clinically significant change.

      dynamic tasks in healthy participants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glenohumeral displacements assessment would help to design shoulder 
      prostheses with physiological arthrokinematics and to establish more biofidelic 
      musculoskeletal models. Though displacements were documented during static tasks, 
      there is little information on their 3D coupling with glenohumeral angle during 
      dynamic tasks. Our objective was to characterize the 3D glenohumeral 
      displacement-rotation couplings during dynamic arm elevations and rotations. 
      METHODS: Glenohumeral displacements were measured from trajectories of reflective 
      markers fitted on intracortical pins inserted into the scapula and humerus. Bone 
      geometry was recorded using CT-scan. Only four participants were recruited to the 
      experiment due to its invasiveness. Participants performed dynamic arm abduction, 
      flexion and axial rotations. Linear regressions were performed between 
      glenohumeral displacements and rotations. The pin of the scapula of one 
      participant moved, his data were removed from analysis, and results are based on 
      three participants. FINDINGS: The measurement error of glenohumeral kinematics 
      was less than 0.15mm and 0.2°. Maximum glenohumeral displacements were measured 
      along the longitudinal direction and reached up to +12.4mm for one participant. 
      Significant couplings were reported especially between longitudinal displacement 
      and rotation in abduction (adjusted R(2) up to 0.94). INTERPRETATION: The 
      proposed method provides the potential to investigate glenohumeral kinematics 
      during all kinds of movements. A linear increase of upward displacement during 
      dynamic arm elevation was measured, which contrasts with results based on a 
      series of static poses. The systematic investigation of glenohumeral 
      displacements under dynamic condition may help to provide relevant recommendation 
      for the design of shoulder prosthetic components and musculoskeletal models.

TI  - Effect of glenoid implant design on glenohumeral stability: an experimental 
      study.
PG  - 782-8
LID - 10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2012.04.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Though several glenoid implants were developed over the past years, a 
      high rate of glenoid loosening remains. This complication is linked to the 
      glenohumeral stability, defined as humeral head translation. In an intact 
      shoulder, this concept is ensured by all active and passive elements, 
      particularly the labrum. Two features of a glenoid implant can be adjusted to 
      improve the stability, or, in other words, to decrease the translations: the 
      first is the mismatch, defined as the difference of curvature between the 
      prosthetic head and glenoid; the second is the shape of the glenoid component. 
      Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the performance of 2 
      glenoid components (Ceraver, Roissy, France): (1) a standard design and (2) a 
      design named "labrum design" with a superior part simulating the anatomic labrum. 
      METHODS: An experimental device was developed to evaluate forces and kinematics. 
      The device simulated active, dynamic and continuous abduction of an entire arm. 
      It reproduced the Scapulo-Humeral Rhythm. The labrum design was installed first. 
      To evaluate the effect of mismatch on the glenohumeral stability, 3 humeral heads 
      were tested, corresponding to the ones recommended by the company. The experiment 
      was repeated for the standard design. FINDINGS: The results obtained show a 
      general decrease of the prosthetic head translation with the labrum design 
      compared to the standard design. No noticeable effect of mismatch was found. 
      INTERPRETATION: A proof of concept of the interest of the artificial labrum was 
      provided since it improved the glenohumeral stability.

TI  - [Intra- and interobserver reproducibility of the French version of the 
      Constant-Murley shoulder assessment during rehabilitation after rotator cuff 
      surgery].
PG  - 142-9
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The Constant-Murley scapular score is currently considered 
      to be the gold standard for shoulder assessment in Europe. Few studies have 
      examined the metrological qualities of this score. Our aim was to study the 
      reliability and validity of the French version in a population undergoing 
      reeducation after rotator cuff surgery. We wanted to determine how pertinent the 
      score is during the reeducation phase (1-12 months after surgery). MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: Fifty-three patients volunteered to participate in this study. Shoulder 
      assessment was performed by three observers. Intraobserver reproducibility was 
      determined for 102 tests and two series of 32 and 56 tests were used to determine 
      interobserver reproducibility. The internal coherence was studied on a sample of 
      61 tests. Three observers analyzed the apparent validity of the Constant Murley 
      score. RESULTS: The correlations were satisfactory (intraobserver 0.96; 
      interobserver 0.91 and 0.89 with the Spearman test) and sensitive (intraobserver 
      0.01; interobserver 0.07 and 0.01 with the Wilcoxon test). Despite satisfactory 
      internal coherence (Cronbach alpha=0.75), the reproducibility of the overall 
      score did not correspond necessarily to the reproducibility of the constituent 
      scores. The measurement error might be related to patient- and observer-related 
      interpretation variability. The apparent validity of the French version might be 
      criticized for assessing rotator cuffs after surgery. CONCLUSION: A precise 
      consensual protocol is needed for conducting the shoulder assessment and 
      establishing the Constant-Murley score during the reeducation phase after rotator 
      cuff surgery.

TI  - Tracking the scapula using the scapula locator with and without feedback from 
      pressure-sensors: A comparative study.
PG  - 1633-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.02.139 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The scapula locator method has associated intra-observer and 
      inter-observer errors caused by the dependency on the observer to locate the 
      scapular landmarks. The potential effect of the pressures applied by the observer 
      on the measured scapular kinematics when this method is used has also been 
      overlooked so far. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of using 
      feedback on the pressures applied on the scapula using the locator on the 
      intra-observer and inter-observer reliabilities of the method as well as on the 
      kinematics obtained using this method. METHODS: Three observers tracked the 
      scapular motion of the dominant shoulder of each subject using the locator with 
      no reference to pressure-feedback for three trials of bilateral elevation in the 
      scapular plane and using the locator with pressure-feedback for three other 
      trials. Variations between the measurements obtained were used to calculate the 
      intra-observer errors and variations between the measurements obtained by the 
      three observers for the same subject were used to calculate inter-observer 
      errors. Repeated-measures ANOVA tests were used to look at differences between 
      the two methods in terms of intra-observer and inter-observer errors and scapular 
      kinematics. FINDINGS: Using pressure-feedback reduced the intra-observer errors 
      but had no effect on the inter-observer errors. Different scapular kinematics was 
      measured using the two methods. INTERPRETATIONS: Pressure-feedback improves the 
      reliability of the scapula locator method. Differences in the scapular kinematics 
      suggest that unregulated pressures have an effect on the physiological scapular 
      motion.

      68% confidence and 2 SEs of measurement (for the 95% CI) for the bilateral 
      angular measurements of scapular rotation and tilt, and the bilateral linear 
      measurements of lateral scapular displacement (protraction) and vertical 
      displacement (elevation). RESULTS: For subjects without symptoms, ICC(2,3) 
      results ranged from .75 to .98. The 2 SE results for the angular movements ranged 
      from 1.8 degrees to 2.4 degrees and from 0.4 to 1.0 cm for the direct linear 
      measurements. Subjects with symptoms: ICC(2,3) results ranged from .61 to .98. 
      The 2 SE results for the angular movements ranged from 1.4 degrees to 2 degrees 
      and from 0.6 to 1 cm for the direct linear measurements. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Repeated-measure (ICC(2,3)) results were more reliable than single-measure 
      (ICC(2,1)) results. Very good to excellent intraobserver reliability was 
      demonstrated for the angular and linear measurements of interest in both 
      shoulders of subjects with and without symptoms. The 2 SE results provide 
      guidance about the error associated with the individual measurements and will 
      assist the clinician determining whether a change in the static position of the 
      scapula has occurred as a result of intervention or over time. (National Research

TI  - The Specific AC Score (SACS): a new and validated method of assessment of 
      isolated acromioclavicular joint pathology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acromioclavicular (AC) joint (ACJ) pathology is a common cause of 
      shoulder dysfunction, and treatment recommendations vary. When the efficacy of 
      treatment is evaluated, the ability to measure outcomes specific to the 
      population is essential. The aim of the current research was to develop and 
      validate a specific ACJ questionnaire. METHODS: Items for the "Specific AC Score" 
      (SACS) were generated through the use of an expert panel, existing 
      questionnaires, and patient feedback. Preliminary data analysis identified 
      redundancy of items resulting in the questionnaire being refined. The final SACS 
      was evaluated in 125 patients requiring surgical intervention of the ACJ. 
      Internal consistency (the Cronbach α and corrected item-total correlation), 
      content validity, criterion validity, responsiveness, and test-retest reliability 
      (intraclass correlation coefficient) were examined and compared with the Shoulder 
      Pain and Disability Index, Oxford Shoulder Score, and American Shoulder and Elbow 
      Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form. The minimum detectable change 
      score was calculated. RESULTS: The Cronbach α for the total scale preoperatively 
      and postoperatively was high (preoperatively = 0.91, postoperatively = 0.93). All 
      3 domains (Pain, Function, Quality of Life) demonstrated acceptable internal 
      consistency (α > 0.70), and the correlation between items in each domain was 
      satisfactory. The responsiveness was excellent (effect size, -2.32; standard 
      response mean, -1.85) and was higher than the other general shoulder 
      questionnaires. There were no relevant floor or ceiling effects. Reliability was 
      high (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.89) and the minimum detectable change 
      was 6.5 points. DISCUSSION: This new ACJ-specific questionnaire has been robustly 
      developed, has good measurement properties, and has excellent responsiveness. The 
      SACS is recommended for measuring outcomes in ACJ patients.

LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2015.08.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because of detachment of the pectoralis minor and variation of the 
      vector of the conjoint tendons, we hypothesized that the Latarjet procedure may 
      alter scapular position and motion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
      scapular position and motion in patients who underwent a Latarjet or a modified 
      iliac crest bone graft transfer (ICBGT) procedure (J-bone graft). METHODS: 
      Forty-six consecutive patients treated for recurrent anterior shoulder 
      dislocation between 2010 and 2012 were retrospectively enrolled. Twenty-three 
      were treated with a Latarjet and 23 with an ICBGT procedure. Twenty Latarjet and 
      20 ICBGT patients were available at a mean follow-up of 20 months (min, 12; max, 
      60). We recorded the Western Ontario Instability Index, the Rowe Score, and the 
      Subjective Shoulder Value. Scapulothoracic position was studied according to the 
      dyskinesis yes/no method. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability of the 
      dyskinesis assessment was assessed. RESULTS: Intraobserver and interobserver 
      reliability of scapula dyskinesis assessment was high (Latarjet: intratester, κ = 
      0.84; intertester, κ = 0.75; ICBGT: intratester, κ = 0.78; intertester, κ = 
      0.71). Scapular dyskinesis was observed after 5 of 20 Latarjet and after 0 of 20 
      ICBGT procedures (P = .047). Patients with dyskinesis had lower scores (Western 
      Ontario Instability Index, P = .043; Rowe, P = .047; Subjective Shoulder Value, P 
      = .046), but no statistically significant difference was found between the 
      Latarjet and ICBGT groups. Two of the 5 scapular dyskinesis patients reached the 
      SICK (Scapular malposition, Inferior medial scapular winging, Coracoid 
      tenderness, and scapular dysKinesis) scapula syndrome definition. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Scapular dyskinesis was found in 5 of 20 patients who underwent a Latarjet 
      procedure. Dyskinesis may be related to the detachment of the pectoralis minor, 
      and variation of the vector and the working length of the coracobrachialis and 
      the short head of the biceps.

TI  - Can Shoulder Muscle Activity Be Evaluated With Ultrasound Shear Wave 
      Elastography?
PG  - 1276-1283
LID - 10.1097/01.blo.0000533628.06091.0a [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative assessment of rotator cuff muscle activity is important 
      in the treatment of shoulder disorders. However, the known methods for assessing 
      rotator cuff muscle activity thus far have been inaccurate, invasive, and 
      inconvenient. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does the activity of the deltoid, 
      supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles measured using ultrasound shear wave 
      elastography have a linear correlation with muscle activity assessed using 
      generally used methods, including isokinetic dynamometry and electromyography? 
      (2) Does the activity of the deltoid, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles 
      measured using shear wave elastography show good intraobserver and interobserver 
      reliability? METHODS: Twelve volunteers participated in intrasession reliability 
      experiments. They were asked to perform isometric abduction, external rotation, 
      and scaption contractions (defined as elevation of the arm within the plane of 
      the scapula with neutral arm rotation) gradually increased from 0% to 75% of 
      maximal voluntary contraction. The joint torque, electromyographic activity, and 
      shear elastic modulus were synchronously measured in the middeltoid, 
      supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles. The validity of the elastic modulus 
      value was assessed using regression analysis between normalized torque and 
      electromyographic root mean square values. For intraobserver and interobserver 
      reliability measurements, repeated experiments were performed with the same 
      protocol. RESULTS: The shear elastic modulus and normalized joint torque with 
      isokinetic dynamometry showed a linear relationship in all muscles (deltoid, 
      supraspinatus, and infraspinatus) and each of the ultrasonography planes 
      (longitudinal and transverse) (mean R > 0.8 and p < 0.001 for all measurements). 
      For the supraspinatus muscle, the mean slope of the relationship between shear 
      elastic modulus in the longitudinal plane and the normalized joint torque during 
      scaption contraction was 1.28 ± 0.39 kPa/%MVC (mean R = 0.93 ± 0.21, p < 0.001). 
      Furthermore, similar results were obtained in relation to electromyography root 
      mean square values (mean R > 0.8 and p < 0.001 in all measurements). For the 
      supraspinatus muscle, the mean slope of the relationship between shear elastic 
      modulus in the longitudinal plane and electromyographic (EMG) root mean square 
      was 0.96 ± 0.27 kPa/%EMG (mean R = 0.91 ± 0.08, p < 0.001). The intraobserver and 
      interobserver reliabilities were excellent in all positions (abduction, external 
      rotation, and scaption) and in both the longitudinal and transverse 
      ultrasonography planes (all intraclass correlation coefficients are > 0.85). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Shoulder muscle activity can be noninvasively evaluated with 
      ultrasound shear wave elastography. Clinician and scientists should consider the 
      application of this technique in cases in which evaluation of shoulder muscle 
      activity is required. The next step after this study will be to check the shear 
      elastic modulus of rotator cuff muscle in patients with rotator cuff tear. We 
      plan to evaluate the correlation between shear elastic modulus and joint torque 
      according to tear size and fatty infiltration status of rotator cuff muscle. 
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Shear wave electrography can be used to measure various 
      tissue elasticities in both static and dynamic modes. It may be a useful tool to 
      evaluate pre- and postoperative rotator cuff muscle activity in a relatively 
      simple manner. Shoulder function after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty 
      associated with deltoid muscle activity also may be evaluated. Changes in tissue 
      tightness in shoulder disorders caused by increase soft tissue stiffness (ie, 
      adhesive capsulitis and glenohumeral internal rotation deficit) can be evaluated.

TI  - Borderline Glenoid Bone Defect in Anterior Shoulder Instability: Latarjet 
      Procedure Versus Bankart Repair.
PG  - 2170-2176
LID - 10.1177/0363546518776978 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal procedure for anterior shoulder instability with a 
      borderline (15%-20%) bone defect on the anterior rim of the glenoid is still 
      controversial. PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcome and recurrence rate 
      between the arthroscopic Bankart repair and Latarjet procedure among patients 
      with recurrent anterior shoulder instability and a borderline glenoid bone 
      defect. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The authors 
      retrospectively reviewed cases of arthroscopic Bankart repair and the Latarjet 
      procedure for recurrent anterior shoulder instability with a borderline (15%-20%) 
      glenoid bone defect. Enrollment comprised 149 patients (Bankart group, n = 118; 
      Latarjet group, n = 31). The mean follow-up and age at operation were 28.9 ± 7.3 
      months (range, 24-73 months) and 26 ± 5 years (range, 16-46 years), respectively. 
      RESULTS: Rowe and UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) shoulder scores 
      significantly improved from 42.0 ± 14.3 and 22.9 ± 3.2 preoperatively to 90.9 ± 
      15.4 and 32.5 ± 3.3 postoperatively in the Bankart group ( P < .001) and from 
      41.0 ± 17.9 and 22.3 ± 3.4 to 91.1 ± 16.1 and 32.3 ± 3.4 in the Latarjet group ( 
      P < .001), respectively. There were no significant between-group differences in 
      Rowe ( P = .920) or UCLA ( P = .715) scores at the final follow-up. Mean 
      postoperative loss of motion during forward flexion, external rotation in 
      abduction, and internal rotation to the posterior was 3.0° ± 6.2°, 11.6° ± 10.2°, 
      and 0.6 spinal segment in the Bankart group and 3.7° ± 9.8°, 10.3° ± 12.8°, and 
      0.9 spinal segment in the Latarjet group, respectively. These differences were 
      not significant. However, the loss of external rotation at the side was 
      significantly greater in the Bankart group (13.3° ± 12.9°) than in the Latarjet 
      group (7.3° ± 18.1°, P = .034). The overall recurrence rate was significantly 
      higher in the Bankart group (22.9%) than in the Latarjet group (6.5%), ( P = 
      .040). CONCLUSION: The Latarjet procedure and arthroscopic Bankart repair both 
      provided satisfactory clinical outcome scores and pain relief for anterior 
      shoulder instability with a borderline glenoid bone defect. However, the Latarjet 
      procedure resulted in significantly lower recurrences and less external rotation 
      limitation than the arthroscopic Bankart repair. Therefore, the Latarjet 
      procedure could be a more reliable surgical option in anterior recurrent 
      instability with a borderline glenoid bone defect.

TI  - The relation of joint laxity and trunk rotation.
PG  - 38-41
AB  - A study was designed to evaluate the joint laxity during scoliosis screening, and 
      to show if there is a relation of joint laxity values to the trunk rotation. One 
      thousand, two hundred and seventy-three children (598 females, 675 males) with an 
      average age of 10.4 years were screened with a scoliometer and forward bending 
      for trunk rotations. Scapular and shoulder elevations, flexible pes planus were 
      recorded and joint laxity was evaluated with the Beighton score. There was high 
      inter-observer and intra-observer reliability for both scoliometer and Beighton 
      scores. In 41 children (3.2%) with Beighton score 7 or higher, trunk rotation 
      measurements were higher than for the rest of the children. Trunk rotation 
      measurements of 7 degrees or higher were found in 30 children, who were more lax 
      than the rest of the group and were invited for radiography, with a detection of 
      curves between 11 and 18 degrees in 10 of them. The Beighton score is a practical 
      and reliable method for defining joint laxity. Although the number of patients 
      with scoliosis was limited, there are findings supporting the relation between 
      joint laxity and scoliosis. Moreover, there was increased laxity in children with 
      increased trunk rotations. Ligamentous laxity may be one of the causes changing 
      the contour of the back.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In case of people suffering from chronic low back pain, specific 
      movements of the hip, pelvis, and trunk are associated with pain. Comparing range 
      of motion measurements for multiple planes and from different segments and lines 
      in reference to those of healthy individuals seems interesting but present 
      interpretations challenge in relation to important number of variables and 
      correlation with clinical data. METHODS: The proposed index is based on using 
      principal component analysis to quantify differences in trunk mobility between 
      patients with chronic low back pain and a control group. Kinematic data were 
      recorded for the cervical and thoracic vertebrae, the lumbar spine, and the 
      pelvic and scapular belts during repeated trials (hip flexion and extension, hip 
      bending, and trunk twists). Angular motion values were calculated. Principal 
      component analysis was used to convert 10 discrete variables (kinematical data) 
      extracted from control data into 10 independent variables. FINDINGS: The proposed 
      index comprises the sum of the variables. Initial demonstration of its clinical 
      utility and statistical tests of this index validity were revealed. It 
      establishes correlations between the psychosocial impact of chronic low back 
      pain, trunk mobility (as summarized by the index) and the positive effects of 
      functional restoration program. INTERPRETATION: This index let to assess the 
      absolute potential benefits of rehabilitation in term of kinematic motion. 
      Functional restoration program promotes the physical functioning of patients by 
      increasing their range of motion. This index uses kinematic motion to assess the 
      potential benefits of such rehabilitation program.

TI  - Is there an association between a low acromion index and osteoarthritis of the 
      shoulder?
PG  - 1005-10
LID - 10.1007/s00264-009-0898-7 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between a low acromion 
      index and osteoarthritis of the shoulder. Three patient groups were used: (I) 
      instability, n = 53; (II) calcifying tendonitis, n = 109; and (III) 
      osteoarthritis, n = 120. Standardised digital X-rays were evaluated from the true 
      anteroposterior and axillary views. Joint space width at three levels in each 
      plane and the size of humeral osteophytes were measured and osteoarthritis was 
      graded according to Samilson. The acromion index was calculated according to 
      Nyffeler et al. (J Bone Joint Surg Am 88:800-805, 2006) in the true 
      anteroposterior view. There were two independent investigators. Interobserver 
      reliability was excellent for all measurements in the anteroposterior (AP) 
      projection but inferior in the axillary projections, especially in group III. The 
      mean acromion index was 0.64 ± 0.07 in group I, 0.64 ± 0.08 in group II and 0.73 
      ± 0.12 in group III. The acromion index was not correlated with the joint space 
      width nor with the size of the osteophytes or the Samilson grading in group III. 
      The data of the study did not show a significant association between a low 
      acromion index and typical signs of osteoarthritis at the shoulder. The 
      theoretical concept of a small acromion index associated with the development of 
      osteoarthritis of the shoulder is not supported.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of isometric horizontal 
      abduction using Thera-Band during three exercises (forward flexion, scaption, and 
      wall push-up plus) in subjects with scapular winging by investigating the 
      electromyographic (EMG) amplitude of the pectoralis major, serratus anterior and 
      the pectoralis major/serratus anterior activity ratio. Twenty-four males with 
      scapular winging participated in this study. The subjects performed the forward 
      flexion, scaption, and wall push-up plus with and without isometric horizontal 
      abduction using Thera-Band. Surface EMG was used to collect the EMG data of the 
      pectoralis major and serratus anterior during the three exercises. Two-way 
      repeated analyses of variance with two within-subject factors (isometric 
      horizontal abduction condition and exercise type) were used to determine the 
      statistical significance of pectoralis major and serratus anterior EMG activity 
      and the pectoralis major/serratus anterior EMG activity ratio. Pectoralis major 
      EMG activity was significantly lower during forward flexion and wall push-up plus 
      with isometric horizontal abduction, and serratus anterior EMG activity was 
      significantly greater with isometric horizontal abduction. Additionally, the 
      pectoralis major/serratus anterior activity ratio was significantly lower during 
      the forward flexion and wall push-up plus with isometric horizontal abduction. 
      The results of this study suggest that isometric horizontal abduction using 
      Thera-Band can be used as an effective method to facilitate the serratus anterior 
      activity and to reduce excessive pectoralis major activity during exercises for 
      activating serratus anterior.

TI  - The relationship between clinical outcomes and the amount of arthroscopic 
      acromial resection.
PG  - 34-9
AB  - PURPOSE: In 47 consecutive patients who had a shoulder impingement syndrome 
      treated by arthroscopic subacromial decompression, we compared the functional 
      outcome with the amount of the acromion resection. TYPE OF STUDY: Prospective 
      study. METHODS: The inclusion criteria for patient selection was a chronic 
      impingement syndrome unresolved by conservative treatment with an intact rotator 
      cuff or with an irreparable rupture of the rotator cuff. The assessment was 
      performed with the scoring system of Constant preoperatively and postoperatively. 
      Quantitative measurements of the acromion resection were made by comparing 
      preoperative and postoperative anteroposterior radiographic views, standardized 
      under fluoroscopic control in order to become reproducible and comparable. There 
      were 39 patients (41 shoulders) available for follow-up at 37 months. RESULTS: 
      The condition of the shoulder, concerning pain, motion and activities, was 
      improved at the time of follow-up, the mean gain of the total functional score 
      was 29 points/100. Age, side, activity, duration of pain before procedure and 
      cuff statement had no influence on preoperative and postoperative Constant's 
      score. The difference between preoperative and postoperative measurements of 
      anterior acromion protuberance was significant. There was no correlation between 
      the amount of the acromion resection and the improvement of Constant's score (P 
      =.84). CONCLUSIONS: The origin of impingement syndrome is multi-factorial, and 
      efficiency of arthroscopic decompression may not be only due to the amount of 
      acromion resection. From these results and a literature review, this study 
      analyzes several morphologic factors, which could explain the good results of 
      arthroscopic subacromial decompression in impingement syndrome.

TI  - Design and development of a computer assisted glenoid implantation technique for 
      shoulder replacement surgery.
PG  - 152-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Replacement of the diseased shoulder joint with implants is a 
      procedure whose frequency is rapidly increasing. However, glenoid replacement 
      remains challenging due to the difficult joint exposure and visualization of 
      anatomical reference landmarks during the procedure. Improper positioning of the 
      glenoid component can lead to early failure. The objective of this study was to 
      develop and evaluate a Computer Assisted Glenoid Implantation (CAGI) technique to 
      achieve a more accurate and reliable placement of the glenoid component. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty cadaveric scapulae were imaged with CT. The 
      accuracy of an electromagnetic tracking system and 3D surface modeling for the 
      measurement of glenoid position was compared to that of the standard CT-based 
      method. Custom jigs were then developed to track instruments and to correct for 
      scapular motion during in vitro trials. A standardized protocol for determining, 
      in real time, the glenoid position and placement was developed and validated. 
      RESULTS: The version angles measured by the tracking system, CT, and the 3D 
      modeling software were 0.0 +/- 1.2 degrees , -1.3 +/- 1.0 degrees , and -1.1 +/- 
      1.1 degrees , respectively. The magnitudes for inclination angles were 0.7 +/- 
      0.7 degrees , 0.9 +/- 0.8 degrees , and 1.0 +/- 0.7 degrees , respectively. A 
      statistically significant difference was found only between measurements made 
      with the tracking system and with CT (p < 0.05). Testing of the CAGI system in a 
      cadaveric trial resulted in an accuracy of 1.17 degrees of version and 0.60 
      degrees of inclination. The procedure was readily performed with excellent 
      feedback and guidance for the surgeon. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative planning using 
      CT imaging with 3D modeling and intraoperative tracking were combined to produce 
      improved accuracy and reliability of glenoid implantation in the setting of total 
      shoulder arthroplasty.

TI  - Diagnosis of Engaging Bipolar Bone Defects in the Shoulder Using 2-Dimensional 
      Computed Tomography: A Cadaveric Study.
PG  - 2771-2777
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anatomic studies have demonstrated that bipolar glenoid and humeral 
      bone loss have a cumulative effect on shoulder instability and that these defects 
      may engage in functional positions depending on their size and location, 
      potentially resulting in failure of stabilization procedures. Determining which 
      lesions pose a risk for engagement remains challenging, with arthroscopic 
      assessments and a 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT)-based glenoid track 
      method being accepted approaches at this time. PURPOSE: The purpose was to 
      investigate the interaction of humeral and glenoid bone defects on shoulder 
      engagement in a cadaveric model. Two alternative approaches to predicting 
      engagement were evaluated: (1) CT of the shoulder in abduction and external 
      rotation (ABER) and (2) measurement of the glenoid lesion width and measurement 
      of a novel parameter, the intact anterior articular angle (IAAA), on conventional 
      2-dimensional multiplane reformats. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. 
      METHODS: Hill-Sachs and glenoid defects of varying sizes were created in 12 
      cadaveric upper limbs, producing 45 bipolar defect combinations. The defect 
      characteristics were assessed using CT with the shoulder in a neutral position. 
      ABER CT was performed with the shoulder positioned in 60° of glenohumeral 
      abduction (corresponding to 90° of abduction relative to the trunk) and 90° of 
      external rotation. The IAAA was measured as the cartilage arc angle anterior to 
      the Hill-Sachs defect on the axial slice bisecting the humeral head. The 
      performance of the ABER CT and IAAA approaches to predicting engagement were 
      compared with the glenoid track method. RESULTS: Of the 45 defect combinations, 
      24 (53%) were classified as engaging using the glenoid track method. ABER CT 
      predicted engagement accurately in 43 of 45 (96%), with a sensitivity and 
      specificity of 92% and 100%, respectively. A logistic model based on the glenoid 
      defect width and IAAA provided a prediction accuracy of 87%, with a sensitivity 
      and specificity of 92% and 81%, respectively. CONCLUSION/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 
      Bipolar lesions at risk for engagement can be identified accurately using an ABER 
      CT scan or by performing 2-dimensional measurements of the glenoid defect width 
      and IAAA on conventional CT multiplane reformats. This information will be useful 
      for surgical planning in the setting of bipolar bone defects before shoulder 
      stabilization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Altered scapular muscle activity is associated with abnormal scapular 
      motions and shoulder pain. Hence, quantification of these activities is a 
      challenging issue. OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to establish the 
      reliability of measuring levator scapula muscle thickness and to examine how 
      thickness of this muscle changes with contraction. METHODS: Twenty-one 
      asymptomatic individuals (mean age 22.29 ± 2.17 years) participated in this 
      study. Three separate ultrasound images of the levator scapula muscle were 
      captured at the neck-shoulder junction at rest and during a loaded isometric 
      contraction. The procedures were repeated twice, four to seven days apart to 
      establish intra-rater test-retest reliability. Interclass correlation coefﬁcients 
      (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM) were used to determine the 
      reliability, and a paired t-test was performed to examine the difference in 
      muscle thickness between two conditions. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that 
      intra-examiner reliability was good at rest (ICC = 0.88, SEM = 1.16 mm) and 
      excellent during loaded isometric contraction (ICC = 0.95, SEM = 0.91 mm). 
      Furthermore, the thickness of levator scapula muscle signiﬁcantly increased from 
      rest to the loaded isometric contraction (Effect size = 1.99, P < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the thickness of the levator scapula 
      muscle can be measured reliably at the neck-shoulder junction. Furthermore, 
      ultrasound measures can reliably detect changes in muscle thickness from rest to 
      a contracted state. Therefore, if the need exists to evaluate muscle morphology 
      before and after any treatment strategy, thickness measurement of levator scapula 
      can be determined reliably using ultrasound.

PG  - 2176-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2012.05.048 [doi]
AB  - The immediate goal of this study was to develop and validate a noninvasive, 
      computational surface mapping approach for measuring scapular kinematics by using 
      available motion capture technology in an innovative manner. The long-term goal 
      is to facilitate clinical determination of the role of the scapula in children 
      with brachial plexus birth palsy (BPBP). The population for this study consisted 
      of fourteen healthy adults with prominent scapulae. Subject-specific scapular 
      templates were created using the coordinates of five scapular landmarks obtained 
      from palpation with subjects seated and arms relaxed in a neutral position. The 
      scapular landmarks were re-palpated and their locations recorded in the six arm 
      positions of the modified Mallet classification. The six Mallet positions were 
      repeated with approximately 300 markers covering the scapula. The markers formed 
      a surface map covering the tissue over the scapula. The scapular template created 
      in the neutral position was iteratively fit to the surface map of each trial, 
      providing an estimate of the orientation of the scapula. These estimates of 
      scapular orientation were compared to the known scapular orientation determined 
      from the scapular landmarks palpated in each Mallet position. The magnitude of 
      the largest mean difference about an anatomical axis between the two measures of 
      scapular orientation was 3.8° with an RMS error of 5.9°. This technique is 
      practical for populations with visibly prominent scapulae (e.g., BPBP patients), 
      for which it is a viable alternative to existing clinical methods with comparable 
      accuracy.

TI  - Marker-Based Method for Analyzing the Three-Dimensional Upper Body Kinematics of 
      Violinists and Violists: Development and Clinical Feasibility.
PG  - 179-190
LID - 10.21091/mppa.2019.4029 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: High string players (violin and viola) often suffer from musculoskeletal 
      disorders. Although 3D motion analysis has proved helpful in diagnosing different 
      musculoskeletal syndromes and identifying injurious movement patterns in violin 
      and viola performance, more detailed analyses of upper body movement strategies 
      and especially of the shoulder complex have not yet been recorded. The use of 
      spherical surface markers on some anatomical landmarks is, however, inappropriate 
      when an instrument is being played. The aim of this study was to develop and 
      evaluate a novel marker-based method for analyzing upper body kinematics of high 
      string players using conditions specific to violin and viola playing. METHODS: A 
      custom upper body marker set was developed and a biomechanical model applied to 
      3D motion capture data of the pelvis, thorax, spine, head, and both upper limbs 
      (scapula, upper arm, forearm, hand) of 12 professional violinists, to assess its 
      clinical feasibility. FINDINGS: Lumbar and thoracic spine, thorax, neck, and left 
      upper limb were quite static, while extensive motion occurred in the right upper 
      limb. Most rotation angles showed a reasonable intersubject variability except 
      for glenohumeral and wrist joints. Significant differences were observed between 
      G- and D-string bowing, especially in the left wrist and right shoulder joints. 
      INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that the proposed method is a valid tool for 
      quantifying upper body movements in violin and viola performance. With the 
      extended upper body model, it will improve understanding of the motor strategies 
      adopted by high string players and may contribute to injury prevention, 
      diagnosis, and treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Shoulder assessment in rehabilitation is focused on kinematic 
      properties due to the variability of symptomatology and clinical expression of 
      shoulder injuries. AIM: To perform a receiver operating characteristic analysis 
      of the kinematic variables involved in the functional mobility of the shoulder 
      that allow the identification of discriminating variables between healthy and 
      diseased shoulders during scaption motion. METHOD: Analytical cross-sectional 
      study of diagnostic effectiveness was performed in 27 subjects suffering from 
      shoulder damage and 14 asymptomatic controls. Scaption kinematics were evaluated 
      using four inertial sensors placed on the humerus, scapula, forearm and sternum. 
      Three variables (mobility, velocity and acceleration) were obtained from each 
      sensor and the norm of the resultant vector was calculated from each axis. A 
      discriminatory receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed, 
      obtaining the area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity. FINDINGS: 
      Significant differences from both the resultant vectors and the axis depended on 
      the body segment analysed were observed. Greater movement velocity and 
      acceleration were observed in the asymptomatic group. Receiver operating 
      characteristic analysis, scapular protraction-retraction mobility distinguished 
      with a diagnostic sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 90.9% between 
      asymptomatic and shoulder-damaged patients. These diagnosis values were 83.3% and 
      72.7% for scapular anterior-posterior velocity. Scapular kinematics, in terms of 
      mobility and velocity, are the key variables in shoulder assessment. 
      INTERPRETATION: This study discriminated between patients suffering from shoulder 
      damage and asymptomatic subjects based on shoulder kinematics during scaption 
      motion. Scapular mobility and velocity were found to be key variables in shoulder 
      assessment, along with the humerus.

TI  - Accuracy and reliability of observational motion analysis in identifying shoulder 
      symptoms.
PG  - 263-70
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Aberrations in shoulder movement patterns are believed to be 
      associated with the presence of shoulder symptoms. However, the detection of 
      movement aberrations has not been rigorously investigated. It is possible that 
      manipulative physiotherapists use the clinical history to prejudge the existence 
      of aberrations, rather than the actual observation of the movement pattern 
      itself. There is a need to determine whether physiotherapists, in the absence of 
      a clinical history, can relate observed anomalies of shoulder movement to the 
      presence of symptoms and to determine the reliability for observation of such 
      anomalous shoulder movement. METHODS: The sample comprised of 9 symptomatic 
      subjects recruited from four physiotherapy clinics in Christchurch, New Zealand 
      and a further 11 asymptomatic subjects recruited from Christchurch's general 
      population. They were videotaped performing shoulder flexion, abduction, and 
      scapular plane abduction. The video-recordings were evaluated by 11 manipulative 
      physiotherapists who did not know which subjects were symptomatic and who were 
      thus required to judge the symptomatic status as: asymptomatic, symptomatic left, 
      symptomatic right or symptomatic both. Additionally, each physiotherapist 
      completed a survey on each of the 20 subjects regarding the type of movement 
      anomaly that was perceived (e.g. too much scapular elevation, too little 
      glenohumeral movement, etc). Classification accuracy (percentage of correct 
      responses) and agreement (kappa) among physiotherapists were computed. RESULTS: 
      Out of the 220 responses by the physiotherapists regarding symptomatic status, 
      58% were correct, with 68% asymptomatic, 71% symptomatic left and 30% symptomatic 
      right subjects correctly classified. Reliability analysis showed kappa statistics 
      for all subjects was 0.23, for asymptomatic subjects 0.22, symptomatic left 0.34, 
      and symptomatic right 0.17. Only five subjects had two or more evaluators agree 
      on the type of anomalous movement. CONCLUSIONS: Although movement analysis is 
      considered an integral part of a physiotherapist's skill this research has shown 
      that a sample of experienced manipulative physiotherapists had difficulty in 
      determining the symptomatic status of patients with clinically diagnosed shoulder 
      complaints by movement analysis alone.

AB  - Measurement of anterior/posterior shoulder tightness, humeral external/internal 
      rotation range of motion (ROM), scapular upward rotation/tipping ROM, and 
      functional limitations were made in 46 patients with unilateral stiff shoulders 
      (SSs) using a clinical measurement (shoulder tightness), a three-dimensional 
      electromagnetic tracking device (shoulder ROM), and self-reports of function. 
      Patients with SSs in their dominant shoulder demonstrated statistically greater 
      posterior shoulder tightness compared to nondominant shoulder. Control dominant 
      shoulders demonstrated decreased internal ROM as compared with control 
      nondominant shoulders (p=0.021). In SSs, significant relationships were found 
      between humeral internal rotation ROM and posterior shoulder tightness (R=0.49, 
      p<0.0005), humeral external rotation ROM and anterior shoulder tightness (R=0.59, 
      p=0.0002), scapular tipping and anterior shoulder tightness (R=0.57, p=0.004). 
      Specifically, in patients with dominant SSs, posterior shoulder tightness and 
      functional limitation were related (R=0.56, p=0.002). In patients with dominant 
      involved shoulders, emphasise on posterior tightness stretch may improve 
      functional ability directly. In addition to stretching program in patients with 
      SSs, internal rotation ROM of control dominant shoulder is also important to 
      consider in the rehabilitation of patients with SSs.

TI  - A simple method to directly evaluate the lateral extension of the acromion: an 
      anatomic study of 128 cadaveric scapulae.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The lateral extension of the acromion from the glenohumeral joint is 
      the critical variable that both the acromial index and critical shoulder angle 
      reflect. The purpose of this study was to establish a simple and reproducible 
      method to directly measure the lateral extension of the acromion that will be 
      independent of patient demographic characteristics, scapular rotation, or other 
      morphologic features of the shoulder. METHODS: This study used 128 unpaired 
      cadaveric scapulae with a mean age of 69.4 ± 11.1 years (66 right and 62 left 
      scapulae, 65 female and 63 male cadaveric specimens). The lateral extension of 
      the acromion was measured from the supraglenoid tubercle to the most lateral 
      point of the acromion with a digital caliper placed perpendicular to the scapula 
      long axis. This distance was called the "lateral offset of the acromion." 
      RESULTS: The lateral offset was 2.62 ± 0.72 cm in men and 2.69 ± 0.73 cm in 
      women. The offset was 2.61 ± 0.66 cm in right and 2.70 ± 0.78 cm in left 
      scapulae. The offset in the group aged 46-60 years was 2.85 ± 0.76 cm; in the 
      group aged 61-75 years, it was 2.62 ± 0.76 cm; and in the group aged 76 years or 
      older, it was 2.54 ± 0.60 cm. No significant difference was found between any of 
      the groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study established a simple method to directly 
      measure the lateral extension of the acromion based on the longitudinal axis of 
      the scapula, which eliminates bias that may exist in the acromial index and 
      critical shoulder angle from the position of the scapula and glenoid inclination. 
      The lateral offset was found to be independent of sex, side, or age, limiting 
      bias in a potential future clinical application.

TI  - An alternative definition of the scapular coordinate system for use with RSA.
PG  - 1527-31
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.01.043 [doi]
AB  - When performing radiostereometric analysis (RSA), computed tomography scans are 
      often taken to obtain the landmarks used to create anatomical coordinate systems 
      (CSs) for quantifying joint kinematics. Different conventions for defining CSs 
      lead to an inability to compare results among studies. The International Society 
      of Biomechanics (ISB) has proposed a set of CSs; however, the landmarks needed to 
      create the recommended scapular CS require the entire scapula to be scanned, 
      thereby also exposing breast and other tissues to radiation. The main purpose of 
      this work was to investigate an alternate definition of the CS that has 
      repeatably attainable landmarks and axes as close as possible to those 
      recommended by the ISB, while limiting the portion of the scapula requiring 
      scanning. Intra- and inter-investigator variabilities of landmark digitization 
      were quantified in one model of a scapula and one cadaveric specimen. Based on 
      the variability of the digitizations, an alternative CS was defined. The 
      differences between the ISB and alternative CSs were evaluated on 11 cadaveric 
      specimens. Beaded biplanar RSA was performed on the glenohumeral joint model in 
      15 different configurations and the resulting kinematics were calculated for each 
      set of landmark digitizations using both sets of coordinate systems. While the 
      kinematic angles obtained using the alternative CS were statistically different 
      from those obtained using the ISB standard, these differences were small (on the 
      order of 5 degrees) and therefore considered to be of little clinical 
      significance. In all likelihood, the benefits of decreasing radiation exposure 
      outweigh these differences in angles.

PG  - 1096-103
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2011.07.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment of glenoid inclination is of interest for a 
      variety of conditions and procedures. The purpose of this study was to develop an 
      accurate and reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on standardized 
      anterior-posterior (AP) radiographs and on computed tomography (CT) images. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three consistently identifiable angles were defined: Angle 
      α by line AB connecting the superior and inferior glenoid tubercle (glenoid 
      fossa) and the line identifying the scapular spine; angle β by line AB and the 
      floor of the supraspinatus fossa; angle γ by line AB and the lateral margin of 
      the scapula. Experimental study: these 3 angles were measured in function of the 
      scapular position to test their resistance to rotation. Conventional AP 
      radiographs and CT scans were acquired in extension/flexion and internal/external 
      rotation in a range up to ±40°. Clinical study: the inter-rater reliability of 
      all angles was assessed on AP radiographs and CT scans of 60 patients (30 with 
      proximal humeral fractures, 30 with osteoarthritis) by 2 independent observers. 
      RESULTS: The experimental study showed that angle α and β have a resistance to 
      rotation of up to ±20°. The deviation from neutral position was not more than 
      ±10°. The results for the inter-rater reliability analyzed by Bland-Altman plots 
      for the angle β fracture group were (mean ± standard deviation) -0.1 ± 4.2 for 
      radiographs and -0.3 ± 3.3 for CT scans; and for the osteoarthritis group were 
      -1.2 ± 3.8 for radiographs and -3.0 ± 3.6 for CT scans. CONCLUSION: Angle β is 
      the most reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on conventional AP 
      radiographs, providing a resistance to positional variability of the scapula and 
      a good inter-rater reliability.

TI  - Skin-fixed scapula trackers: a comparison of two dynamic methods across a range 
      of calibration positions.
PG  - 2004-7
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.05.010 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to establish the optimal methodology for skin-fixed 
      measurement of the scapula during dynamic movement. This was achieved by 
      comparing an optimally positioned Scapula Tracker device (ST) to a previously 
      described palpation device, taken as the true measure of scapular kinematics. 
      These measurements were compared across a range of calibration positions, 
      including the use of multiple calibration positions for a single movement, in 
      order to establish an optimal calibration approach. Ten subjects' scapular motion 
      was measured using this ST and a previously described Acromial Method (AM). The 
      two datasets were compared at a standard, an optimal and a 'multiple' calibration 
      position, thus allowing a direct comparison between two common skin-fixed methods 
      to track the bony kinematics of the scapula across different calibration 
      positions. A comparison was also made with a bone-fixed technique from the 
      literature. At both the standard and optimal calibration positions the ST was 
      shown to be the more accurate measure of internal rotation and posterior tilt, 
      particularly above 100° of humerothoracic elevation. The ST errors were found to 
      be acceptable in relation to clinically important levels. Calibration positions 
      have been shown to have a significant effect on the errors of both skin-fixed 
      measurement techniques and therefore the importance of correct calibration is 
      highlighted. It has thus been shown that a ST can be used to accurately quantify 
      scapular motion when appropriately calibrated for the range of motion being 
      measured.

TI  - Shoulder kinematic features using arm elevation and rotation tests for 
      classifying patients with frozen shoulder syndrome who respond to physical 
      therapy.
PG  - 544-51
AB  - Physical therapy is an intervention commonly used in the treatment of subjects 
      with frozen shoulder symptoms, with limited proven effect. The purpose of this 
      study was to identify the kinematic features of patients with frozen shoulder who 
      are more likely to respond to physical therapy. Thirty-four subjects presenting 
      frozen shoulder syndrome were studied to determine altered shoulder kinematics 
      and functional disability. Subjects received the same standardized treatment with 
      passive mobilization/stretching techniques, physical modalities (i.e. ultrasound, 
      shortwave diathermy and/or electrotherapy) and active exercises twice a week for 
      3 months. Initially, subjects were asked to perform full active motion in 3 
      tests: abduction in the scapular plane, hand-to-neck and hand-to-scapula. During 
      the test, shoulder kinematics were measured using a 3-D electromagnetic 
      motion-capturing system. In the initial and follow-up sessions, the self-reported 
      Flexilevel Scale of Shoulder Function (FLEX-SF) was used to determine functional 
      disability from symptoms. Improvement with treatment was determined using percent 
      change in FLEX-SF scores over three months of treatment [(final score-initial 
      score)/initial score x 100, >20% improvement and < = 20% nonimprovement]. 
      Shoulder kinematics were first analysed for univariate accuracy in predicting 
      improvement and then combined into a multivariate prediction method. A prediction 
      method with two variables (scapular tipping >8.4 degrees during arm elevation, 
      and external rotation >38.9 degrees during hand to neck) were identified. The 
      presence of these two variables (positive likelihood ratio=15.71) increased the 
      probability of improvement with treatment from 41% to 92%. It appears that 
      shoulder kinematics may predict improvement in subjects with frozen shoulder 
      syndrome. Prospective validation of the proposed prediction method is warranted.

TI  - Orientation and position of head posture, scapula and thoracic spine in 
      mouth-breathing children.
PG  - 227-36
LID - 10.1016/j.ijporl.2008.10.006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mouth-breathing is a common clinical condition among school-age 
      children and some studies have correlated this condition with quality of life and 
      postural alterations. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate 
      the orientation and position of the scapula, thoracic spine and head posture 
      among mouth-breathing (MB) children and nasal-breathing (NB) children. METHODS: 
      Twenty-one male MB children and 21 male NB children between 8 and 12 years of age 
      participated in the study. Data were obtained through a stereophotogrammetry 
      system that uses passive markers over anatomical landmarks to capture the 
      position of the segments. Internal rotation, upward rotation, anterior tilt, 
      scapular elevation and abduction were measured bilaterally as well as thoracic 
      kyphosis, forward head position and shoulder protrusion. RESULTS: The MB children 
      showed increased scapular superior position in relation to the NB group. No 
      statistically significant differences were found between groups regarding the 
      angular and linear measurements of the scapula. To verify reliability, three 
      measurements were taken for each variable in the study. The intraclass 
      correlation coefficient (ICC) showed results above 0.8 for all the variables 
      except for the internal rotation angle (I-Rot), below 0.5, probably due to 
      uncertainty in the palpation of the inferior angle of the scapula. Ninety-five 
      percent of the NB children and 58% among the MB children had been breastfed, this 
      difference was statistically significant. There were statistically significant 
      differences between groups regarding the domains of the Autoquestionnaire Qualité 
      de Vie Enfant Imagé (AUQEI) scale and body mass index, which was higher among the 
      NB children. CONCLUSIONS: MB children increased scapular superior position in 
      comparison to NB children due probably to the position of forward head, leading 
      to an alteration in the positioning of the mandible. The absence of significantly 
      difference in posture pattern between groups in the present study could 
      attributed to height-weight development in this age, as the posture of children 
      changes in order to adapt to new body proportions, regardless of health status. 
      The results observed in this study demonstrate the importance of using reliable 
      measurements in the postural assessment of MB and NB children helping physical 
      therapists to focus their strategies during rehabilitation in more specific 
      conditions.

TI  - Prediction of joint center location by customizable multiple regressions: 
      application to clavicle, scapula and humerus.
PG  - 319-24
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2008.11.004 [doi]
AB  - Accurate spatial location of joint center (JC) is a key issue in motion analysis 
      since JC locations are used to define standardized anatomical frames, in which 
      results are represented. Accurate and reproducible JC location is important for 
      data comparison and data exchange. This paper presents a method for JC locations 
      based on the multiple regression algorithms without preliminary assumption on the 
      behavior of the joint-of-interest. Regression equations were obtained from 
      manually palpable ALs on each bone-of-interest. Results are presented for all 
      joint surfaces found on the clavicle, scapula and humeral bone. Mean accuracy 
      errors on the JC locations obtained on dry bones were 5.2+/-2.5 mm for the 
      humeral head, 2.5+/-1.1 mm for the humeral trochlea, 2.3+/-0.9 mm for the humeral 
      capitulum, 8.2+/-3.9 mm for the scapula glenoid cavity, 7.2+/-3.2 mm for the 
      scapular aspect of the acromio-clavicular joint, 3.5+/-1.8mm for the clavicular 
      aspect of the sternoclavicular joint and 3.2+/-1.4 mm for the clavicular aspect 
      of the acromio-clavicular joint. In-vitro and in-vivo validation accuracy was 5.3 
      and 8.5mm, respectively, for the humeral head center location. Regression 
      coefficients for joint radius dimension and joint surface orientation were also 
      processed and reported in this paper.

TI  - Moment arms of the shoulder muscles during axial rotation.
PG  - 658-67
LID - 10.1002/jor.21269 [doi]
AB  - The objective of the present study was to determine the instantaneous moment arms 
      of 18 major muscle sub-regions crossing the glenohumeral joint in axial rotation 
      of the humerus during coronal-plane abduction and sagittal-plane flexion. The 
      tendon-excursion method was used to measure instantaneous muscle moment arms in 
      eight entire upper-extremity cadaver specimens. The results showed that the 
      inferior subscapularis was the largest internal rotator; its rotation moment arm 
      peaks were 24.4 and 27.0 mm during abduction and flexion, respectively. The 
      inferior infraspinatus and teres minor were the greatest external rotators; their 
      respective rotation moment arms peaked at 28.3 and 26.5 mm during abduction, and 
      23.3 and 22.1 mm during flexion. The two supraspinatus sub-regions were external 
      rotators during abduction and internal rotators during flexion. The latissimus 
      dorsi and pectoralis major behaved as internal rotators throughout both abduction 
      and flexion, with the three pectoralis major sub-regions and middle and inferior 
      latissimus dorsi displaying significantly larger internal rotation moment arms 
      with the humerus adducted or flexed than when abducted or extended (p < 0.001). 
      The deltoid behaved either as an internal rotator or an external rotator, 
      depending on the degree of humeral abduction and axial rotation. Knowledge of 
      moment arm differences between muscle sub-regions may assist in identifying the 
      functional effects of muscle sub-region tears, assist surgeons in planning tendon 
      transfer surgery, and aid in the development and validation of biomechanical 
      computer models.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the intra- and interrater reliability and agreement 
      for field-based assessment of scapular control, shoulder range of motion (ROM), 
      and shoulder isometric strength in elite youth athletes. DESIGN: Test-retest 
      reliability and agreement study. SETTING: Eight blinded raters (two for each 
      assessment) assessed players on field during two testing sessions separated by 
      one week. PARTICIPANTS: 162 elite youth handball players with or without a 
      history of previous shoulder pain within the preceding six months. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Kappa (κ) and prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) 
      coefficients for scapular control reliability, and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) 
      for ROM and strength agreement. RESULTS: Scapular control demonstrated 
      substantial to almost perfect reliability (κ 0.67 to 0.84, PABAK from 0.68 to 
      0.88). Mean strength values ranged from 0.9 N/kg to 1.6 N/kg, and LOAs ranged 
      from -0.7 N/kg to 0.8 N/kg. Rotational strength revealed additionally systematic 
      bias between and within rater. No or acceptable systematic bias were evident for 
      ROM and abduction strength measures. Mean values and LOAs for ROM ranged between 
      39.9° to 52.3°, and from -12.6° to 9.9°, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Scapular 
      control and ROM can be assessed on the field with acceptable reliability. The 
      threshold for reliable measurements of isometric strength using 
      handheld-dynamometers is high.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS AND BACKGROUND: Posterior shoulder tightness (PST) has been linked to 
      numerous shoulder pathologies in both the general and athletic populations. 
      Several methods for documenting PST have been described in the literature, which 
      may lend to variability in clinical practice and research. The purpose of this 
      study was to perform a systematic review with meta-analysis to investigate the 
      reliability, validity, and methodologic quality of methods used to quantify PST. 
      METHODS: Relevant studies were assessed for inclusion, and selected studies were 
      identified from the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to 
      Nursing and Allied Health Literature) databases. Data were extracted from the 
      selected studies and underwent methodologic quality assessment and meta-analysis. 
      RESULTS: The search resulted in 1006 studies identified, with 18 ultimately 
      retained. Intrarater reliability was reported in 12 studies with a summary 
      intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.90-0.95), 
      whereas inter-rater reliability was reported in 6 studies with a summary 
      intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.94). 
      Validity was reported in 10 studies, all using internal rotation as the 
      convergent standard, and was found to be significant in all but 1 study. 
      CONCLUSION: Current methods used to quantify PST have good reliability but are 
      primarily limited to measures of horizontal adduction of the glenohumeral joint 
      with scapular stabilization. Limitations in using a single measurement technique 
      exist particularly as there may be multiple contributing factors to PST. A more 
      comprehensive approach for quantifying PST is necessary, and suggested components 
      include a cluster of techniques composed of horizontal adduction, internal 
      rotation, and total glenohumeral joint range of motion.

TI  - Limitations of isokinetic testing to determine shoulder strength after rotator 
      cuff repair.
PG  - 141-4
AB  - Some investigators have reported incomplete data when using isokinetic testing as 
      a means of analyzing shoulder strength after rotator cuff repair. An explanation 
      provided has been that the subjects could not reach the speed at which the 
      machine was set. The purpose of this study was to determine if strength data 
      could be generated for all motions being tested by using not only the one or two 
      speeds employed by others, but three speeds across the spectrum of those 
      available. Inclusion criteria were a minimum of two years since surgery with a 
      normal contralateral shoulder. All eligible subjects had isokinetic testing of 
      the non-operated shoulder followed by the operated shoulder, in flexion, 
      abduction and external rotation, tested at 60 degrees, 120 degrees and 180 
      degrees per second. Fourteen patients were eligible and tested. Isokinetic data 
      showed deficiencies in strength in the operated shoulder compared to the opposite 
      side for abduction, external rotation and flexion of 14%, 27% and 20% 
      respectively. In 10/123 (8%) of the tests, the patients could not reach the 
      preset velocity to yield valid data. One patient could not place and maintain the 
      operated arm in the test position of 90 degrees of shoulder abduction. There was 
      a significant deficiency in abduction at only one of three speeds. This study 
      confirms that isokinetic testing is a powerful tool that lends itself well to 
      producing objective data on shoulder strength after rotator cuff repair, but it 
      also has the limitation that some patients cannot reach the preset velocity for 
      some motions, or place and maintain the operated arm in the test position for the 
      movements being tested. Therefore, to optimize the chances of obtaining 
      isokinetic data for all movements after rotator cuff repair, we suggest using 
      speeds for all motions and consideration of scapular, frontal and sagittal planes 
      for testing.

TI  - Correlation of glenohumeral internal rotation deficit and total rotational motion 
      to shoulder injuries in professional baseball pitchers.
PG  - 329-35
LID - 10.1177/0363546510384223 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) indicates a 20° or 
      greater loss of internal rotation of the throwing shoulder compared with the 
      nondominant shoulder. PURPOSE: To determine whether GIRD and a deficit in total 
      rotational motion (external rotation + internal rotation) compared with the 
      nonthrowing shoulder correlate with shoulder injuries in professional baseball 
      pitchers. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Over 3 
      competitive seasons (2005 to 2007), passive range of motion measurements were 
      evaluated on the dominant and nondominant shoulders for 170 pitcher-seasons. This 
      included 122 professional pitchers during the 3 seasons of data collection, in 
      which some pitchers were measured during multiple seasons. Ranges of motion were 
      measured with a bubble goniometer during the preseason, by the same examiner each 
      year. External and internal rotation of the glenohumeral joint was assessed with 
      the participant supine and the arm abducted 90° in the plane of the scapula, with 
      the scapula stabilized anteriorly at the coracoid process. The reproducibility of 
      the test methods had an intraclass correlation coefficient of .81. Days in which 
      the player was unable to participate because of injury or surgery were recorded 
      during the season by the medical staff of the team and defined as an injury. 
      RESULTS: Pitchers with GIRD (n = 40) were nearly twice as likely to be injured as 
      those without but without statistical significance (P = .17). Pitchers with total 
      rotational motion deficit greater than 5° had a higher rate of injury. Minor 
      league pitchers were more likely than major league pitchers to be injured. 
      However, when players were injured, major league pitchers missed a significantly 
      greater number of games than minor league pitchers. CONCLUSION: Compared with 
      pitchers without GIRD, pitchers with GIRD appear to be at a higher risk for 
      injury and shoulder surgery.

TI  - Dominant vs. non-dominant shoulder morphology in volleyball players and 
      associations with shoulder pain and spike speed.
PG  - 65-73
AB  - The aims of our study were to compare the dominant (DOM) and non-dominant (NDOM) 
      shoulders of high-level volleyball athletes and identify possible associations of 
      shoulder adaptations with spike speed (SS) and shoulder pathology. A total of 22 
      male volleyball players from two teams participating in the first division of the 
      Cypriot championship underwent clinical shoulder tests and simple measurements 
      around their shoulder girdle joints bilaterally. SS was measured with the use of 
      a sports speed radar. Compared with the NDOM side, the DOM scapula was more 
      lateralised, the DOM dorsal capsule demonstrated greater laxity, the DOM dorsal 
      muscles stretching ability was compromised, and the DOM pectoralis muscle was 
      more lengthened. Players with present or past DOM shoulder pain demonstrated 
      greater laxity in their DOM dorsal capsule, tightening of their DOM inferior 
      capsule, and lower SS compared with those without shoulder pain. Dorsal capsule 
      measurements bilaterally were significant predictors of SS. None of the shoulder 
      measurements was associated with team roles or infraspinatus atrophy, while 
      scapular lateralisation was more pronounced with increasing years of experience, 
      and scapular antetilting was greater with increasing age. Adaptations of the DOM 
      shoulder may be linked to pathology and performance. We describe simple shoulder 
      measurements that may have the potential to predict chronic shoulder injury and 
      become part of injury prevention programmes. Detailed biomechanical and large 
      prospective studies are warranted to assess the validity of our findings and 
      reach more definitive conclusions.

TI  - In vivo estimation of the glenohumeral joint centre by functional methods: 
      accuracy and repeatability assessment.
PG  - 370-4
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.09.029 [doi]
AB  - Several algorithms have been proposed for determining the centre of rotation of 
      ball joints. These algorithms are used rather to locate the hip joint centre. Few 
      studies have focused on the determination of the glenohumeral joint centre. 
      However, no studies have assessed the accuracy and repeatability of functional 
      methods for glenohumeral joint centre. This paper aims at evaluating the accuracy 
      and the repeatability with which the glenohumeral joint rotation centre (GHRC) 
      can be estimated in vivo by functional methods. The reference joint centre is the 
      glenohumeral anatomical centre obtained by medical imaging. Five functional 
      methods were tested: the algorithm of Gamage and Lasenby (2002), bias compensated 
      (Halvorsen, 2003), symmetrical centre of rotation estimation (Ehrig et al., 
      2006), normalization method (Chang and Pollard, 2007), helical axis (Woltring et 
      al., 1985). The glenohumeral anatomical centre (GHAC) was deduced from the 
      fitting of the humeral head. Four subjects performed three cycles of three 
      different movements (flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and circumduction). 
      For each test, the location of the glenohumeral joint centre was estimated by the 
      five methods. Analyses focused on the 3D location, on the repeatability of 
      location and on the accuracy by computing the Euclidian distance between the 
      estimated GHRC and the GHAC. For all the methods, the error repeatability was 
      inferior to 8.25 mm. This study showed that there are significant differences 
      between the five functional methods. The smallest distance between the estimated 
      joint centre and the centre of the humeral head was obtained with the method of 
      Gamage and Lasenby (2002).

TI  - Is There a Decrease in the Acromiohumeral Distance Among Recreational Overhead 
      Athletes With Rotator Cuff-Related Shoulder Pain?
PG  - 531-537
LID - jsr.2020-0170 [pii]
LID - 10.1123/jsr.2020-0170 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Recreational overhead athletes are exposed to high overload, which 
      increases the risk of shoulder injuries. Reduction of the acromiohumeral distance 
      (AHD) is often associated with rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (RCRSP) among 
      the general population. However, the AHD of symptomatic shoulders of recreational 
      athletes has not yet been compared with their asymptomatic shoulders. OBJECTIVE: 
      To compare the AHD of a symptomatic to asymptomatic shoulder at rest (0°) and 60° 
      abduction. To establish the relationship between AHD, pain, and functional 
      limitations of recreational athletes with RCRSP. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. 
      SETTING: University laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 45 recreational overhead 
      athletes with RCRSP were examined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The AHD was measured by 
      ultrasonography at 0° and 60° abduction (angles). Shoulder pain was assessed 
      using a numeric pain scale, whereas functional limitations were assessed using 
      the The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire. Differences in 
      the between-shoulders condition (symptomatic and asymptomatic) were determined 
      using 2-way analysis of variance for repeated measures. A Pearson correlation 
      established the relationship between AHD, pain, and functional limitations. 
      RESULTS: No angles × shoulder condition interactions (P = .776) nor shoulder 
      condition effects (P = .087) were detected, suggesting no significant differences 
      (P > .05) between asymptomatic and symptomatic shoulders in the AHD at 0° or 60°. 
      The AHD at 60° reduced significantly compared with 0° (3.05 [1.36] mm 
      [2.77-3.33], angle effects: P < .001). The AHD at 0° and 60° was not correlated 
      with pain or functional limitations (-.205 ≤ r ≤ .210, .167 ≤ P ≤ .585). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The AHD of recreational athletes is not decreased in symptomatic 
      shoulders compared with asymptomatic shoulders. Reduction of the AHD in 
      symptomatic shoulders is not associated with an increase in pain or functional 
      limitations of recreational athletes with RCRSP.

TI  - Glenohumeral joint internal and external rotation range of motion in elite junior 
      tennis players.
PG  - 336-41
AB  - Objective measurement of range of motion of the glenohumeral joint is important 
      for the rehabilitation and prevention of shoulder injury. The primary purpose of 
      this study was to determine whether significant differences exist between the 
      dominant (tennis playing) and nondominant extremity in active internal and 
      external rotation range of motion in elite junior tennis players 11-17 years of 
      age. Two hundred three elite junior tennis players (113 males, 90 females) were 
      bilaterally measured for internal and external rotation at 90 degrees of 
      abduction in a supine position with a specific methodology attempting to isolate 
      glenohumeral motion, while minimizing or negating scapulothoracic motion. A 
      standard universal goniometer was utilized to measure active range of motion 
      (AROM). Dependent t tests were used to compare differences between extremities. 
      No significant difference was found for males or females between the dominant and 
      nondominant arm in external rotation. Analysis of internal rotation (AROM) 
      differences showed significantly less (p < .001) internal rotation (AROM) on the 
      dominant arm for both males and females. Significantly less (p < .001) dominant 
      arm total rotational range of motion was also found in both males and females. 
      The loss of dominant arm internal rotation (AROM) has clinical application for 
      both the development of rehabilitation and preventative flexibility/range of 
      motion programs.

TI  - [Impingement syndrome of the shoulder. Clinical data and radiologic findings].
PG  - 18-21
AB  - Subcoracoid impingement syndrome pain is elicited by some positions of the upper 
      limbs, i.e., adduction and inward rotation, whenever coracohumeral space reduces. 
      Although acquired or congenital malformations of the humeral head and/or coracoid 
      apophysis are the most common causes of painful syndromes, repeated flections and 
      inward rotations of the upper limbs, typical of some sports, such as swimming and 
      tennis, and of some sports, such as swimming and tennis, and of some kinds of 
      work, are predisposing factors. The subcoracoid impingement syndrome exhibits on 
      pathogenomonic signs at clinics and the specificity of diagnostic methods is low, 
      which calls for reliable radiologic assessment of this condition. Fifteen 
      patients with subcoracoid impingement syndrome underwent X-ray, US, CT and MR 
      studies. Plain radiography detected no specific signs of this syndrome, but 
      yielded useful information regarding other painful syndromes of the shoulder, 
      such as anatomical variants of the acromion and degenerative changes. US yield 
      was poor because of the acoustic window of the coracoid apophysis, but 
      supraspinatus tendon changes were demonstrated in 2 cases. CT and MRI proved to 
      be the most reliable and accurate diagnostic methods, the former thanks to its 
      sensitivity to even slight bone changes and to its capabilities in measuring 
      coracohumeral distance and acquiring dynamic scans and the latter because it 
      detects tendon, bursa and rotator cuff changes. To conclude, in our opinion, when 
      the subcoracoid impingement syndrome is clinically suspected, plain X-ray films 
      should be performed first and followed by MR scans.

TI  - Bony adaptation of the proximal humerus and glenoid correlate within the throwing 
      shoulder of professional baseball pitchers.
PG  - 1858-62
LID - 10.1177/0363546512452720 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elite throwing athletes have increased proximal humeral retrotorsion 
      (HRT) and glenoid retroversion (GRV) in their throwing shoulders compared with 
      their nonthrowing shoulders. These adaptive morphologic changes are thought to be 
      independently protective against shoulder injury; however, their relationship to 
      each other is poorly understood. PURPOSE: To determine if an association exists 
      between HRT and GRV within the same shoulders of professional pitchers. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The HRT and GRV 
      measurements were determined using published techniques in asymptomatic bilateral 
      shoulders of 32 professional pitchers (mean age, 23 years). Three measurements 
      for each variable were averaged, and the reliability of the techniques was 
      verified. The relationship between HRT and GRV within the same shoulders was 
      determined with Pearson correlation coefficients. Paired t tests were used to 
      compare HRT and GRV between the throwing and nonthrowing shoulder. Simple ratios 
      were calculated between HRT and GRV. RESULTS: Humeral retrotorsion and GRV were 
      both significantly greater on the throwing side compared with the nonthrowing 
      side (HRT: throwing = 9.0° ± 11.4° and nonthrowing = 22.1° ± 10.7°, P < .001; 
      GRV: throwing = 8.6° ± 6.0° and nonthrowing = 4.9° ± 4.8°, P = .001). Within the 
      same shoulders, there was a statistically significant positive association 
      between HRT and GRV on the throwing side (r = 0.43, P = .016) but not on the 
      nonthrowing side (r = -0.13, P = .50). The HRT:GRV ratio was 2.3:1 for throwing 
      shoulders and 7:1 for nonthrowing shoulders. CONCLUSION: The concurrent increases 
      in dominant shoulder HRT and GRV were observed as a 2:1 "thrower's ratio." As 
      this relationship was not observed on the nondominant shoulder, it suggests that 
      bony adaptation of the proximal humerus and glenoid are coupled during skeletal 
      development in the throwing shoulder. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm 
      this hypothesis.

TI  - The Reliability of Strength Tests Performed In Elevated Shoulder Positions Using 
      a Handheld Dynamometer.
LID - 2015-0034 [pii]
LID - 10.1123/jsr.2015-0034 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The reliable measurement of shoulder strength is important when 
      assessing athletes involved in overhead activities. Swimmers' shoulders are 
      subject to repetitive humeral elevation and consequently have a high risk of 
      developing movement-control issues and pain. Shoulder-strength tests performed in 
      positions of elevation assist with the detection of strength deficits that may 
      affect injury and performance. The reliability of isometric strength tests 
      performed in positions of humeral elevation without manual stabilization, which 
      is a typical clinical scenario, has not been established. OBJECTIVE: To establish 
      the relative and absolute intrarater reliability of shoulder-strength tests 
      functional to swimming in 3 body positions commonly used in the clinical setting. 
      DESIGN: Repeated-measures reliability study. SETTING: Research laboratory. 
      SUBJECTS: 15 university students and staff (mean ± SD age 24 ± 8.2 y). 
      INTERVENTION: Isometric shoulder-strength tests were performed in positions of 
      humeral elevation (flexion and extension in 140° abduction in the scapular plane, 
      internal and external rotation in 90° abduction) on subjects without shoulder 
      pain in supine, prone, and sitting. Subjects were tested by 1 examiner with a 
      handheld dynamometer and retested after 48 h. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative 
      reliability (ICC3,1) values with 95% CI. Absolute reliability was reported by 
      minimal detectable change (MDC). RESULTS: Good to excellent intrarater 
      reliability was found for all shoulder-strength tests (ICC .87-.99). Intrarater 
      reliability was not affected by body position. MDC% was <16% for every test and 
      ≤11% for tests performed in supine. CONCLUSIONS: Shoulder flexion, extension, and 
      internal- and external-rotation strength tests performed in humeral elevation 
      demonstrated excellent to good intrarater reliability regardless of body 
      position. A strength change of more than 15% in any position can be considered 
      meaningful.

TI  - External rotation and active supination CT arthrography for the postoperative 
      evaluation of type II superior labral anterior to posterior lesions.
PG  - 134-40
LID - 10.1007/s00167-014-3350-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of external rotation and active supination 
      CT arthrography in postoperative evaluation by comparing it with neutral CT 
      arthrography and analyzing its agreement with postoperative clinical results 
      after the repair of type II superior labral anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 patients who had undergone CT arthrography 
      in neutral, external rotation and active supination position at least 1 year 
      after the arthroscopic repair of SLAP lesions were enrolled. Two radiologists 
      independently evaluated the status of the repaired SLAP lesions with neutral CT 
      arthrography and then with external rotation and active supination CT 
      arthrography. RESULTS: Five patients had residual symptoms and positive findings 
      upon SLAP-specific examinations. Agreements between the presence of symptoms and 
      radiologic diagnoses based on neutral CT arthrography were insignificant for 
      reader 1 (κ = 0.138, p = n.s.) and significant for reader 2 (κ = 0.328, p = 
      0.027). However, agreements were highly significant in the analysis following the 
      evaluation of external rotation and active supination CT arthrography for both 
      readers (κ = 0.694, p < 0.001 in reader 1; κ = 0.783, p < 0.001 in reader 2). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The presence of contrast-filled gaps between the labrum and glenoid 
      on neutral CT arthrography after SLAP repair is frequent with satisfactory 
      clinical outcomes. Gaps without additional widening upon external rotation and 
      active supination CT arthrography may suggest postoperatively stable biceps 
      anchors, so this new method could minimize the overdiagnosis of recurrent SLAP 
      lesions. Additional gap widening on external rotation and active supination CT 
      arthrography could be related to a true recurrent SLAP lesion and the symptoms of 
      the patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Case series, Level IV.

TI  - The position of the rotation center of the glenohumeral joint.
PG  - 1711-5
AB  - To validate the assumption that the center of rotation in the glenohumeral (GH) 
      joint can be described based on the geometry of the joint, two methods for 
      calculation of the GH rotation center were compared. These are a kinematic 
      estimation based on the calculation of instantaneous helical axes, and a 
      geometric estimation based on a spherical fit through the surface of the glenoid. 
      Four fresh cadaver arms were fixed at the scapula and fitted with electromagnetic 
      sensors. Each arm was moved in different directions while at the same time the 
      orientation of the humerus was recorded. Subsequently, each specimen was 
      dissected and its glenoid and humeral head surfaces were digitized. Results 
      indicate no differences between the methods. It is concluded that the method to 
      estimate the GH center of rotation as the center of a sphere through the glenoid 
      surface, with the radius of the humeral head, appears to be valid.

TI  - Difference of Critical Shoulder Angle (CSA) According to Minimal Rotation: Can 
      Minimal Rotation of the Scapula Be Allowed in the Evaluation of CSA?
PG  - 309-315
LID - 10.4055/cios.2019.11.3.309 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimal rotation of the scapula may affect the measurement of 
      critical shoulder angle (CSA). We investigated the difference in the CSA measured 
      in minimal rotation between the patients with rotator cuff tear and those without 
      non-rotator cuff tear and the CSA measurement error by comparing with computed 
      tomography (CT). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with 
      full-thickness rotator cuff tear and whose X-ray views correspond to 
      Suter-Henninger classification type A1 and C1. The CSA values between the normal 
      control group (without rotator cuff tear) and the rotator cuff tear group were 
      compared according to A1 type and C1 type. In the rotator cuff tear group, we 
      compared the CSA values measured by using X-ray and CT. RESULTS: A total of 238 
      patients (rotator cuff tear group, 139 patients; normal cuff group, 99 patients) 
      were included in this study. The mean CSA of the rotator cuff tear group was 
      33.4° ± 3.5°, and that of the normal cuff group was 32.6° ± 3.9° (p = 0.085). On 
      comparison of the CSA according to the Suter-Henninger classification type, the 
      CSA values on the A1 type view and C1 type view were 32.7° ± 3.5° and 33.7° ± 
      3.5°, respectively, in the rotator cuff tear group and 30.5° ± 3.1° and 33.1 ± 
      3.9°, respectively, in the normal cuff group (p = 0.024 and p = 0.216, 
      respectively). The mean CSA was 32.5° ± 3.1° in CT and 33.3° ± 3.2° in X-ray (p = 
      0.184). On comparison of the CSA according to the Suter-Henninger classification 
      type, the CSA values on the A1 type view and C1 type view were 32.6° ± 3.6° and 
      32.5° ± 2.4°, respectively, in CT and 32.5° ± 3.5° and 34.2° ± 2.6°, 
      respectively, in X-ray (p = 0.905 and p = 0.017, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      X-ray view corresponding to Suter-Henninger classification type A1 or 
      CT-reconstructed image can be used to reduce the measurement error and obtain 
      reliable CSA values. The CSA measured on the X-ray view corresponding to 
      Suter-Henninger classification type A1 may be related with rotator cuff tear.

TI  - Influence of the side of brain damage on postural upper-limb control including 
      the scapula in stroke patients.
PG  - 141-55
LID - 10.1007/s00221-012-3014-y [doi]
AB  - Following stroke, control of both the contralesional (paretic) and ipsilesional 
      (less affected) arms is altered. The purpose of this study was to analyse the 
      consequences of stroke on joint rotations of both shoulder girdles, that is, 
      glenohumeral (GH) and scapula motion. Because of hemispheric specialization, we 
      hypothesized that changes would relate to the side of hemisphere damage. Nine 
      stroke patients with left, and 9 with right hemisphere damage (LHD and RHD) and 9 
      healthy subjects were included. Reaching movements to targets positioned close, 
      far and high in three directions were recorded using an electromagnetic system. 
      Initial and final postures of the scapula, GH and elbow joint were evaluated. 
      Inter-joint rotations throughout the movements were analysed using principal 
      component analysis (PCA). The main finding was that initial and final postures of 
      the contralesional and ipsilesional shoulders differed depending on the side of 
      brain lesion. On the contralesional side, there was less scapula protraction and 
      GH lateral rotation for both groups. Scapula tilt was less anterior in LHD 
      patients, and GH elevation was greater in RHD patients. On the ipsilesional side, 
      GH lateral rotation was reduced in both groups, and scapula protraction was 
      reduced only for LHD patients. PCA confirmed that postures of both shoulders of 
      the LHD group were substantially different to the healthy subjects, while only 
      the contralesional arm of the RHD subjects differed. These results add to 
      existing knowledge of hemispheric specialization, suggesting that the left 
      hemisphere plays a greater role in bilateral joint postures than the right 
      hemisphere.

TI  - A novel treatment of grade III acromioclavicular joint dislocations with a C-hook 
      implant.
PG  - 22-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study evaluates the results of the new surgical treatment of 
      complete acromioclavicular (ac) dislocations using coracoclavicular (cc) fixation 
      with a shape memory metal C-hook implant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients 
      were prospectively analyzed. They all had a Tossy III ac dislocation due to 
      trauma. The ac ligament was reinserted using a surgical bone anchor, and the 
      position of the joint was restored by fixing it with a C-hook. After 3 months the 
      C-hook was removed. Functional status, symptom severity, X-rays and patient 
      satisfaction were analyzed during clinical control visits. The follow-up time was 
      1 year. RESULTS: At 12 weeks, full shoulder function had been achieved by 93% of 
      the patients. The final control visit showed full recovery of active ROM in all 
      patients. Two patients had mild pain during certain movements. X-rays showed the 
      precise anatomical position of ac joint with no statistically significant 
      differences compared to the healthy side. Patient contentment was excellent in 14 
      cases and satisfactory in one case. The average sick-leave was 58 days, including 
      the removal operation. Minor osteolysis of the clavicle was noticed in two 
      patients. CONCLUSION: The new C-hook implant provides accurate anatomical 
      reduction, conserves the articular surfaces and enables fast functional recovery 
      with excellent patient contentment. Technically, the implant is easy to use. 
      Based on this study, the C-hook presents a reliable novel treatment option in 
      surgical ac repair.

TI  - Effect of scapular pillar anatomy on scapular impingement in adduction and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Notching of the scapular pillar is the main radiographic complication 
      seen during follow-up of reverse shoulder arthroplasties. Several recommendations 
      pertaining to the implantation technique and glenoid component design have been 
      suggested. No studies have investigated potential anatomic risk factors for 
      inferior scapular impingement. HYPOTHESIS: A specific anatomic shape of the 
      scapular pillar promotes the development of notching. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 
      Aequalis Reversed(®) (Tornier Inc., Edina, MN, USA) prosthesis was implanted into 
      40 cadaver scapulae. We measured maximal range-of-motion (ROM) in internal 
      rotation, external rotation, and adduction. The anatomic specimens were then 
      imaged using two-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and the scapular neck 
      angle, surface area under the scapular pillar, and distance from the central 
      glenosphere peg to the inferior glenoid rim were measured. Associations between 
      these CT parameters and ROM values were assessed using statistical independence 
      tests. RESULTS: ROM values were greatest when the surface area under the scapular 
      pillar was above 0.8 cm(2) (P<0.5). This feature combined with a scapular neck 
      angle less than 105° produced the largest ROM values (P<0.5). DISCUSSION: The 
      scapular neck angle alone is not sufficient to identify a scapular morphology 
      that increases the risk of notching. The surface area under the scapular pillar, 
      in contrast, discriminates between scapulae with and without a high risk of 
      notching. The surface area under the scapular pillar is influenced by the 
      inferior glenoid offset. CONCLUSION: We were unable to define a specific scapular 
      shape at high risk for notching. The prevention of notching should rely chiefly 
      on a rigorous glenoid component implantation technique, with particular attention 
      to the inferior offset. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, experimental study.

TI  - Effect of selective experimental suprascapular nerve block on abduction and 
      external rotation strength of the shoulder.
PG  - 815-20
AB  - The relative contribution to strength of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus to 
      abduction and external rotation is not precisely known. Optimal testing positions 
      for clinical assessment of supraspinatus and infraspinatus function are not 
      precisely defined. We sequentially performed electromyographically controlled, 
      complete nerve blocks of the suprascapular nerve, first at the spinoglenoid 
      notch, to induce complete, isolated infraspinatus palsy. The suprascapular nerve 
      was then blocked at the scapular notch, resulting in complete supraspinatus and 
      infraspinatus palsy in 11 volunteers. Strength of abduction in the scapular plane 
      and of external rotation was measured at 0 degrees , 30 degrees , 60 degrees , 
      and 90 degrees of abduction, by use of a validated, instrumented 
      strength-measuring device. Complete isolated infraspinatus palsy was obtained in 
      11 volunteers and complete combined supraspinatus and infraspinatus palsy in 9. 
      Infraspinatus palsy alone led to a loss of approximately 70% of external rotation 
      strength and approximately 45% of abduction strength. The degree of loss of 
      strength was not dependent on the angle of abduction. Paralysis of the 
      infraspinatus and the supraspinatus led to a loss of external rotator strength of 
      approximately 80% and a loss of abductor strength of approximately 75%. The loss 
      was again independent of the angle of abduction at which the testing took place. 
      Testing of supraspinatus and infraspinatus strength can be performed at any angle 
      between 30 degrees and 90 degrees without a change in specificity. The 
      contribution of the infraspinatus to abduction strength is great. In the acute 
      situation, the teres minor does not contribute more than 20% of external rotation 
      strength at any degree of abduction.

TI  - The anterior borders of the clavicle and the acromion are not always aligned in 
      the intact acromioclavicular joint: a cadaveric study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to find reliable anatomic landmarks of the 
      normal acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) that could enable the precise evaluation of 
      the horizontal displacement of the clavicle after dislocation. The hypothesis was 
      that the anterior borders of the acromion and the clavicle are always aligned in 
      intact ACJs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 30 cadaveric specimens, the anterior and 
      posterior borders of the ACJ's articular facets and the most prominent anterior 
      and posterior bony landmarks of the acromion and the clavicle were identified. 
      The anterior and posterior overhang of the acromion and the clavicle was measured 
      in relation to the borders of the articular facets. Therefore, the possible 
      anterior and posterior alignment of the ACJ was evaluated. RESULTS: Anteriorly, 
      only 18 ACJs (60%) were aligned whereas 7 (24%) had major overhang of the 
      acromion and 3 (10%) had major overhang of the clavicle. Similarly, 18 cases 
      (60%) were posteriorly aligned, whereas 6 (20%) had major clavicular overhang and 
      4 (14%) had major overhang of the acromion. In 78% of these cases, the ACJ was 
      aligned as well anteriorly as posteriorly (P < .001). Finally, the larger the 
      width of the acromion (P = .032) or the clavicle (P = .049), the better the 
      posterior joint alignment. CONCLUSION: Our hypothesis was not verified. The 
      acromion and clavicle are not perfectly aligned in a significant number of 
      specimens with intact ACJs (40% of cases). The most reliable landmarks remain 
      their articular facets.

TI  - The effect of shoulder movements on thoracic spine 3D motion.
PG  - 418-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there is any repeatable coupling pattern of 
      upper thoracic movements, during right arm elevation in sagittal and scapular 
      plane. METHODS: Upper thoracic movement patterns (T2-T7) were examined during 
      right arm elevation, in the sagittal and scapular plane using an electromagnetic 
      device. The participants were 25 asymptomatic woman aged between 45 and 64 years. 
      RESULTS: The majority of the participants performed an ipsilateral coupling 
      pattern between lateral flexion and rotation which was repeatable and comparable 
      for both arm elevation planes. Ipsilateral coupling of right lateral flexion and 
      rotation in association with extension occurred in 23 subjects during arm 
      elevation in sagittal plane, and in 19 subjects during arm elevation in scapular 
      plane. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis revealed that the participants demonstrated a 
      repeatable upper thoracic movement pattern within and between subjects, during 
      arm elevation in sagittal and scapular planes. RELEVANCE: The biomechanical 
      relationship between the arm and the thoracic spine is important to clinical 
      practice because of the contribution of spinal to shoulder movements and vice 
      versa, in the recognition, prevention and restoration of musculoskeletal 
      function.

TI  - Finite element analysis of the mechanical behavior of a scapula implanted with a 
      glenoid prosthesis.
PG  - 566-75
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to analyze the mechanical 
      effect of some of the surgical variables encountered during shoulder arthroplasty 
      using the finite element method. The effect of one eccentric load case, cement 
      thickness and conformity has been investigated. DESIGN: A 3D finite element model 
      of a healthy cadaveric scapula implanted with an anatomically shaped glenoid has 
      been developed from computed tomography (CT) images. BACKGROUND: Glenoid 
      component fixation can present the most difficult problem in total shoulder 
      arthroplasty, loosening of this component remains one of the main complications. 
      METHODS: The 3D finite element model was first validated by comparison with 
      experimental measurements and by fitting of the mechanical properties of the 
      cortical bone. Then the articular pressure location, the surface contact geometry 
      and the cement thickness have been analyzed to observe their effect on stresses 
      and displacements at the interfaces and within the scapular bone. RESULTS: The 
      antero-posterior bending of the scapula was a notable feature and this was 
      accentuated when an eccentric load was applied. The gleno-humeral contact area 
      had a major role on the stress level in the supporting structures though but not 
      on the global displacements. Varying the cement mantle modified stresses 
      according to the load case and it essentially changed the latero-medial 
      displacement of the cement relatively to the bone. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis 
      provided an insight into the mechanical effects of an implanted scapula according 
      to different parameters related to implantation technique. RELEVANCE: Results 
      emphasized the role of some of the parameters a clinician may face. They 
      demonstrated the importance of the humeral head centering in the horizontal 
      plane. Conformity decreasing may involve drastic increase of stresses within 
      structures and a thick cement mantle is not necessarily advantageous relatively 
      to the stresses at the cement/bone interface.

TI  - The effect of decreasing computed tomography dosage on radiostereometric analysis 
      (RSA) accuracy at the glenohumeral joint.
PG  - 2847-50
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.08.009 [doi]
AB  - Standard, beaded radiostereometric analysis (RSA) and markerless RSA often use 
      computed tomography (CT) scans to create three-dimensional (3D) bone models. 
      However, ethical concerns exist due to risks associated with CT radiation 
      exposure. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 
      decreasing CT dosage on RSA accuracy. Four cadaveric shoulder specimens were 
      scanned using a normal-dose CT protocol and two low-dose protocols, where the 
      dosage was decreased by 89% and 98%. 3D computer models of the humerus and 
      scapula were created using each CT protocol. Bi-planar fluoroscopy was used to 
      image five different static glenohumeral positions and two dynamic glenohumeral 
      movements, of which a total of five static and four dynamic poses were selected 
      for analysis. For standard RSA, negligible differences were found in bead 
      (0.21±0.31mm) and bony landmark (2.31±1.90mm) locations when the CT dosage was 
      decreased by 98% (p-values>0.167). For markerless RSA kinematic results, 
      excellent agreement was found between the normal-dose and lowest-dose protocol, 
      with all Spearman rank correlation coefficients greater than 0.95. Average root 
      mean squared errors of 1.04±0.68mm and 2.42±0.81° were also found at this reduced 
      dosage for static positions. In summary, CT dosage can be markedly reduced when 
      performing shoulder RSA to minimize the risks of radiation exposure. Standard RSA 
      accuracy was negligibly affected by the 98% CT dose reduction and for markerless 
      RSA, the benefits of decreasing CT dosage to the subject outweigh the introduced 
      errors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of 
      arthroscopy-assisted reconstruction of the coracoclavicular (CC) ligament using 
      Endobutton for treating acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation. METHODS: From 
      March 2012 to May 2013, a total of 22 patients with fresh AC joint dislocation 
      (Rockwood type III and type V) were treated with arthroscopy-assisted Endobutton 
      reconstruction of the CC ligament. The regular post-operation follow-up was 
      performed. Shoulder joint function was assessed with Constant-Murley scores. 
      Postoperative efficacy of the surgery was evaluated using the Karlsson criterion. 
      RESULTS: The 22 patients were followed postoperatively for an average of 24 
      months (16-31 months). Among them, 20 patients achieved good functional recovery 
      with no pain. Two patients had slight pain in the acromion during shoulder joint 
      motion with limited abduction at 3 months, both of whom had recovered at 6 
      months. Radiography confirmed anatomical reduction of the AC joint in all 
      patients. At 1 year, the Constant-Murley scores were 93.1 ± 2.4 points on the 
      injured side versus 94.2 ± 2.7 points on the uninjured side. The difference did 
      not reach statistical significance (P > 0.05). Postoperative Karlsson evaluation 
      ranked 20 patients (90.9 %) as grade A and 2 as grade B (9.1 %) at the 3-month 
      follow-up. All patients had become grade A at 6 months. None of the patients had 
      brachial plexus or peripheral vascular injuries. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopy-assisted 
      reconstruction of the coracoclavicular ligament by Endobutton fixation is a safe, 
      easy method for treating AC joint dislocation. It provides reliable fixation, 
      causes little trauma, and has a fast recovery.

      of 100 patients (104 shoulders) were diagnosed with adhesive capsulitis. A 
      retrospective chart review was performed of all of these patients. A total of 67 
      patients (69 shoulders) met the inclusion criteria of primary adhesive 
      capsulitis. The patients' range of motion and signs of impingement were 
      documented. The supraspinatus outlet radiographs were assessed, and each 
      patient's acromial morphology was graded as type I, II, or III. A case control 
      group of 53 patients (58 shoulders) was assessed to determine the validity of our 
      results. This group consisted of a series of new patients that were referred to 
      the clinic during February 2003 for assessment of their shoulders. RESULTS: The 
      average age of the patients in the adhesive capsulitis group was 52.5 +/- 7.6 
      years, with 34 women (50.7%) and 33 men (49.3%). The control group had an average 
      age of 51.1 +/- 16.9 years in a series of 19 (35.8%) women and 34 (64.2%) men. 
      The average range of motion was 98.0 degrees +/- 23.5 degrees of forward 
      elevation, and 91.9 degrees +/- 24.3 degrees of abduction. The forward elevation 
      was 165.5 degrees +/- 15.3 degrees and the abduction was 162.4 degrees +/- 18.4 
      degrees. The predominant acromial morphology in both groups in this study was a 
      type II acromion (75.4% in the adhesive capsulitis group and 74.1% in the control 
      group). The chi-square analysis within the specific groups showed statistically 
      significant differences in the number of type II compared with type I acromions, 
      and type II compared with type III acromions in both series. However, statistical 
      analysis showed no significant difference between the various acromial types when 
      comparing the adhesive capsulitis group with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results show a significant number of patients with both adhesive capsulitis and, 
      in the control group, type II acromions. We found no statistical difference 
      between these 2 groups. Based on our results, the intrinsic trauma that occurs 
      from subacromial space narrowing caused by the anterior acromial shape, cannot be 
      implicated as the cause of primary adhesive capsulitis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 
      III, case control study.

TI  - An improved quantitative ultrasonographic technique could assess anterior 
      translation of the glenohumeral joint accurately and reliably.

AB  - PURPOSE: Since poor repeatability of the load and shift test using a grading 
      scale has been reported, an objective and quantitative method to assess anterior 
      translation should be established to assess glenohumeral joint function. The 
      purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy and repeatability of the 
      ultrasonographic techniques to quantify anterior translation of the glenohumeral 
      joint. METHODS: Eight fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were used. For the 
      standard technique, the ultrasound transducer was positioned on the anterolateral 
      aspect of the shoulder viewing the coracoid process, glenoid, and humeral head. 
      For the revised technique, the transducer was positioned on the anterior aspect 
      of the shoulder, perpendicular to the scapular plane, viewing the conjoint 
      tendon, glenoid, and humeral head. During the load and shift test, the distance 
      between anterior edges of the glenoid and the humeral head was measured. The 
      difference between distances before and after applying an anterior load was 
      calculated as an anterior translation and compared with the anterior translation 
      assessed using a motion tracking system. The repeatability and accuracy of both 
      techniques were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Intra- and inter-observer 
      repeatability was good-excellent for both ultrasonographic techniques (ICC, 
      0.889-0.998). The revised technique achieved a stronger correlation to the 
      anterior translations obtained using the motion tracking system (R = 0.810-0.913, 
      p < 0.001) than the standard technique (R = 0.619-0.806, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      Better accuracy and repeatability was found in the revised technique than the 
      standard technique. The revised technique will be useful to determine the 
      individual laxity and modify the treatment plan and return-to-sports protocol.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential differences in both scapular positioning 
      and scapular movement between the symptomatic and asymptomatic contralateral 
      shoulder, in patients with unilateral subacromial pain syndrome (SAPS), and when 
      compared with participants free of shoulder pain. SETTING: Three different 
      primary care centres. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 73 patients with SAPS in their 
      dominant arm was recruited, with a final sample size of 54 participants. PRIMARY 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The scapular upward rotation (SUR), the pectoralis minor and 
      the levator scapulae muscles length tests were carried out. RESULTS: When 
      symptomatic shoulders and controls were compared, an increased SUR at all 
      positions (45°, 90° and 135°) was obtained in symptomatic shoulders 
      (2/3,98/8,96°, respectively). These differences in SUR surpassed the minimal 
      detectable change (MDC95) (0,91/1,55/2,83° at 45/90/135° of shoulder elevation). 
      No differences were found in SUR between symptomatic and contralateral shoulders. 
      No differences were found in either pectoralis minor or levator scapulae muscle 
      length in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: SUR was greater in patients with chronic SAPS 
      compared with controls at different angles of shoulder elevation.

TI  - Shoulder girdle impairment in breast cancer survivors: the role of range of 
      motion as predictive factor for dose distribution and clinical outcome.
PG  - 319-330
LID - 10.1177/0300891619839287 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain and functional impairment of the ipsilateral shoulder girdle in 
      patients who underwent surgery and radiotherapy for breast cancer (BC) is a late 
      complication reported in the literature. We analyze a correlation with dosimetric 
      parameters and propose an algorithm for sparing strategies. METHODS: A total of 
      111 patients treated for BC were included in this observational analysis during 
      follow-up protocol visits. Exclusion criteria were the presence of moderate or 
      severe arthrosis history and/or rheumatologic diseases. All the patients had 
      complete physical and multidimensional examinations during joint (physiatrist and 
      radiotherapy oncology) follow-up visits. A scapula-humeral articulation (SHA) 
      standardized contouring was performed retrospectively on Eclipse® treatment 
      plans. A possible correlation between patients' characteristics, radiotherapy, 
      and dosimetry analysis and functional impairment was investigated at statistical 
      analysis. Results of analysis were summarized into a proposal of algorithm for 
      sparing SHA. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were selected during follow-up 
      visits. Mean age of patients was 60 years (range 41-85 years). A total of 103 
      patients (93%) underwent conservative surgery, with 110 patients (99%) undergoing 
      axilla surgery as well. Fifty-two patients (46.8%) presented a reduction of range 
      of motion (ROM) abduction on the treated side at the observational analysis. Mean 
      ROM abduction reduction was 13°06' (range 0°-100°). Disability of the Arm, 
      Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH) score results were excellent in 79 
      patients (71.2%), discrete in 15 patients (13.5%), good in 15 patients (13.5%), 
      and sufficient in 2 patients (1.8%). Median EQD(2) D(max) at SHA was 18 Gy (range 
      0.22-51.9 Gy) and median EQD(2) mean dose at SHA was 2 Gy (range 0.04-24.32 Gy). 
      Univariate analysis showed a linear correlation between DASH score and ROM of 
      abduction of treated side (ρ=-0.7), ROM of abduction and ROM of flexion in 
      ipsilateral arm (ρ=0.8), or ROM of abduction and ROM of flexion in contralateral 
      arm (ρ=0.8). A statistically significant difference in ROM abduction between the 
      2 arms was found at χ(2) test (P<0.05 at χ(2) confidence interval = 95%). Cox 
      linear regression analysis showed ROM abduction on treated arm as a predictive 
      factor of DASH score (P<0.0001). Age (P<0.05), DASH score (P=0.006), and ROM 
      abduction on treated arm (P=0.005) were found as independent predictive factors 
      of mean dose at multivariate analysis. A mean dose higher than 7 Gy and ROM 
      abduction reduction more than 30° were related to DASH score level reduction. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This hypothesis-generating study introduces an algorithm to be 
      validated for management of sparing SHA and improving quality of survivorship. 
      ROM evaluation after surgery, early physiotherapy, standard contouring, and 
      planning adaptation represent possible indications to preserve shoulder 
      impairment. Further prospective studies are needed to discriminate impairment of 
      surgery and radiotherapy in order to personalized therapeutic plan programs.

TI  - Biomechanical analysis of a novel clavicular hook plate for the treatment of 
      acromioclavicular joint dislocation: A finite element analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clavicular hook plates are frequently used in clinical orthopedics to 
      treat acromioclavicular joint dislocation. However, patients often exhibit 
      acromial osteolysis and peri-implant fracture after hook plate fixation. To solve 
      the above problems, we developed a novel double-hook clavicular plate and used 
      finite element analysis (FEA) to investigate its biomechanical properties. 
      METHODS: A finite element (FE) model was constructed and validated. Then, a 
      double-hook clavicular plate, a single-hook clavicular plate, and an anatomical 
      double-hook clavicular plate was implanted into the acromioclavicular joint and 
      fixed with screws in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Finally, a load was 
      applied, and some indicators were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: For both the 
      proximal clavicular rotation angle and the distal clavicular displacement, the 
      range of motion in groups 1 and 3 was more than 90% lower than that in group 2. 
      The maximum von Mises stress of the clavicle in groups 1 and 3 was more than 45% 
      lower than that in group 2. The maximum stress of the acromion in group 2 was 
      significantly higher than that in groups 1 and 3, and that in group 3 was less 
      than that in group 1, for both cortical and cancellous bone. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      double-hook clavicular plate could immediately reconstruct the stability of the 
      acromioclavicular joint, effectively reducing the stress of the bone around the 
      clavicle and screws. Additionally, the double-hook clavicular plate could reduce 
      the peak stress of the acromion and produce a more uniform stress distribution.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In our society the average age is increasing, as are the number of 
      proximal humeral head fractures. For fixation of these fractures, an increasing 
      number of implants are available. New fixation devices should be compared 
      biomechanically with established methods in a standardized fashion. METHODS: The 
      test bench that was designed was intended to simulate abduction motion of the 
      humerus actively induced by muscle forces. We used three pneumatic muscles to 
      apply forces to the tendons of the musculus supraspinatus and the bifid musculus 
      deltoideus. Thus, it was possible to create an active abduction in the scapular 
      plane. Two different fracture models (with and without medial support) were 
      stabilised with an angular stable plate in sawbone models to reproduce a known 
      clinical outcome with the newly designed test setup. RESULTS: The resultant force 
      acting on the proximal humerus reached approximately 47% BW (per cent body 
      weight), which amounted to 329.0 N (SD: 21.76). The supraspinatus reached maximum 
      forces of 254.7 N (SD: 20.1) and the deltoid muscle 258.9 N (SD: 16.5). Fracture 
      gap instrumentation with medial support resulted in a significantly reduced 
      per-cycle fracture gap motion. CONCLUSION: The performance evaluation showed that 
      the simulator produced predicable, reproducible movements with physiological 
      muscle force magnitudes.

TI  - Three-dimensional recording and description of motions of the shoulder mechanism.
PG  - 27-40
AB  - A measurement technique is presented for recording positions of the bones of the 
      shoulder mechanism, i.e., thorax, clavicula, scapula and humerus, in 3-D space, 
      based on palpating and recording positions of bony landmarks. The palpation 
      technique implies that only static positions can be measured. Accuracy of 
      retrieving bony landmarks is checked on-line using rigid body assumptions. The 
      measurement error is calculated afterwards and is comparable with cinegraphic 
      methods. Axial rotation of the clavicula is estimated by minimizing rotations in 
      the acromioclavicular joint. A number of motion definitions is compared by means 
      of interindividual variation and subjective interpretability. Two useful 
      definitions are proposed for describing motions of the shoulder mechanism. Four 
      conditions have been recorded: abduction and anteflexion of the humerus both with 
      and without additional weight in the hand. Abduction and anteflexion result in 
      large differences in scapular and clavicular motions. The effect of additional 
      weight in the hand on the position of the shoulder girdle is negligible.

TI  - Reliability of dynamic and isometric testing of shoulder external and internal 
      rotators.
PG  - 543-52
AB  - Advances in isokinetic technology allow the physical therapist to assess 
      concentric, eccentric, and isometric muscle performance at the shoulder in 
      various positions. Research is limited, however, on the reliability of isokinetic 
      measurements. The purposes of this study were: 1) to determine the test-retest 
      reliability of concentric, eccentric, and isometric muscle performance 
      measurements of shoulder external and internal rotation in the scapular plane 
      test position and 2) to compare this reliability between the involved and 
      uninvolved limb of subjects with a history of unilateral shoulder pathology. 
      Fourteen males and 10 females (17-58 years) were tested on two occasions at 
      1-week intervals with the Biodex isokinetic dynamometer. Peak torque, total work, 
      and average power were recorded for concentric tests at angular velocities of 60 
      and 120 degrees/sec and for eccentric tests at 60 degrees/sec. Maximum average 
      isometric torque was recorded in two positions. Means, standard deviations, and 
      mean differences between sessions with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. 
      Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to determine test-retest 
      reliability. Isometric tests were generally most reliable (ICC = .81-.93), 
      followed by concentric (ICC = .60-.95) and eccentric tests (ICC = .44-.92). 
      Isokinetic and isometric reliability were usually higher for involved than 
      uninvolved shoulders. The implication of these findings is that there appears to 
      be greater variability with eccentric than concentric or isometric testing of 
      shoulder rotation. Factors that possibly contributed to variability are 
      discussed. Clinicians should recognize potential sources of testing error when 
      obtaining isokinetic measurements for use in clinical decision-making. Further 
      refinement of isokinetic testing protocols at the shoulder is recommended.

TI  - Insufficient consensus regarding circle size and bone loss width using the 
      ratio-"best fit circle"-method even with three-dimensional computed tomography.
PG  - 3222-3229
LID - 10.1007/s00167-019-05391-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Glenoid bone integrity is crucial for shoulder stability. The purpose of 
      this study was to investigate a non-invasive method for quantifying bone loss 
      regarding reliability and accuracy to detect glenoid bone deficiency in standard 
      two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) 
      measurements at different time points. It was hypothesized that the diameter of 
      the circle used would significantly differ between raters, rendering this method 
      inaccurate and not allowing for an exact estimation of glenoid defect size. 
      METHODS: Fifty-two shoulder CTs from 26 patients (26 2D-CTs; 26 3D-CTs) with 
      anterior glenoid bone defects were evaluated by 6 raters at time 0 (T0) and at 
      least 3 weeks after (T1) to assess the glenoid bone defect using the ratio method 
      ("best fit circle"). Inter- and intra-rater differences concerning circle 
      dimensions (circle diameter), measured width of bone loss and calculated 
      percentage of bone loss (length-width-ratio) were compared in 2D- versus 3D-CT 
      scans. The intraclass coefficient (ICC) was used to determine the inter- and 
      intra-rater agreement. RESULTS: The mean circle diameter difference in 2D-CT was 
      2.0 ± 1.9 mm versus 1.8 ± 1.5 mm in 3D-CT, respectively (p < 0.01). Mean width of 
      bone loss in 2D-CT was 1.9 ± 1.7 mm compared to 1.7 ± 1.5 mm in 3D-CT, 
      respectively (p < 0.01). The mean difference of bone loss percentage was 
      5.1 ± 4.8% in 2D-CT and 4.8 ± 4.5% in 3D-CT (p < 0.01). No significant 
      differences concerning circle diameter, bone loss width and bone loss percentage 
      were detected comparing T0 and T1. Circle diameter, bone loss width and bone loss 
      percentage measurements in 3D-CT were significantly smaller compared to 2D-CT at 
      T0 and T1 (p < 0.01). Agreement (ICC) was fair to good for all indicators of 
      circle diameter (range 0.76-0.83), bone loss width (range 0.76-0.86) and 
      percentage of bone loss (range 0.85-0.91). Overall, 3D-CT showed superior 
      agreement compared to 2D-CT. CONCLUSION: The ratio method varies in all glenoid 
      parameters and is not valid for consistently quantifying glenoid bone defects 
      even in 3D computed tomography. This must be taken into consideration when 
      determining proper surgical treatment. The degree of glenoid bone loss alone 
      should not be used to decide for or against a bony procedure. Rather, it is more 
      important to define a defect size as "critical" and to also take other 
      patient-specific factors into consideration so that the best treatment option can 
      be undertaken. Application of the "best fitting circle" is a source of error when 
      using the ratio method; therefore, care should be taken when measuring the circle 
      diameter. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

AB  - This study investigated the reliability and concurrent validity of active 
      shoulder elevation in the scapular plane (scaption) using a digital inclinometer 
      and goniometer. Two investigators used a goniometer and digital inclinometer to 
      measure scaption on 30 asymptomatic participants in a blinded repeated measures 
      design. Good reliability was present with intraclass correlation coefficients 
      (ICCs) for intrarater reliability of goniometry = 0.87, intrarater digital 
      inclinometry = 0.88, interrater goniometry = 0.92, and interrater digital 
      inclinometry = 0.89. The minimal detectable change (MDC95) for the interrater 
      analysis indicated that a change equal to or greater than 8 degrees for 
      goniometry and 9 degrees for inclinometry is required to be 95% certain that the 
      change is not due to intertrial variability or measurement error. The concurrent 
      validity between goniometry and digital inclinometry was excellent with an ICC 
      value of 0.94 for both raters. The 95% limits of agreement suggest that the 
      difference between these two measurement instruments can be expected to vary by 
      up to ±11 degrees. The results support the interchangeable use of goniometry and 
      digital inclinometer for measuring scaption. Clinicians and researchers should 
      consider the MDC values presented when interpreting change during subsequent 
      measurement sessions.

TI  - Three-dimensional acromioclavicular joint motions during elevation of the arm.
PG  - 181-90
LID - 10.2519/jospt.2008.2386 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. OBJECTIVES: To determine the 
      3-dimensional motions occurring between the scapula relative to the clavicle at 
      the acromioclavicular joint during humeral elevation in the scapular plane. 
      BACKGROUND: Shoulder pathology is commonly treated through exercise programs 
      aimed at correcting scapular motion abnormalities. However, little is known 
      regarding how acromioclavicular joint motions contribute to normal and abnormal 
      scapulothoracic motion. METHODS AND MEASURES: Thirty subjects (16 males, 14 
      females) participated. Subjects with positive symptoms on clinical exam or past 
      history of shoulder pathology, trauma, or surgery were excluded. Electromagnetic 
      surface motion analysis was performed tracking the thorax, clavicle, scapula, and 
      humerus. Subjects performed 3 repetitions of scapular plane abduction. Passive 
      motion data were also collected for scapular plane abduction from cadaver 
      specimens. Data were analyzed using within-session reliability and descriptive 
      statistics as well as repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to 
      determine the effect of elevation angle from rest to 90 masculine humeral 
      elevation. Reliability was determined from repeated trials in the same session 
      without removing sensors or redigitizing landmarks. RESULTS: Angular values were 
      highly repeatable within session (ICC>0.94; SEM, < 2.3 degrees ). During active 
      scapular plane abduction from rest to 90 degrees , average acromioclavicular 
      joint angular values demonstrated increased internal rotation (approximately 4.3 
      degrees ), increased upward rotation (approximately 14.6 degrees ), and increased 
      posterior tilting (approximately 6.7 degrees ) (P<.05). Passive motions on 
      cadavers demonstrated similar kinematic patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Significant motion 
      occurs at the acromioclavicular joint during active humeral elevation, 
      contributing to scapular motion on the thorax. This information provides a 
      foundation for understanding normal acromioclavicular joint motion as a basis for 
      further investigation of pathology and rehabilitation approaches.

TI  - On the kinematic modelling and the parameter estimation of the human shoulder.
PG  - 943-50
AB  - This paper presents some results on the modelling and the corresponding parameter 
      estimation of the human shoulder. This system consists of the clavicle, the 
      scapula, the humerus and the various joints between these bodies and the trunk 
      through the sternum; it will be represented as a succession of a rotational joint 
      between the sternum and the clavicle and a constant distance joint, representing 
      the scapula between, the clavicle and the humerus head. The parameters of this 
      system are the components of the position vectors of the joint characteristic 
      points (the corresponding centres of the rotations). Experimental results are 
      presented as well as a validation of the proposed model.

TI  - Measuring shoulder internal rotation range of motion: a comparison of 3 
      techniques.
PG  - 1229-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the reliability of shoulder internal rotation (IR) range of 
      motion (ROM) measured using 3 different methods: standard technique, manual 
      scapular stabilization technique, and visual inspection technique. DESIGN: 
      Prospective study. SETTING: Clinic-based sports medicine center. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Convenience sample of 56 unimpaired high-school athlete volunteers. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Shoulder IR ROM was 
      measured by using a digital inclinometer with each of the 3 techniques. All 
      measurements were performed independently by 2 groups of examiners and repeated 
      to determine intra- and interrater reliabilities. RESULTS: IR ROM measurements 
      obtained with the scapula stabilized or by visual inspection were significantly 
      less than when measured with the standard technique (P=.001). Intrarater 
      reliability was good or excellent for all 3 methods (intraclass correlation 
      coefficients=.63-.71), was similar for the scapular stabilization and visual 
      inspection techniques, and was superior to that previously reported for similar 
      measurements. In general, interrater reliability was lower than intrarater 
      reliability for all measurements. CONCLUSION: Because the visual inspection and 
      scapular stabilized techniques control for accessory scapulothoracic motion, 
      these techniques may represent more valid measures of glenohumeral motion than 
      the standard technique. Both the visual inspection and scapular stabilized 
      techniques exhibited equally acceptable reliability for clinical use. However, 
      because the visual inspection technique may be applied by a single examiner, we 
      recommend its use to measure shoulder IR ROM in the clinical setting.

TI  - Structure and internal consistency of a shoulder model.
PG  - 767-77
AB  - A three-dimensional biomechanical model of the shoulder is developed for force 
      predictions in 46 shoulder structures. The model is directed towards the analysis 
      of static working situations where the load is low or moderate. Arbitrary static 
      arm postures in the natural shoulder range may be considered, as well as 
      different kinds of external loads including different force and moment 
      directions. The model can predict internal forces for the shoulder muscles, for 
      the glenohumeral, the acromioclavicular and the sternoclavicular joint as well as 
      for the coracohumeral ligament. A solution to the statistically indeterminate 
      force system is obtained by minimising an objective function. The default 
      function chosen for this is the sum of the squared muscle stresses, but other 
      objective functions may be used as well. The structure of the model is described 
      and its ingredients discussed. The internal consistency of the model, its 
      structural stability and the compatibility of the elements that go into it, is 
      investigated.

TI  - Analysis of Agreement Between Computed Tomography Measurements of Glenoid Bone 
      Defects in Anterior Shoulder Instability With and Without Comparison With the 
      Contralateral Shoulder.
PG  - 2918-26
LID - 10.1177/0363546515608167 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) is frequently used to diagnose glenoid bone 
      defects in anterior shoulder instability. The assessment of glenoid defects on 
      2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) CT scans has been reported with and 
      without a comparative study of the contralateral shoulder; however, no previous 
      studies have analyzed if these 4 methods agree. PURPOSE: To estimate agreement 
      between CT assessments of glenoid defects by examination of the affected shoulder 
      alone and by comparison with the contralateral side on both 2D and 3D CT scans. 
      STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A total of 
      200 prospectively enlisted patients affected by unilateral anterior shoulder 
      instability underwent CT of both shoulders. The area of the missing glenoid was 
      calculated on 4 sets of CT scans (2D and 3D CT images with and without comparison 
      with the contralateral shoulder) by using the circle method. Agreement between 
      the 4 measurements in quantifying the bone defect was estimated according to the 
      Bland-Altman method. Agreement between the 4 measurements in assessing the 
      presence and type of defect (fracture or erosion) was analyzed with κ statistics. 
      RESULTS: Analysis of agreement between CT measurements in quantifying glenoid 
      bone defects showed that the mean difference between the 4 measures was less than 
      1% of the area of the inferior glenoid in each pairwise comparison. Limits of 
      agreement were always below the established acceptable limit of 5%. The 
      assessment of the presence and type of bone defect showed strong to near-complete 
      agreement between the 4 measurement methods. CONCLUSION: CT assessments of 
      glenoid bone defects with and without comparison with the contralateral shoulder 
      showed very good agreement in identifying the size, presence, and type of defect 
      in patients with anterior shoulder instability on both 2D and 3D CT scans.

TI  - Reliability of measuring pectoralis minor muscle resting length in subjects with 
      and without signs of shoulder impingement.
PG  - 176-83
LID - 10.1590/bjpt-rbf.2014.0146 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pectoralis minor adaptive shortening may change scapula resting 
      position and scapular kinematics during arm elevation. A reliable and clinically 
      feasible method for measuring pectoralis minor length will be useful for clinical 
      decision making when evaluating and treating individuals with shoulder pain and 
      dysfunction. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate intrarater, interrater, and between-day 
      reliability of a pectoralis minor (PM) muscle length measurement in subjects with 
      and without signs of shoulder impingement. METHOD: A convenience sample of 100 
      individuals (50 asymptomatic and 50 symptomatic) participated in this study. 
      Intra- and interrater reliability of the measurement was estimated in 50 
      individuals (25 asymptomatic and 25 symptomatic), and between-day reliability of 
      the measurement repeated over an interval of 7 days was estimated in an 
      independent sample of 50 additional participants. Pectoralis minor length was 
      measured using a flexible tape measure with subjects standing. RESULTS: 
      Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC3,k) for intrarater and interrater 
      reliability ranged from 0.86-0.97 and 0.95 for between-day reliability in both 
      groups. Standard error of measurements (SEM) ranged from 0.30-0.42 cm, 0.70-0.84 
      cm, and 0.40-0.41 cm for intrarater, interrater, and between-day reliability, 
      respectively, across the sample. The minimal detectable change (MDC) for 
      between-day measurements ranged from 1.13-1.14 cm for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In asymptomatic individuals and in those with signs of shoulder impingement, a 
      single rater or pair of raters can measure pectoralis minor muscle length using a 
      tape measure with very good reliability. This measurement can also be reliably 
      used by the same rater over a seven day interval.

TI  - Bony defects in chronic anterior posttraumatic dislocation of the shoulder: Is 
      there a correlation between humeral and glenoidal lesions?
PG  - 581-6
LID - 10.1007/s00590-016-1815-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of combined humeral and glenoid defects varies between 
      79 and 84 % in case of chronic posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability. The 
      main goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between humeral and 
      glenoid defects based on quantitative radiological criteria. METHODS: A 
      retrospective study was performed between 2000 and 2011 including patients who 
      underwent primary surgical shoulder stabilization for chronic posttraumatic 
      anterior shoulder instability, with bone defects in both the glenoid and humerus 
      and a healthy contralateral shoulder. The following measurements were taken: D/R 
      ratio (Hill-Sachs lesion depth/humeral head radius) on an AP X-ray in internal 
      rotation and the D1/D2 ratio [diameter of the involved glenoid articular surfaces 
      (D1)/the healthy one (D2)] on a comparative Bernageau glenoid profile view. 
      Measurements were taken by two observers. Correlations were determined by the 
      Spearman correlation coefficients (r), Bland and Altman diagrams, and intra-class 
      correlation coefficients (ICC). A sample size calculation was done. RESULTS: 
      Thirty patients were included, 25 men/5 women, mean age 29.8 ± 11.2 years. The 
      mean D/R was 23 ± 12 % for observer 1 and 23 ± 10 % for observer 2. The mean 
      D1/D2 was 95 ± 4 % for observer 1 and 94 ± 6 % for observer 2. No significant 
      correlation was found between humeral and glenoid bone defects by observer 1 
      (r = 0.23, p = 0.22) or observer 2 (r = 0.05, p = 0.78). Agreement of the 
      observers for the D/R ratio was excellent (ICC = 0.89 ± 0.04, p < 0.00001) and 
      good for the D1/D2 ratio (ICC = 0.54 ± 0.14, p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Humeral and 
      glenoid bone defects were not correlated. Inter-observer reliability was 
      excellent for the D/R ratio and good for the D1/D2 ratio. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Nonconsecutive Patients, Diagnostic Study, Level III.

TI  - Shoulder pain in primary care: diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination tests 
      for non-traumatic acromioclavicular joint pain.
PG  - 156
LID - 10.1186/1471-2474-14-156 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite numerous methodological flaws in previous study designs and 
      the lack of validation in primary care populations, clinical tests for 
      identifying acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) pain are widely utilised without 
      concern for such issues. The aim of this study was to estimate the diagnostic 
      accuracy of traditional ACJ tests and to compare their accuracy with other 
      clinical examination features for identifying a predominant ACJ pain source in a 
      primary care cohort. METHODS: Consecutive patients with shoulder pain were 
      recruited prospectively from primary health care clinics. Following a 
      standardised clinical examination and diagnostic injection into the subacromial 
      bursa, all participants received a fluoroscopically guided diagnostic block of 1% 
      lidocaine hydrochloride (XylocaineTM) into the ACJ. Diagnostic accuracy 
      statistics including sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, positive and 
      negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) were calculated for traditional ACJ 
      tests (Active Compression/O'Brien's test, cross-body adduction, localised ACJ 
      tenderness and Hawkins-Kennedy test), and for individual and combinations of 
      clinical examination variables that were associated with a positive anaesthetic 
      response (PAR) (P≤0.05) defined as 80% or more reduction in post-injection pain 
      intensity during provocative clinical tests. RESULTS: Twenty two of 153 
      participants (14%) reported an 80% PAR. None of the traditional ACJ tests were 
      associated with an 80% PAR (P<0.05) and combinations of traditional tests were 
      not able to discriminate between a PAR and a negative anaesthetic response (AUC 
      0.507; 95% CI: 0.366, 0.647; P>0.05). Five clinical examination variables 
      (repetitive mechanism of pain onset, no referred pain below the elbow, thickened 
      or swollen ACJ, no symptom provocation during passive glenohumeral abduction and 
      external rotation) were associated with an 80% PAR (P<0.05) and demonstrated an 
      ability to accurately discriminate between an PAR and NAR (AUC 0.791; 95% CI 
      0.702, 0.880; P<0.001). Less than two positive clinical features resulted in 96% 
      sensitivity (95% CI 0.78, 0.99) and a LR- 0.09 (95% CI 0.02, 0.41) and four 
      positive clinical features resulted in 95% specificity (95% CI 0.90, 0.98) and a 
      LR+ of 4.98 (95% CI 1.69, 13.84). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of primary care 
      patients with predominantly subacute or chronic ACJ pain of non-traumatic onset, 
      traditional ACJ tests were of limited diagnostic value. Combinations of other 
      history and physical examination findings were able to more accurately identify 
      injection-confirmed ACJ pain in this cohort.

TI  - Reliability and Validity of an Acromion Marker Cluster for Recording Scapula 
      Posture at End Range Clavicle Protraction, Retraction, Elevation, and Depression.
PG  - 379-383
LID - 10.1123/jab.2017-0058 [doi]
AB  - Acromion marker cluster (AMC) methods have been shown to accurately track scapula 
      motion during humeral elevation below 90°, however, their accuracy has not been 
      assessed in shoulder girdle motion such as clavicle protraction, retraction, 
      elevation, and depression independent of humeral movement. The aim of this study 
      was to examine the reliability and validity of the AMC method to record scapula 
      orientation at end range clavicle protraction, retraction, elevation, and 
      depression. The right scapulae of 22 female and 20 male asymptomatic volunteers 
      were assessed with an AMC and scapula locator (SL) method during end range 
      clavicle protraction, retraction, elevation, and depression (without humeral 
      elevation) using an 8-camera 3D movement registration system. Measurements 
      recorded from the AMC and SL measures showed fair to excellent agreement (ICC 
      0.4-0.92). While the AMC method overestimated and underestimated scapular motion 
      in some planes compared to the SL, root mean square error between methods were 
      low for scapular internal/external rotation (2.3-3.7°), upward/downward rotation 
      (4.5-6.6°), and anterior/posterior tilt (3.2-5.1°), across all conditions. The 
      AMC method was shown to be a reliable and valid measurement of scapula 
      orientation at end range clavicle movements independent of humeral movement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the glenopolar angle (GPA) at different inclinations of the 
      scapula using 3D CT, to test the hypothesis that the result could change the 
      indication from conservative treatment to surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Analysis of 30 3D CT images of patients' scapulae, measuring the GPA. The GPA was 
      measured with scapulae at 0(°) and at 20(°) and 30(°) of internal and external 
      rotation. Angles were compared by age, sex and examiner for the different angles 
      of rotation of the scapulae. RESULTS: The GPA of scapulae in rotation tended to 
      be smaller than the GPA without rotation, and the larger the degree of rotation, 
      the more the angle was underestimated. Additionally, for the same degree of 
      rotation, internal rotation was associated with greater underestimation of the 
      GPA than external rotation. Two different examiners achieved an excellent level 
      of agreement between angle measurements. The GPA with the scapula at 0(°) was 
      significantly higher among elderly patients. The variation in GPA with the 
      scapula in rotation (20(°) and 30(°)) in relation to the GPA without rotation was 
      significantly greater for female patients. CONCLUSIONS: As the rotation of the 
      scapula was displaced from the scapula in the coronal position (GPA 0(°)), both 
      in internal rotation and in external rotation, the GPA reduced. Therefore, 
      rotational displacement may lead to an error in GPA measurement, resulting in 
      incorrect indication of treatment. It is recommended that whenever possible, GPA 
      measurements should be taken in neutral rotation, with the scapula in a neutral 
      position at 0(°).

TI  - The effect of wearing loupes on upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders among 
      dental hygienists.
PG  - 174-9
LID - 10.1111/idh.12048 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: It is well established that musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are a 
      significant occupational health issue for dentists and hygienists. Despite this, 
      there has been little advancement in the application of ergonomic principles in 
      the dental profession. While the use of loupes is often promoted as an ergonomic 
      solution, there is little published research to robustly support this claim. The 
      aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the use of loupes on 
      upper extremity MSD among dental hygienists. METHODS: The study was conducted 
      using an exploratory pretest and post-test design, comparing musculoskeletal 
      measures in practising dental hygienists wearing loupes with final-year dental 
      hygiene students who did not wear loupes. Pre- and post-test measures included 
      valid self-reported and objective outcome measures and were measured at baseline 
      and 6 months following the intervention. Statistical analysis was conducted as a 
      series of mixed anovas with time and treatment as the independent variables. 
      RESULTS: The analysis revealed a significant interaction between time and 
      treatment for the Disabilities of the Shoulder, Arm and Hand (DASH) scores (P < 
      0.04), indicating an improvement in symptoms for the treatment group but a 
      reversed trend for the controls. There was also a significant mean increase in 
      scapular position measures; however, this finding was evident in both groups, 
      indicating that these were not a result of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Overall, this study suggests that wearing loupes appears to have both positive 
      and negative effects on upper extremity MSD among dental hygienists. Ongoing 
      research is required to determine the long-term effects of loupes wear, over an 
      extended period of time.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To validate a system, using electromagnetic movement sensors, for the 
      simultaneous measurement of scapular and humeral positions. DESIGN: The study was 
      designed to analyse the repeatability and to quantify the inherent measurement 
      errors, using two observers to measure the movements of five normal subjects. 
      BACKGROUND: Following an earlier study of a system to measure three dimensional 
      scapula motion, the method has been developed to incorporate simultaneous 
      measurement of humeral and scapular position using a new design of scapula 
      locator and a two-channel measurement system. METHODS: The system was used to 
      measure the scapula movements accompanying abduction of the shoulder. The scapula 
      locator was applied at 10 degrees intervals of abduction. This was measured 
      initially using a fluid filled goniometer, but, in a second part of the study, 
      using an additional motion sensor. RESULTS: In the single channel study, the 95% 
      confidence intervals were less than 4 degrees and 10 mm. When simultaneous 
      measurement of arm position was performed the confidence intervals were little 
      changed. CONCLUSIONS: A new system for the measurement of scapulohumeral 
      relationships has been shown to have good inter-and intraobserver reliability. 
      This study opens the way for a full investigation of the scapula motion 
      accompanying three dimensional shoulder motion in both normal subjects and in 
      patients having shoulder pathology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of high-speed movement on scapula kinematics is not clear 
      from the literature. Understanding these effects is important for clinicians 
      examining, managing and understanding scapula kinematic pathologies: impingement, 
      glenohumeral instability, muscle patterning instability and athletic injuries. 
      The scapula tracking methodology and the lack of quantified control of the 
      movement's plane of elevation limits previous studies. The aim of the present 
      study is to use improved dynamic scapula kinematic measurement to assess 
      differences during planar movements across different speeds. Athletic and maximal 
      speeds, neglected in previous studies, are the focus. METHODS: Thirteen subjects 
      performed slow, fast and maximal scapula plane abduction and forward flexion. A 
      previously validated skin-fixed scapula tracker was used and optimally 
      calibrated. A stiff board controlled the plane of elevation. Scapula kinematics 
      were consistent with the literature. FINDINGS: Large and statistically 
      significant differences were found to exist between scapula kinematics at slow 
      speeds compared to fast and maximal speeds in lateral rotation and protraction. 
      Although some differences were observed in the plane of elevation between speeds, 
      these were not considered to effect the conclusions. INTERPRETATION: The speed of 
      movement should be considered an important factor affecting scapula kinematics. 
      Clinical studies analysing muscle recruitment strategies and causes of injury in 
      athletic tasks must account for changing kinematics rather than extrapolating 
      slow or static measures and effective clinical examination and management of 
      pathology must take these kinematic changes into account. Control of the plane of 
      movement is challenging and its effectiveness must be quantified in future 
      kinematic studies.

TI  - Automated in-vitro testing of orthopaedic implants: a case study in shoulder 
      joint replacement.
PG  - 1297-309
AB  - This investigation presents the design and preliminary validation of a single 
      station simulator with biaxial motion and loading designed to mimic the 
      kinematics of the glenohumeral joint during arm abduction in the scapular plane. 
      Although the design of the glenoid holder allows the glenoid component to 
      translate in all three axes, it is primarily loaded axially, which brings it into 
      contact with the oscillating humeral head, but is also loaded superiorly to 
      simulate common subluxation of the humeral head. Simulating arm abduction in the 
      scapular plane simplifies component alignment and removes the need for 
      anterior-posterior loading, thereby creating a stable joint without the need to 
      simulate capsular constraints. In this more physiologically accurate simulator 
      design, the load and motion profiles influence the contact kinematics, but the 
      wear path is ultimately determined by the conformity and constraint designed into 
      the bearing couple. The wear data are determined and correlated with clinically 
      retrieved glenoid components, as well as previously reported in-vitro studies, 
      thus verifying use of the simulator in testing alternative materials and designs. 
      The key design features, as well as the improvements proposed through this study, 
      can be incorporated into the design of test fixtures for any other orthopaedic 
      implant such as the hip, knee, spine, elbow, and finger.

AB  - Accurate measurement of joint kinematics is required to understand the 
      musculoskeletal effects of a therapeutic intervention such as upper extremity 
      (UE) ergometry. Traditional surface-based motion capture is effective for 
      quantifying humerothoracic motion, but scapular kinematics are challenging to 
      obtain. Methods for estimating scapular kinematics include the widely-reported 
      acromion marker cluster (AMC) which utilizes a static calibration between the 
      scapula and the AMC to estimate the orientation of the scapula during motion. 
      Previous literature demonstrates that including additional calibration positions 
      throughout the motion improves AMC accuracy for single plane motions; however 
      this approach has not been assessed for the non-planar shoulder complex motion 
      occurring during UE ergometry. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
      accuracy of single, dual, and multiple AMC calibration methods during UE 
      ergometry. The orientations of the UE segments of 13 healthy subjects were 
      recorded with motion capture. Scapular landmarks were palpated at eight 
      evenly-spaced static positions around the 360° cycle. The single AMC method 
      utilized one static calibration position to estimate scapular kinematics for the 
      entire cycle, while the dual and multiple AMC methods used two and four static 
      calibration positions, respectively. Scapulothoracic angles estimated by the 
      three AMC methods were compared with scapulothoracic angles determined by 
      palpation. The multiple AMC method produced the smallest RMS errors and was not 
      significantly different from palpation about any axis. We recommend the multiple 
      AMC method as a practical and accurate way to estimate scapular kinematics during 
      UE ergometry.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the potential of employing a classification 
      tool to objectively classify participants with clinically assessed movement 
      faults (MFs) of the scapula. Six participants with a history of shoulder pain 
      with MFs of the scapula and 12 healthy participants with no movement faults 
      (NMFs) performed a flexion movement control test of the scapula, while scapular 
      kinematic data were collected. Principal component scores and discrete kinematic 
      variables were used as input into a classifier. Five out of the six participants 
      with a history of pain were successfully classified as having scapular MFs with 
      an accuracy of 72%. Variables related to the upward rotation of the scapula had 
      the most influence on the classification. The results of the study demonstrate 
      the potential of adopting a multivariate approach in objective classification of 
      participants with altered scapular kinematics in pathological groups.

AB  - To describe shoulder motion the sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular and 
      glenohumeral joint centres must be accurately located. Within the literature 
      various methods to estimate joint centres of rotation location are proposed, with 
      no agreement of the method best suited to the shoulder. The objective of this 
      study was to determine the most reliable non-invasive method for locating joint 
      centre locations of the shoulder complex. Functional methods using pin mounted 
      markers were compared to anatomical methods, functional methods using skin 
      mounted markers, imaging-based methods using CT-scan data, and regression 
      equations. Three participants took part in the study, that involved insertion of 
      intracortical pins into the clavicle, scapula and humerus, a CT-scan of the 
      shoulder, and finally data collection using a motion analysis system. The various 
      methods to estimate joint centre location did not all agree, however suggestions 
      about the most reliable non-invasive methods could be made. For the 
      sternoclavicular joint, the authors suggest the anatomical method using the most 
      ventral landmark on the sternoclavicular joint, as recommended by the 
      International Society of Biomechanics. For the acromioclavicular joint, the 
      authors suggest the anatomical method using the landmark defined as the most 
      dorsal point on the acromioclavicular joint, as proposed by van der Helm. For the 
      glenohumeral joint, the simple regression equation of Rab is recommended.

TI  - Glenohumeral and scapulothoracic strength impairments exists in patients with

      disability index.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain and loss of function are cardinal symptoms associated with 
      Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS), while the presence and magnitude of 
      deficits in strength and range of motion (ROM) are largely undescribed in 
      non-athletic patients with SIS. Moreover, the relevance of impairments in 
      strength and ROM to patient-reported shoulder function is not well described, 
      even though testing of strength is recommended in clinical guidelines. The 
      purpose of this study was, first, to investigate impairments in glenohumeral and 
      scapulothoracic strength and in abduction and internal rotation ROM in patients 
      with SIS. Secondly, to investigate the influence of these impairments on 
      patient-reported shoulder function. METHODS: Cross-sectional study based on a 
      consecutive cohort of 157 patients referred to specialist examination and 
      diagnosed with shoulder impingement (SIS) using predefined validated diagnostic 
      criteria. Prior to specialist examination, questionnaires regarding shoulder 
      function (Shoulder Pain And Disability Index, SPADI) demographics and 
      kinesiophobia (TSK-11) were collected, and shoulder strength and ROM was measured 
      by trained testers, with the patient reporting pain levels during testing and for 
      the last week. Impairments in strength (abduction, external-rotation, 
      (protraction and horizontal-extension) and ROM (abduction and internal rotation) 
      were investigated in patients with unilateral shoulder pain, using one-sample 
      t-tests. SPADI total score (SPADI) and SPADI function score (SPADI-F), were 
      chosen as dependent variables in multiple regressions to investigate the 
      influence of impairments on patient-reported shoulder function. Independent 
      variables of interest were; strength in abduction and external rotation, 
      abduction ROM, pain-during-tests, pain-last-week and kinesiophobia. RESULTS: 
      Significant impairments were found for all impairment tests, but most pronounced 
      for glenohumeral strength and abduction ROM (29-33% deficits), and less for 
      scapulothoracic strength and internal rotation ROM (8-18% deficits). Pain 
      variables influenced SPADI and SPADI-F score to a high degree (R(2) = 23.4-31.6%, 
      p < 0.001), while strength and ROM did not. CONCLUSION: Substantial strength and 
      ROM impairments were found in patients with SIS. Only pain significantly 
      influenced patient-reported function, while impairments did not. As SPADI score 
      does not reflect the substantial strength and ROM impairments in external 
      rotation and abduction observed in patients with SIS, supplemental assessment of 
      these impairments seems important.

TI  - Intra-articular kinematics of the upper limb joints: a six degrees of freedom 
      study of coupled motions.
PG  - 1657-71
AB  - In sport, leisure and certain occupational activities, joint lesions of the upper 
      limb are very common. To understand their aetiology in order to prevent and treat 
      these pathologies on a scientific basis, a comprehensive knowledge of the 
      involved stress and kinematics is imperative. For many years intra-articular 
      joint kinematics have been described hypothetically in terms of the 
      convex-concave principle. This principle, however, has not been validated. The in 
      vitro research on the acromioclavicular, glenohumeral and elbow joints was 
      performed using an electromagnetic tracking device (Flock of Birds). By 
      recalculating the positions of the trackers to an embedded coordinate system on 
      the joint surface, the intra-articular joint movements can be analysed. 
      Therefore, the bony configurations and articular surface features were registered 
      with a 3D drawing stylus (Microscribe). Thirteen acromioclavicular joints, six 
      glenohumeral joints and seven elbows were studied. The coupled intra-articular 
      movements were analysed using the Euler angles and finite helical axis 
      approaches. The results of the acromioclavicular joint analysis indicate that 
      during movements in the scapular plane a superior rotation of the clavicle was 
      coupled with an inferior translation and vice versa, whilst during movements in 
      the plane perpendicular to the scapular plane the anterior rotation was coupled 
      with an anterior translation and vice versa. In the glenohumeral joint, the 
      abduction-elevation was coupled with an external rotation. In the humero-ulnar 
      joint, the extension was coupled with an external rotation and varus movement. 
      This intra-articular behaviour was in contradiction to currently accepted 
      convex-concave concepts in arthrokinematics and manual therapy. The results may 
      have major implications for manual therapy and orthopaedic medical practice.

TI  - Within-Match PlayerLoad™ Patterns During a Simulated Soccer Match: Potential 
      Implications for Unit Positioning and Fatigue Management.
PG  - 135-40
LID - 10.1123/ijspp.2014-0582 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the acute alterations in triaxial accelerometry (PlayerLoad 
      [PL(VM)]) and its individual axial planes (anteroposterior PlayerLoad [PL(AP)], 
      mediolateral PlayerLoad [PL(ML)], and vertical PlayerLoad [PL(V)]) during a 
      standardized 90-min soccer match-play simulation (SAFT90). Secondary aims of the 
      study were to assess the test-retest reliability and anatomical location of the 
      devices. METHODS: Semiprofessional (n = 5) and university (n = 15) soccer players 
      completed 3 trials (1 familiarization, 2 experimental) of SAFT90. PlayerLoad and 
      its individual planes were measured continuously using micromechanical-electrical 
      systems (MEMS) positioned at the scapulae (SCAP) and near the center of mass 
      (COM). RESULTS: There were no between-halves differences in PL(VM); however, 
      within-half increases were recorded at the COM, but only during the 1st half at 
      the SCAP. Greater contributions to PL(VM) were provided by PL(V) and PL(ML) when 
      derived from the SCAP and COM, respectively. PL(VM) (COM 1451 ± 168, SCAP 1029 ± 
      113), PL(AP) (COM 503 ± 99, SCAP 345 ± 61), PL(ML) (COM 712 ± 124, SCAP 348 ± 
      61), and PL(V) (COM 797 ± 184, SCAP 688 ± 124) were significantly greater at the 
      COM than at the SCAP. Moderate and high test-retest reliability was observed for 
      PlayerLoad and its individual planes at both locations (ICC .80-.99). 
      CONCLUSIONS: PlayerLoad and its individual planes are reliable measures during 
      SAFT90 and detected within-match changes in movement strategy when the unit was 
      placed at the COM, which may have implications for fatigue management. Inferring 
      alterations in lower-limb movement strategies from MEMS units positioned at the 
      SCAP should be undertaken with caution.

TI  - Comparing the function of the upper and lower parts of the serratus anterior 
      muscle using surface electromyography.
PG  - 235-43
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective single-group repeated-measures design. OBJECTIVE: To 
      use electromyographic (EMG) analysis during muscle testing to determine if there 
      is a difference in function of the upper and lower parts of the serratus anterior 
      (SA) muscle. BACKGROUND: The SA muscle is a very important scapular protractor 
      and upward rotator. Authors have anatomically described the muscle as being 
      divided into 2 or 3 parts, and have suggested that the upper part is more suited 
      for protraction and the lower part for upward rotation of the scapula. METHODS 
      AND MEASURES: Surface electrodes recorded EMG activity of the upper and lower 
      parts of the SA muscle during 9 different muscle tests in 29 healthy subjects. 
      RESULTS: Three muscle tests demonstrated significantly greater (P<.05) EMG 
      activity in the lower part of the SA as compared to the upper part. There was no 
      significant difference in the EMG activity of the upper and lower parts of the SA 
      when the other 6 muscle tests were analyzed. CONCLUSION: When upward rotation was 
      the primary position of the scapula during the muscle tests, the lower part of 
      the SA was activated to a greater degree than the upper part. Muscle tests with 
      maximum scapular protraction with varying degrees of upward rotation produced EMG 
      activity with no significant difference when comparing the upper and lower parts 
      of the SA. This information may be helpful for clinicians when muscle testing and 
      developing exercise programs for the SA muscle.

TI  - Measurements of scapular position and rotation: a reliability study.
PG  - 148-58
AB  - Smooth motion of the scapula and humerus with respect to the thorax is essential 
      for shoulder function and abnormalities may indicate clinical entities. Recent 
      studies have made an attempt to devise simple, practical means of quantifying 
      scapular position. The aim of this study was to examine the intra-tester and 
      inter-tester reliability of two methods and to determine if significant 
      differences existed between the dominant versus non-dominant extremity. Seventeen 
      healthy volunteers (4 M; 13 F) were examined by two testers. The tape 
      measurements consisted of the classic methods of Kibler and DiVeta in three 
      sitting postures, expanded by the measurement of the linear distance from the 
      medial border to the thoracic mid-line, and the scapular size measure. The SAS 
      software package was used for data analysis. The Intraclass Correlation 
      Coefficient (ICC) intra-tester reliability ranged between 0.96-0.8 for both 
      methods without significant differences, whereas the ICC for inter-tester 
      reliability ranged between 0.42-0.9 with higher values (moderate and good) for 
      the Kibler technique. In the additional tests high values were also obtained for 
      ICC intra-tester, except for the measurements of the linear distance of the 
      medial border of the scapula to the thoracic mid-line and the distance of the 
      inferior process of the acromion to the third vertebra, both in 90 degrees 
      abduction and internal rotation. The ICC for inter-tester was only acceptable for 
      the DiVeta measurement on 45 degrees abduction. Significant differences were 
      noted between both testers on the following measures: Kibler in 45 degrees 
      abduction, DiVeta in 45 degrees abduction and 90 degrees abduction and the 
      scapular size measure. The comparison of dominant versus non-dominant extremity 
      revealed larger but not significantly different means for the dominant extremity 
      in the classic methods. Significant differences occurred for Tester 1 in the 
      measurement of the distance of the medial border to the thoracic mid-line and 
      Tester 2 in DiVita in 45 degrees abduction. The SEM values never exceeded 1 cm. 
      We believe that the Kibler technique holds promise for further studies, has the 
      advantage of measuring in three positions and with some familiarisation can be 
      reliable. Further research is necessary in patients with pathological conditions.

TI  - Analysis of the kinematic and dynamic behavior of the shoulder mechanism.
PG  - 527-50
AB  - A finite element musculoskeletal model of the shoulder mechanism consisting of 
      the thorax, clavicula, scapula and humerus has been used for analysis of the 
      kinematic and dynamic behavior. The model includes 16 muscles, three joints, 
      three extracapsular ligaments and the motion constraints of the scapulothoracic 
      gliding plane which turns the shoulder girdle into a closed-chain mechanism. 
      Simulations are inverse dynamic. Input variables are the positions of the 
      shoulder girdle and humerus which have been recorded in 10 subjects during 
      unloaded and loaded humeral abduction and anteflexion. Comparisons of muscle 
      force predictions and EMG recordings are hampered by the unknown force-length 
      relationship and the length dependency of EMG amplitude. It is concluded that EMG 
      amplitude cannot be used for validation of complex musculoskeletal models. Muscle 
      function is analyzed with help of a force and moment balance of the three joints. 
      The moment balance includes the contributions of ligaments and the reaction 
      forces at the scapulothoracic gliding plane. The scapulothoracic gliding plane is 
      very important for the motions and the stabilization of the shoulder girdle. The 
      direction and magnitude of joint reaction forces are calculated as well. It is 
      concluded that the model provides good insight into the mechanics of the shoulder 
      mechanism and that it enables an analysis of the function of morphological 
      structures.

      bursa: criteria].
PG  - 211-20
AB  - Shoulder soft tissues echographic evaluation depends on the availability of well 
      established echographic diagnostic criteria, which hasn't been fully accepted 
      until nowadays, as results in that field have been controversial. The main 
      purpose of the present study has been to determine the echographic criteria of 
      the most frequent shoulder periarticular soft tissue pathology. A prospective 
      study has been carried out, comparing the right to the left shoulder of 37 
      normals in order to determine the normal characteristics and limits of the 
      selected echographic parameters (echogenicity, echostructure, dimensions in terms 
      of width, rhythm of movement and rotator cuff competence ratio). Afterwards, the 
      relative role of these variables in the identification of three different 
      nosological groups determined through suitable gold standard diagnostic methods 
      (36 suprasinatus tears, 20 supraspinatus tendinitis and 22 subacromial bursitis) 
      has been determined. Lastly, the discriminant power of some echographic 
      parameters association was tested, thus suggesting the echographic criteria to be 
      selected. Results support the following criteria: 1) supraspinatus tears: cuff 
      competence ratio less than 1, the difference value between the affected and the 
      sound tendon thickness less than -1,8 mm associated with asymmetries of one of 
      the remaining parameters (echogenicity, echostructure or rhythm); 2) 
      supraspinatus tendinitis: the difference between the affected and the sound 
      tendon thickness bigger than 1 mm associated with asymmetries of one of the 
      remaining parameters (echogenicity, echostructure or rhythm); cuff competence 
      ratio equal or above 1;3) subacromial bursitis: the difference between the 
      affected and the sound bursa thickness bigger than 1 mm associated with 
      asymmetries of one of the following parametres: echogenicity, echostruture or 
      rhythm.

TI  - [Treatment of posterior instability of the shoulder joint using an acromial stop 
      with a pediculated deltoid flap].
PG  - 661-5
AB  - Our purpose has been to describe an original surgical technique without 
      describing all the problems concerning the posterior instability. The original 
      technique has a double effect: active with the muscular flap and passively 
      mechanic, if necessary, by the bone graft. Five patients have been treated with 
      this technique with a follow-up of one year and a half. 4 females and 1 male with 
      an average age of 32 years 1/2. 2 were recurrent posterior instability, one 
      unintentional and 2 intentional subluxations. 2 were epileptics. In all cases, 
      the disparition of the instability was obtained. Full range of movement and sport 
      were resumed at the former level. On X-rays, the humeral head was centered. By 
      its double mechanism, active with the muscular flap and possibly passive with the 
      bone graft, this technic is reliable to treat the majority of posterior 
      instability. It combines the way of action searched in physiotherapy and 
      capsulomyoplasties to center the humeral head and this one by the bone graft in 
      case of posterior glenoid fracture or dysplasia. It doesn't have the 
      insufficiencies of physiotherapy or capsulomyoplasties in posterior traumatic 
      instabilities, nor from the classical bone graft over the glenoid posterior wall, 
      cause of osteoarthritis and pain.

TI  - Ambulatory measurement of the scapulohumeral rhythm: intra- and inter-operator 
      agreement of a protocol based on inertial and magnetic sensors.
PG  - 636-40
LID - 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2011.12.015 [doi]
AB  - To measure the scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) in outpatient settings, the motion 
      analysis protocol named ISEO (INAIL Shoulder and Elbow Outpatient protocol) was 
      developed, based on inertial and magnetic sensors. To complete the 
      sensor-to-segment calibration, ISEO requires the involvement of an operator for 
      sensor placement and for positioning the patient's arm in a predefined posture. 
      Since this can affect the measure, this study aimed at quantifying ISEO intra- 
      and inter-operator agreement. Forty subjects were considered, together with two 
      operators, A and B. Three measurement sessions were completed for each subject: 
      two by A and one by B. In each session, the humerus and scapula rotations were 
      measured during sagittal and scapular plane elevation movements. ISEO intra- and 
      inter-operator agreement were assessed by computing, between sessions, the: (1) 
      similarity of the scapulohumeral patterns through the Coefficient of Multiple 
      Correlation (CMC(2)), both considering and excluding the difference of the 
      initial value of the scapula rotations between two sessions (inter-session 
      offset); (2) 95% Smallest Detectable Difference (SDD(95)) in scapula range of 
      motion. Results for CMC(2) showed that the intra- and inter-operator agreement is 
      acceptable (median≥0.85, lower-whisker ≥ 0.75) for most of the scapula rotations, 
      independently from the movement and the inter-session offset. The only exception 
      is the agreement for scapula protraction-retraction and for scapula medio-lateral 
      rotation during abduction (inter-operator), which is acceptable only if the 
      inter-session offset is removed. SDD(95) values ranged from 4.4° to 8.6° for the 
      inter-operator and between 4.9° and 8.5° for the intra-operator agreement. In 
      conclusion, ISEO presents a high intra- and inter-operator agreement, 
      particularly with the scapula inter-session offset removed.

TI  - Quantifying the extent of a type II SLAP lesion required to cause peel-back of 
      the glenoid labrum--a cadaveric study.
PG  - 1163.e1-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To quantify the extent of labral disruption required to cause it to peel 
      back when the peel-back test is performed. METHODS: Ten cadaveric shoulders were 
      prepared by removal of the deltoid and rotator cuff muscles. The glenohumeral 
      joint was concentrically reduced and brought into 90 degrees abduction and 
      maximal external rotation. The peel-back of the labrum was graded 0, 1, or 2. The 
      labrum was sequentially detached from the glenoid in the following order: biceps 
      anchor only, 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 11 o'clock, and 3 o'clock positions. After 
      each labral cut, the peel-back test was performed. Labral repair was performed 
      with a single suture anchor placed at the 12:30 o'clock position; labral 
      peel-back was reassessed. RESULTS: A progressive increase was noted in peel-back 
      grade with sequential cutting of the labrum posteriorly. However, disruption of 
      the anchor alone did not lead to a positive peel-back sign. Disruption to the 2 
      o'clock position resulted in a positive peel-back sign overall in 9 of 10 
      shoulders (5 were grade 1, and 4 were grade 2). No increase was seen in peel-back 
      grade with anterior extension of the labral detachment. Labral repair with a 
      single anchor placed at the 12:30 o'clock position eliminated labral peel-back in 
      100% of shoulders. CONCLUSIONS: Detachment of the biceps anchor alone does not 
      cause peel-back. The labrum must be disrupted to at least the 2 o'clock position 
      before overt (grade 2) peel-back is observed. A single suture anchor placed at 
      12:30 o'clock eliminated peel-back of the labrum. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Validation 
      of the peel-back test as an important diagnostic tool during shoulder 
      arthroscopy.

PG  - 205-7
AB  - The accuracy of measuring angulation of stable proximal humerus fractures using 
      the axillary lateral projection was investigated. A closing wedge osteotomy with 
      apex anterior angulation was performed on two cadaveric humeri to simulate a 
      stable surgical neck fracture. One specimen was fixed at 30 degrees angulation 
      and the other at 55 degrees. Axillary radiographs were taken with each specimen 
      articulating with the glenoid of a cadaveric scapula. The humerus was held in 
      neutral rotation. Abduction was set at 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees. In 
      each position of abduction, an axillary lateral radiograph was taken in 30 
      degrees forward flexion, neutral, and 30 degrees extension to simulate various 
      arm positions. A total of nine radiographs were taken for each specimen. The 
      axillary view is not accurate for measurement of proximal humerus angulation at 
      the arm positions commonly encountered in the trauma setting.

TI  - Patterns of motion loss in subjects with idiopathic loss of shoulder range of 
      motion.
PG  - 810-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subjects with idiopathic loss of shoulder motion have difficulty 
      sleeping, performing overhead activities, and completing activities of daily 
      living. Treatment has been variable in approach and success. Cyriax's proposed 
      shoulder capsular pattern was external rotation most limited followed by 
      abduction followed by internal rotation. This investigation was performed to 
      determine if a consistent pattern of motion loss was present in subjects with 
      idiopathic loss of shoulder motion. METHODS: Repeated measurement of 25 (22 
      female) subjects' bilateral shoulder patterns of motion were compared. The 
      three-dimensional position of the scapula and humerus throughout active shoulder 
      abduction, external rotation, flexion, internal rotation, and scapular plane 
      abduction was evaluated with an electromagnetic motion capture system. Patterns 
      of motion loss were determined for both shoulders. The proportions of peak 
      shoulder motion to mean maximum non-involved shoulders abduction, external, and 
      internal rotation were utilized to determine the pattern of motion loss. 
      FINDINGS: There was a significant difference in motion loss patterns between the 
      involved and non-involved shoulders with the arm at the side. The internal 
      rotation less than abduction less than external rotation pattern was demonstrated 
      in 14 of 25 (56%) involved shoulders. No pattern was present in 14 of 21 (67%) 
      non-involved shoulders. With the arm abducted, internal rotation was the most 
      limited motion in 23 of 25 (92%) involved shoulders. INTERPRETATION: The results 
      did not support Cyriax's proposed glenohumeral capsular pattern. Defining the 
      pattern of motion loss in subjects with idiopathic loss of shoulder motion may 
      assist in diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - PlayerLoad™: reliability, convergent validity, and influence of unit position 
      during treadmill running.
PG  - 945-52

AB  - PURPOSE: The study aimed to establish the test-retest reliability and convergent 
      validity of PlayerLoad™ (triaxial-accelerometer data) during a standardized bout 
      of treadmill running. METHODS: Forty-four team-sport players performed 2 
      standardized incremental treadmill running tests (7-16 km/h) 7 d apart. Players' 
      oxygen uptake (VO2; n = 20), heart rate (n = 44), and triaxialaccelerometer data 
      (PlayerLoad; n = 44) measured at both the scapulae and at the center of mass 
      (COM), were recorded. Accelerometer data from the individual component planes of 
      PlayerLoad (anteroposterior [PLAP], mediolateral [PLML], and vertical [PLV]) were 
      also examined. RESULTS: Moderate to high test-retest reliability was observed for 
      PlayerLoad and its individual planes (ICC .80-.97, CV 4.2-14.8%) at both unit 
      locations. PlayerLoad was significantly higher at COM vs scapulae (223.4 ± 42.6 
      vs 185.5 ± 26.3 arbitrary units; P = .001). The percentage contributions of 
      individual planes to PlayerLoad were higher for PLML at the COM (scapulae 20.4% ± 
      3.8%, COM 26.5% ± 4.9%; P = .001) but lower for PLV (scapulae 55.7% ± 5.3%, COM 
      49.5% ± 6.9%; P = .001). Between-subjects correlations between PlayerLoad and 
      VO2, and between PlayerLoad and heart rate were trivial to moderate (r = -.43 to 
      .33), whereas within-subject correlations were nearly perfect (r = .92-.98). 
      CONCLUSIONS: PlayerLoad had a moderate to high degree of test-retest reliability 
      and demonstrated convergent validity with measures of exercise intensity on an 
      individual basis. However, caution should be applied in making between-athletes 
      contrasts in loading and when using recordings from the scapulae to identify 
      lower-limb movement patterns.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Revision arthroplasty for failed post-traumatic humeral head 
      replacement associated with rotator cuff and glenoid deficiency is challenging. 
      Current surgical solutions are fraught with complications, and no best-practice 
      strategy has been established. We hypothesized that the computer-assisted 
      design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) shoulder (Stanmore Implants, 
      Elstree, UK), a total shoulder design resembling a total hip prosthesis, can 
      offer a reliable alternative in this surgically challenging subset of patients 
      with rotator cuff deficiency and advanced glenoid bone loss. METHODS: Twenty-one 
      patients with failed post-traumatic humeral head replacement associated with 
      rotator cuff and glenoid deficiency underwent revision with CAD/CAM shoulders 
      between 2005 and 2010. Clinical data were collected prospectively and analyzed at 
      a mean follow-up of 3 years. RESULTS: After revision, the pain rating at rest (on 
      a 0-10 numerical scale) decreased from 5.6 ± 1.3 to 1.1 ± 1.3 (P < .001) and pain 
      during activity decreased from 7.4 ± 1.2 to 2.1 ± 1.8 (P < .001). The Oxford 
      shoulder score improved from 47 ± 6 to 31 ± 9 (P < .001), and the subjective 
      shoulder value (on a 0%-100% scale) improved from 22% ± 14% to 45% ± 18% (P < 
      .001). Active shoulder range of motion was similar before and after revision. 
      Postoperative complications occurred in 9 patients and included 1 infection, 2 
      periprosthetic fractures, 2 prosthetic dislocations, and 4 fixation screw 
      fractures. No case of glenoid loosening occurred. CONCLUSION: The CAD/CAM 
      shoulder offers a reliable method of securing a glenoid component in shoulders 
      with advanced glenoid deficiency and should be considered as an alternative to 
      other surgical methods in these challenging cases. At 3 years' follow-up, pain 
      and clinical scores improved significantly and no case of glenoid loosening 
      occurred.

TI  - Isokinetic evaluation of shoulder rotational strength between the plane of 
      scapula and the frontal plane.
PG  - 124-8
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether shoulder rotational strength 
      was greater in the plane of the scapula or the frontal plane. Isokinetic shoulder 
      rotational strength was evaluated in 20 subjects. Using the Merac (Universal Gym 
      Equipment, Inc., Cedar Rapids, IA), test data was gathered in the right 
      shoulders, in 45 degrees abduction, at a speed of 60 deg/sec, in the plane of the 
      scapula and the frontal plane. Each subject returned within 1 week for retests to 
      establish reliability. The average correlational coefficient across tests was 
      0.87. The Merac computer system was used to analyze data. Mean and standard 
      deviations for peak torque to body weight were calculated. A paired t-test was 
      used to examine the difference in the means for internal and external rotation 
      between the two positions. The results indicated no significant difference 
      between the two positions for shoulder internal rotational strength values. 
      However, shoulder external rotational strength values in the plane of the scapula 
      were statistically significantly higher than in the frontal plane (P less than 
      0.001). These preliminary results suggest isokinetic strength training and 
      testing may be preferable in the plane of the scapula rather than the frontal 
      plane.

TI  - Scapulothoracic kinematics during tennis forehand drive.
PG  - 166-75
AB  - Scapular dyskinesis is recognized as an abnormality in the kinetic chain; yet, 
      there has been little research quantifying scapular motion during sport tasks. 
      Tennis forehand drives of eight highly skilled tennis players were studied to 
      assess the scapulothoracic kinematics and evaluate repeatability using 
      video-based motion analysis. Scapulothoracic downward/upward rotation, 
      posterior/anterior tilt, and internal/external rotation were computed using an 
      acromial marker cluster. On average, the upward rotation, anterior tilt, and 
      internal rotation varied from 1 degrees to 26 degrees, from 7 degrees to 32 
      degrees, and from 42 degrees to 100 degrees, respectively, during the tennis 
      forehand drive. During the backswing and forward swing phases of the forehand 
      stroke, small changes were observed for the three scapular angle values, while 
      all angles increased rapidly during the follow-through phase. This suggests that 
      the tennis forehand drive may contribute to scapula dyskinesis, mainly due to the 
      great amplitude in scapulothoracic anterior tilt and internal rotation observed 
      during the follow-through phase. Knowledge of normal scapula motion during sport 
      tasks performed at high velocity could improve the understanding of various 
      sport-specific adaptations and pathologies.

LID - 4277
AB  - The external workload measured in one anatomical location does not determine the 
      total load supported by the human body. Therefore, the purpose of the present 
      study was to characterize the multi-location external workload through 
      PlayerLoad(RT) of 13 semi-professional women's basketball players, as well as to 
      analyze differences among anatomical locations (inter-scapulae line, lumbar 
      region, 2× knee, 2× ankle) and laterality (left vs. right) during five tests that 
      represent the most common movements in basketball-(a) linear locomotion, 30-15 
      IFT; (b) acceleration and deceleration, 16.25-m RSA (c) curvilinear locomotion, 
      6.75-m arc (d) jump, Abalakov test (e) small-sided game, 10' 3 vs. 3 10 × 15-m. 
      Statistical analysis was composed of a repeated-measures t-test and eta partial 
      squared effect size. Regarding laterality, differences were found only in 
      curvilinear locomotion, with a higher workload in the outer leg (p < 0.01; 
      η(p)(2) = 0.33-0.63). In the vertical profile, differences among anatomical 
      locations were found in all tests (p < 0.01; η(p)(2) = 0.56-0.98). The nearer 
      location to ground contact showed higher values except between the scapulae and 
      lumbar region during jumps (p = 0.83; η(p)(2) = 0.00). In conclusion, the 
      multi-location assessment of external workload through a previously validated 
      test battery will make it possible to understand the individual effect of 
      external workload in each anatomical location that depends on the type of 
      locomotion. These results should be considered when designing specific strategies 
      for training and injury prevention.

AB  - A repeated-measures design was used to assess glenohumeral rhythm in 10 patients 
      with shoulder impingement and 10 pain-free persons and to assess the effects of 
      subacromial injection on glenohumeral rhythm within the impingement group. 
      Scapular-plane anterior-to-posterior x-rays of the scapula and humerus were 
      obtained at 5 angles of arm elevation (resting, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 
      degrees, 120 degrees). For the impingement group, x-rays were repeated after 
      subacromial injection (10 mL of 1% lidocaine). No significant differences in 
      glenohumeral rhythm were found between the impingement and control groups across 
      all arm-elevation angles.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability of using freehand 
      three-dimensional ultrasound to measure scapular rotations (internal/external, 
      upward/downward, anterior/posterior). The scapular position in 22 healthy, 
      nondisabled individuals was imaged three times in four testing positions of 
      interest (arm at rest and humeral elevation in the sagittal, frontal, and 
      scapular planes). We found substantial reliability across scanning positions and 
      scapular rotations, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.62 to 
      0.95. The highest reliability was found in the rest testing position. Our 
      standard error of measurement was less than 2 degrees for all measurements and 
      less than 0.5 degrees for most. Minimum detectable change ranged from 0.37 to 
      3.08 degrees. Our results agree with the pattern of movement found in other 
      studies, with the scapula moving toward a more externally rotated, upwardly 
      rotated, and posteriorly tilted position with humeral elevation. Further study is 
      warranted to compare our methods to a gold standard, apply them to evaluating 
      dynamic movement, and determine whether they can be used to detect shoulder 
      pathology.

TI  - Range of impingement-free abduction and adduction deficit after reverse shoulder 
      arthroplasty. Hierarchy of surgical and implant-design-related factors.
PG  - 2606-15
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.H.00012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluations of functional outcomes of reverse shoulder arthroplasty 
      have revealed variable improvements in the range of motion and high rates of 
      scapular notching. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the 
      impact of surgical factors (location of the glenosphere on the glenoid and tilt 
      angle of the glenosphere on the glenoid) and implant-related factors (implant 
      size, center-of-rotation offset, and humeral neck-shaft angle) on 
      impingement-free abduction motion. METHODS: A computer model was developed to 
      virtually simulate abduction/adduction motion and its dependence on five surgical 
      and implant-related factors. Three conditions were tested for each factor, 
      resulting in a total of 243 simulated combinations. The overall motion was 
      determined from 0 degrees of abduction until maximum abduction, which would be 
      limited by impingement of the humerosocket on the scapula. In those combinations 
      in which 0 degrees of abduction could not be achieved, the adduction deficit was 
      recorded. RESULTS: The largest average increase in the range of impingement-free 
      abduction motion resulted from a more lateral center-of-rotation offset: the 
      average increase was 31.9 degrees with a change in the center-of-rotation offset 
      from 0 to 10 mm, and this change resulted in an increase in abduction motion in 
      eighty of the eighty-one combinations. The position of the glenosphere on the 
      glenoid was associated with the second largest average increase in abduction 
      motion (28.1 degrees when the glenosphere position was changed from superior to 
      inferior, with the change resulting in an increase in seventy-one of the 
      eighty-one combinations). These factors were followed by glenosphere tilt, 
      humeral neck-shaft angle, and prosthetic size in terms of their effects on 
      abduction motion. The largest effect in terms of avoiding an adduction deficit 
      was provided by a humeral neck-shaft angle of 130 degrees (the deficit was 
      avoided in forty-nine of the eighty-one combinations in which this angle was 
      used), followed by an inferior glenosphere position on the glenoid (deficit 
      avoided in forty-one combinations), a 10-mm lateral offset of the center of 
      rotation, inferior tilt of the glenosphere, and a 42-mm-diameter prosthetic size. 
      CONCLUSIONS: An understanding of a hierarchy of prosthetic design and 
      implantation factors may be important to maximize impingement-free abduction 
      motion as well as to avoid inferior impingement.

TI  - [Displacement of the instantaneous center of rotation of the humeral head during 
      abduction: implication for scapulohumeral muscular function].
PG  - 399-406
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To date, studies of glenohumeral stress forces have been 
      based on the notion of a unique center of rotation situated at the geometric 
      center of the humeral head. Early work, e.g. Fisher et al in 1977, suggested that 
      the instantaneous center of rotation can migrate during abduction producing 
      muscle vectors with variable moments and consequently variable stress forces. We 
      conducted a kinematic analysis of the shoulder forces during continuous movement. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: An imaging device commonly used for angiography enabled 
      acquisition of one image per second during a continuous movement of abduction. 
      Images were obtained for twenty healthy shoulders in ten subjects. RESULTS: The 
      instantaneous center of rotation was not situated at the geometric center of the 
      humeral head. Although interindividual variability was significant, the 
      preferential positions of the instantaneous center of rotation implied a constant 
      reproducible succession of gliding, rolling, and translation in variable 
      proportions during the abduction movement. When the same movement was performed 
      with a 3500g load held in the hand, the ICR migrated towards the upper part of 
      the humeral head implying a predominance of the rolling motion over the gliding 
      and translation motions. Between 40 degrees and 60 degrees glenohumeral 
      abduction, the instantaneous center of rotation exhibited a metaphyseal 
      displacement producing a longer lever arm for the supaspinatus and an abduction 
      function for the infraspinatus and the subscapularis, unrecognized to date. After 
      60 degrees, medialization of the instantaneous center of rotation lengthened the 
      lever arm of the deltoid. DISCUSSION: A valid analysis of the glenohumeral stress 
      forces must take into consideration the localization of the instantaneous center 
      of rotation. In the clinical setting, our findings demonstrate that the 
      infraspinatus and the subscapularis play an important role which must be 
      considered both in surgery and in rehabilitation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the kinematics and associated muscular activity in 
      individuals with scapular dyskinesis may provide insight into the injury 
      mechanism and inform the planning of treatment strategies. We investigated 
      scapular kinematics and associated muscular activation during arm movements in 
      individuals with scapular dyskinesis. METHODS: A visual-based palpation method 
      was used to evaluate 82 participants with unilateral shoulder pain. Scapular 
      movements during arm raising/lowering movements were classified as abnormal 
      single pattern (inferior angle prominence, pattern I; medial border prominence, 
      pattern II; excessive/inadequate scapular elevation or upward rotation, pattern 
      III), abnormal mixed patterns, or normal pattern (pattern IV). Scapular 
      kinematics and associated muscular activation were assessed with an 
      electromagnetic motion-capturing system and surface electromyography. RESULTS: 
      More scapular internal rotation was found in pattern II subjects (4°, P = .009) 
      and mixed pattern I and II subjects (4°, P = .023) than in control subjects 
      during arm lowering. Scapular posterior tipping (3°, P = .028) was less in 
      pattern I subjects during arm lowering. Higher upper trapezius activity (14%, P = 
      .01) was found in pattern II subjects during arm lowering. In addition, lower 
      trapezius (5%, P = .025) and serratus anterior activity (10%, P = .004) were less 
      in mixed pattern I and II subjects during arm lowering. CONCLUSIONS: Specific 
      alterations of scapular muscular activation and kinematics were found in 
      different patterns of scapular dyskinesis. The findings also validated the use of 
      a comprehensive classification test to assess scapular dyskinesis, especially in 
      the lowering phase of arm elevation.

PG  - 359-70
LID - 10.3233/NRE-161327 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical scapulohumeral tests are lacking post-stroke. OBJECTIVE: To 
      test reliability and discriminant validity of clinical scapulohumeral assessments 
      post-stroke. METHODS: Following tests were assessed in 57 individuals with stroke 
      (IwS) (subdivided in a low, moderate, high proximal arm function (PAF) group) and 
      15 healthy controls: (1) Observation of tilting/winging; (2) shoulder girdle 
      position tests (pectoralis minor index, acromial index, scapular distance test); 
      (3) scapular lateral rotation measurement; (4) maximal humeral elevation and (5) 
      medial rotation test were executed. 15 IwS were measured twice by the same 
      assessor to determine test-retest reliability. Differences between controls and 
      IwS and between IwS with different levels of PAF were assessed. RESULTS: ICCs 
      were very high for all tests (>0.80), except the pectoralis minor index (0.66). 
      Weighted Kappas were high for observation and the medial rotation test (>0.70). 
      Group differences were found for observation, lateral rotation and humeral 
      elevation. IwS compared to controls, and IwS with lower compared to higher PAF 
      generally showed increased lateral rotation (p < .01); decreased maximal active 
      humeral elevation (p < .001); and more often tilting and winging (p < .05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of these tests in clinical settings will allow for 
      identification of altered scapular characteristics, which will enhance treatment

AB  - Micromotion around implants is commonly measured using displacement-sensor 
      techniques. Due to the limitations of these techniques, an alternative approach 
      (DVC-μCT) using digital volume correlation (DVC) and micro-CT (μCT) was developed 
      in this study. The validation consisted of evaluating DVC-μCT based micromotion 
      against known micromotions (40, 100 and 150 μm) in a simplified experiment. 
      Subsequently, a more clinically realistic experiment in which a glenoid component 
      was implanted into a porcine scapula was carried out and the DVC-μCT measurements 
      during a single load cycle (duration 20 min due to scanning time) was correlated 
      with the manual tracking of micromotion at 12 discrete points across the implant 
      interface. In this same experiment the full-field DVC-μCT micromotion was 
      compared to the full-field micromotion predicted by a parallel finite element 
      analysis (FEA). It was found that DVC-μCT micromotion matched the known 
      micromotion of the simplified experiment (average/peak error=1.4/1.7 μm, 
      regression line slope=0.999) and correlated with the micromotion at the 12 points 
      tracked manually during the realistic experiment (R(2)=0.96). The DVC-μCT 
      full-field micromotion matched the pattern of the full-field FEA predicted 
      micromotion. This study showed that the DVC-μCT technique provides sensible 
      estimates of micromotion. The main advantages of this technique are that it does 
      not damage important parts of the specimen to gain access to the bone-implant 
      interface, and it provides a full-field evaluation of micromotion as opposed to 
      the micromotion at just a few discrete points. In conclusion the DVC-μCT 
      technique provides a useful tool for investigations of micromotion around plastic 
      implants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aberrations in scapular motion are believed to be associated with the 
      presence of shoulder or elbow pathologies. There are many methods to evaluate 
      scapular kinematics, but they have certain limitations. Nevertheless, it is 
      believed that appropriate rehabilitation for each type of scapular dyskinesis is 
      important. METHODS: Eighty-nine athletes were videotaped and seven blinded 
      observers categorized scapular dyskinesis into 4 types, which was followed by 
      3-dimensional (3D) wing computer tomography (CT). Four blinded examiners 
      evaluated 5 angles [upward rotation (UR), internal rotation (IR), anterior 
      tilting (AT), superior translation (ST), and protraction (PRO)] on the 3D wing 
      CT. Inter-rater reliability (IRR) was calculated for both the methods. CT scan 
      measurements were compared with the 4 observational types to establish the 
      validity. RESULTS: The IRR with observational assessment of scapular dyskinesis 
      into 4 types was good, 0.780. The 3D wing CT analysis had a very high IRR, 0.972. 
      There was a statistically significant correlation between observational 
      assessment and 3D wing CT analysis. The UR angle, ST angle in type 3 scapular 
      dyskinesis, and AT angle in type 1 scapular dyskinesis were increased as compared 
      with those in the other types of scapular dyskinesis. All these measurements were 
      made in the resting position of the scapula. CONCLUSION: The 3D wing CT analysis 
      allows precise quantification of a position associated with scapular dyskinesis. 
      Therefore, 3D wing CT can be considered as an alternative method for assessing 
      scapular dyskinesis.

PG  - 2144-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2008.04.028 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to define a body-fixed coordinate frame for the scapula 
      that minimises axes variability and is closely related to the clinical frame of 
      reference. Medical images of 21 scapulae were used to quantify 14 different axes 
      from identifiable landmarks. The plane of the blade of the scapula was defined. 
      The orientations of the quantified axes were calculated. The angular 
      relationships between axes were quantified and applied to grade the sensitivity 
      of each axis to inter-scapular variations in the others. The volume of data 
      required to define an axis was noted for its dependency on pathology and the 
      three criteria were weighted according to relative importance. The two axes with 
      the highest weighting were applied to define a body-fixed Cartesian coordinate 
      frame for the scapula. A least square medio-lateral line through the centre of 
      the spine root was the most optimal axis. The plane formed by the spine root line 
      and a least square line through the centre of the lateral border ridge was the 
      most optimal scapular plane. This body-fixed Cartesian coordinate frame is 
      closely aligned to the cardinal planes in the anatomical position and thus is a 
      clinically applicable, specimen invariant coordinate frame that can be used in 
      patient-specific kinematics modelling.

TI  - The floating shoulder: clinical and functional results.
PG  - 1188-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Displaced ipsilateral fractures of the clavicle and the glenoid neck 
      are a complex injury pattern that is usually the result of high-energy trauma. 
      The treatment of these injuries is controversial, as good results have been 
      reported with both operative and nonoperative treatment. METHODS: Nineteen 
      patients who had sustained a displaced fracture of the glenoid neck with an 
      ipsilateral clavicular fracture or acromioclavicular separation (floating 
      shoulder) were retrospectively evaluated. The treatment was nonoperative in 
      twelve patients and operative in seven. At the time of final follow-up, standard 
      radiographs were made and all patients were examined by a physical therapist and 
      either a fellowship-trained shoulder surgeon or an orthopaedic traumatologist. In 
      addition, each patient responded to three different validated objective 
      functional outcome measures: the Short Form-36, the American Shoulder and Elbow 
      Surgeons Shoulder Scale, and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand 
      Questionnaire. Isokinetic strength-testing was performed, and strength in 
      internal and external rotation was compared with that of the uninvolved shoulder. 
      The main outcome measures included fracture-healing, functional outcome, patient 
      satisfaction, and muscular strength. RESULTS: With regard to range of motion, 
      only the amount of forward flexion was found to be significantly greater in the 
      operatively treated group (p = 0.03). The operatively treated shoulders were 
      found to be weaker in external rotation at 300 degrees /sec and weaker in 
      internal rotation at 180 degrees /sec. When normalized to hand dominance, 
      however, the numbers were too small to identify any significant difference. There 
      was no significant difference between groups with regard to the three functional 
      outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Good results may be seen both with and without 
      operative treatment. Therefore, we cannot universally recommend operative 
      treatment for a double disruption of the superior suspensory shoulder complex. 
      Treatment must be individualized for each patient.

TI  - Glenohumeral subluxation, scapula resting position, and scapula rotation after 
      stroke: a noninvasive evaluation.
PG  - 955-60
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether scapular downward tilt (ScDT) and dynamic 
      scapular lateral rotation (ScLR) in subjects with and without stroke is 
      associated with subluxation, and to prove the reliability of a Scapula Locator 
      System in an elderly population. DESIGN: Repeated measures of ScLR by 2 
      observers. SETTING: Outpatient rehabilitation department of a district general 
      hospital. PARTICIPANTS: To test device reliability, 5 healthy men (mean age +/- 
      standard deviation, 72 +/- 5 yr). To test scapula position, 30 stroke patients 
      (19 men, 11 women; mean age, 73 +/- 6 yr) and 15 healthy controls (12 men, 3 
      women; mean age, 62 +/- 6 yr). INTERVENTIONS: The control subjects' ScDT was 
      compared with stroke subjects' ScDT after stratification according to 3 patterns 
      of ScLR symmetry and the presence of palpable glenohumeral subluxation. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: For device reliability, 3-way analysis of variance. For scapula 
      position, triangulated location by Scapula Locator System of acromion, inferior 
      angle, and root of the scapular spine; then measurement of scapula motion to 
      determine symmetry, lag, or lead. RESULTS: The inter- and intraobserver 
      reliability of the Scapula Locator System device was high (1% of variance each). 
      Normal ScDT was positive (left side: 10.94 degrees +/- 2.62 degrees; right side: 
      9.69 degrees +/- 4.36 degrees ), indicating a downward-facing glenoid fossa. This 
      finding was unchanged by stroke (10.46 degrees +/- 2.42 degrees ). All controls 
      and 16 stroke subjects had symmetry between shoulders for ScLR rate and ScDT. Two 
      other patterns (p <.01) of ScLR were found after stroke: 8 subjects had a slower 
      rate of affected arm ScLR (lag) with a correspondingly greater ScDT on the 
      affected side (2.61 degrees +/- 6.7 degrees ); 6 subjects had a faster rate of 
      affected arm ScLR (lead) but with an upward-facing glenoid fossa on the affected 
      side (ScDT: -11.84 degrees +/- 8.48 degrees ). No significant inter- or 
      intrasubject difference in ScDT existed in the 6 cases of glenohumeral 
      subluxation. CONCLUSIONS: The scapula normally tilts downward with or without 
      stroke. The effect of stroke is similar on tonic (ScDT) and phasic (ScLR) control 
      of scapula position. Subluxation is not linked with a particular scapular resting 
      position after stroke.

TI  - The ability of massive osteochondral allografts from the medial tibial plateau to 
      reproduce normal joint contact pressures after glenoid resurfacing: the effect of 
      computed tomography matching.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current techniques for resurfacing of the glenoid in the treatment of 
      arthritis are unpredictable. Computed tomography (CT) studies have demonstrated 
      that the medial tibial plateau has close similarity to the glenoid. The purpose 
      of this study was to assess contact pressures of transplanted massive tibial 
      osteochondral allografts to resurface the glenoid without and with CT matching. 
      METHODS: Ten unmatched cadaveric tibiae were used to resurface 10 cadaveric 
      glenoids with osteochondral allografts. Five cadaveric tibiae and glenoids were 
      CT matched and studied. An internal control group of 4 matched pairs of glenoids, 
      with the contralateral glenoid transplanted to the opposite glenoid, was also 
      included as a best-case scenario to measure the effects of the surgical 
      technique. All glenoids were tested before and after grafting at different 
      abduction and rotation angles, with recording of peak contact pressures. RESULTS: 
      Peak contact pressures were not different from the intact state in the 
      autografted group but were increased in both allografted groups. CT-matched 
      tibial grafts had lower peak pressures than unmatched grafts. Peak pressures were 
      on average 24.8% (range [18.3%, 29.6%]) greater than in the native glenoids for 
      unmatched allografts, 21.8% ([17.0%, 25.5%]) greater for the matched allografts, 
      and 4.9% ([3.8%, 5.5%]) greater for matched autografts. CONCLUSION: Osteochondral 
      grafting from the medial tibial plateau to the glenoid is feasible but results in 
      increased peak contact pressures. The technique is reproducible as defined by the 
      autografted group. Contact pressures between native and allografted glenoids were 
      significantly different. The clinical significance remains unknown. Peak 
      pressures experienced by the glenoid seem highly sensitive to deviations from the 
      native glenoid shape.

TI  - Biceps load test II: A clinical test for SLAP lesions of the shoulder.
PG  - 160-4
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to describe the biceps load test II for 
      evaluating the superior labral anterior and posterior (SLAP) lesions. TYPE OF 
      STUDY: This is a double-blind study in consecutive data, which includes 
      diagnostic accuracy of a test using sensitivity, specificity, and interexaminer 
      reliability. METHODS: In the supine position, the arm is elevated to 120 degrees 
      and externally rotated to its maximal point, with the elbow in the 90 degrees 
      flexion and the forearm in the supinated position. The patient is asked to flex 
      the elbow while resisting the elbow flexion by the examiner. The test is 
      considered positive if the patient complains of pain during the resisted elbow 
      flexion. The test is negative if pain is not elicited or if the pre-existing pain 
      during the elevation and external rotation of the arm is unchanged or diminished 
      by the resisted elbow flexion. A prospective study was performed in 127 patients 
      to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy for the biceps load test II. Two independent 
      examiners were assigned to perform the new diagnostic test. The results of the 
      tests were confirmed during the arthroscopic examination. RESULTS: A positive 
      test result in 38 subjects correlated with a SLAP lesion in 35 patients and an 
      intact biceps-superior labrum in 3 patients. A negative test result in 89 
      patients correlated with an intact superior labrum complex in 85 patients, 
      whereas 4 patients with a negative test result had a type II SLAP lesion. The 
      biceps load test II had a sensitivity of 89.7%, a specificity of 96.9%, a 
      positive-predictive value of 92.1%, a negative-predictive value of 95.5%, and a 
      kappa coefficient of 0.815. The abduction and external rotation of the shoulder 
      during the test changes the relative direction of the biceps fiber in a position 
      of oblique angle to the posterosuperior labrum. The resisted contraction of the 
      biceps increases the pain generated on the superior labrum that is already peeled 
      off the glenoid margin in the abducted and externally rotated position. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The biceps load test II is an effective diagnostic test for SLAP 
      lesions.

TI  - Image-based RSA: Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis based on 2D-3D image 
      registration.
PG  - 155-64
AB  - Image-based Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (IBRSA) integrates 2D-3D 
      image registration and conventional RSA. Instead of radiopaque RSA bone markers, 
      IBRSA uses 3D CT data, from which digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) are 
      generated. Using 2D-3D image registration, the 3D pose of the CT is iteratively 
      adjusted such that the generated DRRs resemble the 2D RSA images as closely as 
      possible, according to an image matching metric. Effectively, by registering all 
      2D follow-up moments to the same 3D CT, the CT volume functions as common ground. 
      In two experiments, using RSA and using a micromanipulator as gold standard, 
      IBRSA has been validated on cadaveric and sawbone scapula radiographs, and good 
      matching results have been achieved. The accuracy was: |mu |< 0.083 mm for 
      translations and |mu| < 0.023 degrees for rotations. The precision sigma in x-, 
      y-, and z-direction was 0.090, 0.077, and 0.220 mm for translations and 0.155 
      degrees , 0.243 degrees , and 0.074 degrees for rotations. Our results show that 
      the accuracy and precision of in vitro IBRSA, performed under ideal laboratory 
      conditions, are lower than in vitro standard RSA but higher than in vivo standard 
      RSA. Because IBRSA does not require radiopaque markers, it adds functionality to 
      the RSA method by opening new directions and possibilities for research, such as 
      dynamic analyses using fluoroscopy on subjects without markers and computer 
      navigation applications.

TI  - Scapular kinematics and impairment features for classifying patients with 
      subacromial impingement syndrome.
PG  - 547-51
LID - 10.1016/j.math.2010.06.003 [doi]
AB  - Subacromial impingement syndrome (SAIS), which is associated with pain and a loss 
      of function, has a high occurrence in the physically active population. Not all 
      patients respond positively to treatment. Classifying patients can improve 
      decision-making. The scapular kinematic and clinical impairments can aid in 
      classifying the patients who are more likely to respond to physical therapy 
      treatment. Thirty-three subjects (males, 20-33 years) presenting SAIS were 
      studied to determine altered scapular kinematics and clinical impairments. Three 
      measurements were collected: (1) three-dimensional scapular kinematics during 
      performing functional tasks; (2) impairment outcomes of range of motion and 
      muscle force; and (3) self-reported measurements of pain, satisfaction, and 
      function. All patients received 6-week (2 times per week) physical therapy 
      treatment. Improvement with treatment was determined using the Global Rating of 
      Change Scale. Scapular kinematics and clinical impairments were first identified 
      by t-test in predicting improvement and then combined into a multivariate 
      prediction method. A prediction method with three variables (Flexilevel Scale of 
      Shoulder Function score < 41, muscle power of serratus anterior < 27.4% body 
      weight, degree of scapular internal rotation at 30° shoulder elevation during 
      descending arm phase in unloaded condition<0.7°) were identified. It appears that 
      scapular kinematics and impairment features can be used to classify subjects with 
      SAIS in addition to self-report. Prospective validation of the proposed 
      prediction method requires further investigation.

PG  - 1146-51
LID - 10.1016/j.apmr.2011.02.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the degree of impairment of shoulder proprioceptive acuity 
      in individuals with chronic rotator cuff pathology (CRCP), and to examine the 
      effect of impingement-related shoulder pain on acuity using a reliable laboratory 
      technique. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: University human movement 
      laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: A volunteer sample of individuals with CRCP (n=26) were 
      recruited and screened, and compared with age-, sex-, and limb dominance-matched 
      individuals (n=30) who acted as controls. Ten participants with CRCP underwent 
      repeat assessment after 2 days to determine the intrarater reliability of 
      proprioceptive measurement. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Each participant underwent assessment of joint position sense at 40° and 100° of 
      scapular plane abduction using an active position-matching task. Movements were 
      recorded with reflective skin markers and a multidimensional motion analysis 
      system. Self-reported pain intensity associated with the procedure was recorded 
      with a visual analog scale. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients (model 
      3,5) between repeat assessments ranged from .54 to .99. On average, those with 
      CRCP demonstrated reduced acuity at 40° and 100° test angles. In comparison with 
      the control group, proprioceptive acuity was significantly impaired (P<.01) at 
      the 100° test angle, where the pain intensity was significantly greater (P<.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated impairment of shoulder joint position sense 
      in CRCP. The degree of proprioceptive impairment was greatest at higher 
      elevations in the setting of increased shoulder impingement and pain, which may 
      serve to perpetuate the pathology. These findings provide a theoretic rationale 
      for the continued implementation of proprioceptive rehabilitation programs in 
      managing CRCP.

TI  - About the variability of the shape of the glenoid cavity.
PG  - 54-9
AB  - The morphology of the glenoid cavity is highly variable, and no consensus exists 
      regarding how to classify the different forms. We examined 98 dry scapulae to 
      identify a common morphological entity and to define reproducible bony references 
      of the glenoid cavity. The glenoid cavities were photographed perpendicularly in 
      a standardized fashion. The bony peripheral rim was studied on these 
      two-dimensional images, defined by randomly chosen points in order to define one 
      or more circles. This study showed that only the peripheral rim of the inferior 
      quadrants of the articular surface was found to be located on a circle ( P=0.926) 
      with a radius of 12.8 mm (SD 1.3 mm). Defining the center of this circle appeared 
      to be more reliable (ICC 0.98) than determining the middle point of the 
      longitudinal axis (0,0) between the most cranial and most caudal points, defined 
      as Saller's line (ICC 0.89). The distance of the center of this projected circle 
      to the middle point of Saller's line had a unimodal distribution, suggesting the 
      existence of only one glenoid cavity morphotype. We then investigated the 
      relationship between the center of the circle and the area of subchondral bone 
      thickening under the bare spot, the so-called tubercle of Assaki. Ten phenolized 
      cadaveric glenoid cavities were examined with computed tomography. A circle was 
      projected on the first image showing the bony peripheral rim, and this circle was 
      copied on the consecutive slices until the tubercle of Assaki came across. The 
      center of the circle was located within the area of the tubercle of Assaki, in 
      all but one specimen. To investigate the clinical implications of this finding, 
      the cadaver specimens were used to compare the position of the center of the 
      circle with the postulated center of implantation according to the literature, 
      and to the reference guide for a commonly used total shoulder prosthesis. The 
      center of the circle was consistently situated more distal than the postulated 
      center of the guide (mean 5.5 mm, range 4-8 mm) and the middle point of the 
      glenoid cavity (mean 2 mm, range 1-3 mm). These findings could offer a 
      reproducible point of reference for the glenoid cavity in osseous anthropometry 
      and a valuable reference in shoulder replacement surgery, and might help in the 
      definition of osseous glenohumeral instability.

TI  - Introduction of a new physical examination procedure for the differentiation of 
      acromioclavicular joint lesions and subacromial impingement.
PG  - 316-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present a new physical examination procedure that may assist in 
      differentiating acromioclavicular joint lesions from subacromial impingement 
      lesions. DISCUSSION: The acromioclavicularjoint differential test is performed by 
      applying downward pressure over the lateral one third of the clavicle while 
      passively inducing slight' adduction, external rotation, and forced forward 
      flexion to the humerus while the patient is in the seated position. Although 
      similar mechanisms have been described, the acromioclavicular joint differential 
      test is a new, previously unreported examination procedure. CONCLUSION: This 
      article describes a new test to differentiate between acromioclavicular joint 
      lesions and subacromial impingement. On the basis of its mechanism, the 
      acromioclavicular joint differential test may provide the examiner with an 
      additional tool in the differential diagnosis of acromioclavicularjoint lesions 
      and subacromial impingement in the patient with shoulder pain. Although this test 
      has been used by the author in a clinical setting, validation data are not yet 
      available.

TI  - Acromiohumeral distance in a seated position in persons with impingement 
      syndrome.
PG  - 72-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the acromiohumeral distance (AHD) of both shoulders in 
      subjects with a unilateral shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) and healthy 
      subjects in a seated position during free shoulder movements of large amplitude. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a 0.5-Tesla SIGNA-SP/i trade mark open-configuration 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system, the AHD was measured at several arm 
      positions, in a standardized seated position. RESULTS: In flexion (rest to 130 
      degrees ), the mean AHD of SIS varied from 8.3 to 2.8 mm, as compared to from 8.7 
      to 4.1 mm for asymptomatic contralateral shoulders. In abduction (rest to 110 
      degrees ), the AHD varied from 8.1 to 3.4 mm and from 8.8 to 4.6 mm for SIS and 
      asymptomatic shoulders, respectively. The smallest AHD (P <.01) was observed at 
      110 degrees. From 80 degrees of arm elevation, the AHD was significantly smaller 
      in impingement than in asymptomatic shoulders (P <.05). The AHD of asymptomatic 
      shoulders did not differ from that of healthy subjects. In SIS, the AHD at rest 
      was correlated with its reduction at all shoulder positions (r(p) = 0.62-0.88), 
      but was a poor predictor of the smallest AHD observed at 110 degrees (flexion, 
      R(2) = 0.09; abduction, R(2) = 0.08). CONCLUSION: In the critical arm elevation 
      positions for impingement, AHD is discriminative for SIS, compared to 
      asymptomatic shoulders and healthy ones. AHD at rest is a good indicator of the 
      magnitude of its reduction in elevation, but not of the smallest AHD in arm 
      elevation.

TI  - Can clinical observation differentiate individuals with and without scapular 
      dyskinesis?
PG  - 282-9
LID - S1413-35552014000300282 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Altered scapular rotation and position have been named scapular 
      dyskinesis. Visual dynamic assessment could be applied to classify this 
      alteration based on the clinical observation of the winging of the inferior 
      medial scapular border (Type I) or of the prominence of the entire medial border 
      (Type II), or by the excessive superior translation of the scapula (Type III). 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if there were differences in 
      scapular rotations (Type I and II) and position (Type III) between a group of 
      subjects with scapular dyskinesis, diagnosed by the clinical observation of an 
      expert physical therapist, using a group of healthy individuals (Type IV). 
      METHOD: Twenty-six asymptomatic subjects volunteered for this study. After a 
      fatigue protocol for the periscapular muscles, the dynamic scapular dyskinesis 
      tests were conducted to visually classify each scapula into one of the four 
      categories (Type IV dyskinesis-free). The kinematic variables studied were the 
      differences between the maximum rotational dysfunctions and the minimum value 
      that represented both normal function and a small dysfunctional movement. 
      RESULTS: Only scapular anterior tilt was significantly greater in the type I 
      dyskinesis group (clinical observation of the posterior projection of the 
      inferior angle of the scapula) when compared to the scapular dyskinesis-free 
      group (p=0.037 scapular and p=0.001 sagittal plane). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical 
      observation was considered appropriate only in the diagnoses of dyskinesis type 
      I. Considering the lower prevalence and sample sizes for types II and III, 
      further studies are necessary to validate the clinical observation as a tool to 
      diagnose scapular dyskinesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Latarjet coracoid process transfer procedure is an established, 
      reliable treatment for glenoid deficiency associated with recurrent anterior 
      shoulder instability, but changes in neurovascular anatomy resulting from the 
      procedure are a concern. The purpose of our cadaveric study was to identify 
      changes in the neurovascular anatomy after a Latarjet procedure. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We obtained 4 paired, fresh-frozen cadaveric forequarters (8 shoulders) 
      from the Maryland State Anatomy Board. In each shoulder, we preoperatively 
      measured the distances from the midanterior glenoid rim to the musculocutaneous 
      nerve, axillary nerve, and axillary artery in 2 directions (lateral to medial and 
      superior to inferior) and with the arm in 2 positions (0° abduction/neutral 
      rotation; 30° abduction/30° external rotation), for a total of 12 measurements. 
      We then created a standardized bony defect in the anterior-inferior glenoid, 
      reconstructed it with the Latarjet procedure, and repeated the same measurements. 
      Two examiners independently took each measurement twice. Inter-rater reliability 
      was adequate, allowing pre-Latarjet measurements to be combined, averaged, and 
      compared with combined and averaged post-Latarjet measurements by using paired 
      Student t tests (significance, P ≤ .05). RESULTS: We found (1) significant 
      differences in the location of the musculocutaneous nerve in the 
      superior-to-inferior direction for both arm positions, (2) notably lax and 
      consistently overlapping musculocutaneous and axillary nerves, and (3) an 
      unchanged axillary artery location. CONCLUSIONS: The Latarjet procedure resulted 
      in consistent and clinically significant alterations in the anatomic 
      relationships of the musculocutaneous and axillary nerves, which may make them 
      vulnerable to injury during revision surgery.

AB  - Markers put on the arm undergo large soft tissue artefact (STA). Using markers on 
      the forearm, multibody kinematics optimization (MKO) helps improve the accuracy 
      of the arm kinematics especially its longitudinal rotation. However deleterious 
      effect of STA may persist and affect other segment estimate. The objective was to 
      present an innovative multibody kinematics optimization algorithm with projection 
      of markers onto a requested axis of the local system of coordinates, to cancel 
      their deleterious effect on this degree-of-freedom. Four subjects equipped with 
      markers put on intracortical pins inserted into the humerus, on skin (scapula, 
      arm and forearm) and subsequently on rigid cuffs (arm and forearm) performed 
      analytic, daily-living, sports and range-of-motion tasks. Scapulohumeral 
      kinematics was estimated using 1) pin markers (reference), 2) single-body 
      optimization, 3) MKO, 4) MKO with projection of all arm markers and 5) MKO with 
      projection of a selection of arm markers. Approaches 2-4 were applied to markers 
      put on the skin and the cuff. The main findings were that multibody kinematics 
      optimization improved the accuracy of 40-50% and the projection algorithm added 
      an extra 20% when applied to cuff markers or a selection of skin markers (all but 
      the medial epicondyle). Therefore, the projection algorithm performed better than 
      multibody and single-body optimizations, especially when using markers put on a 
      cuff. Error of humerus orientation was reduced by half to finally be less than 
      5°. To conclude, this innovative algorithm is a promising approach for estimating 
      accurate upper-limb kinematics.

TI  - Reliability of the sitting hand press-up test for identifying and quantifying the 
      level of scapular medial border posterior displacement in overhead athletes.
PG  - 306-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: The lack of proper scapular kinematics can limit the function of the 
      entire shoulder complex.(1,3) Many forms of scapular dyskinesis have been 
      proposed along with tests to measure for the position and motion associated with 
      those positional and movement faults (2,4-6). While scapular internal rotation 
      has been listed among the forms of scapular dyskinesis there has not been a 
      reliable test documented in the literature that examines this motion. The purpose 
      of this study was to determine whether an innovative scapular medial border 
      posterior displacement measurement device has adequate inter-rater and 
      intra-rater reliability when used at rest and during the sitting hand press up 
      test. METHODS: 16 male Division III baseball players free of upper limb injury 
      for the previous 12 months participated in the study. Posterior scapular 
      displacement measures were taken on each subject in a resting static posture and 
      while performing a sitting hand press up test. Subjects were tested twice within 
      24 hours by two separate examiners. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) 
      were calculated to determine intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. RESULTS: 
      The intra-rater reliability for rater 1 was .97 (95% confidence interval [CI]= 
      .91-.98), for the rest position and .95 (95% CI= .86-.98) for the sitting hand 
      press-up position. Intra-rater reliability for rater 2 was .99 (95% CI= .97-.99) 
      for the rest position and .98 (95% CI=. 95-.99) for the sitting hand press-up 
      position. The ICCs for inter-rater reliability of the scapular medial border 
      posterior displacement measurement in at the rest position and the sitting hand 
      press-up position were .89 (95% CI= .81-.96) and .89 (95% CI= .80-.96) 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that the 
      measurement of medial border posterior displacement using this device 
      demonstrates good to excellent inter-rater and intra-rater reliability.

TI  - The Latarjet Procedure For Anterior Shoulder Instability : A Consecutive 
      Prospective Series Of 50 Cases.
PG  - 599-604
AB  - The Latarjet is a successful primary and revision option for anterior shoulder 
      instability. However, recent reports have highlighted varying complication rates. 
      Our study prospectively collected clinical, functional and radiological outcomes 
      of patients undergoing the procedure. Forty-eight consecutive patients (fifty 
      shoulders) underwent the Latarjet procedure in a single UK centre. Clinical, 
      radiological and functional follow-up was performed. Mean clinical follow-up was 
      32 months and radiological follow-up 20 months. 95% shoulders were subjectively 
      graded "excellent" or "good" and 5% "fair". Mean Rowe, Oxford Shoulder 
      Instability Score, American Shoulder and Elbow selfassessment Score and 
      Subjective Shoulder Value Score all improved post-operatively (p<0.001). No 
      infections, dislocations, revisions or metalworkrelated complications occurred. 
      There was one intra-operative coracoid fracture and five transient neurological 
      injuries, resolving within three months. The long-term complication rate was 2%. 
      The Latarjet procedure is safe and reliable for treating anterior shoulder 
      instability with a very low long-term complication rate providing excellent 
      clinical and functional outcomes.

TI  - Analysis of the scapulohumeral rhythm and electromyography of the shoulder 
      muscles during elevation and lowering: comparison of dominant and nondominant 
      shoulders.
PG  - 756-63
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2009.02.021 [doi]
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Assessment of whether elevation and lowering of the dominant and 
      nondominant arms occur in a similar manner in healthy individuals is clinically 
      important in terms of shoulder disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the 
      scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) and performed electromyography (EMG) for the middle 
      deltoid, upper trapezius, lower trapezius, and lower part of the serratus 
      anterior muscles of both shoulders in 18 healthy volunteers (14 men, 4 women) 
      with a mean age of 24 years (range, 19-30 years). The participants randomly 
      elevated and lowered either the right or left arm in the scapular plane, and the 
      motion was measured using a 3-dimensional motion analyzer. RESULTS: The average 
      angles of maximum arm elevation and scapular upward rotation were 130.3 degrees 
      +/- 7.9 degrees and 32.2 degrees +/- 5.6 degrees, respectively, for dominant 
      arms, and 130.8 degrees +/- 6.4 degrees and 31.8 degrees +/- 5.8 degrees, 
      respectively, for nondominant arms. The SHR in each 10 degrees increment did not 
      differ significantly between the dominant and nondominant arms in each 
      participant during elevation (P = .337) and lowering (P = .1). A significant 
      difference was found in the percentage integrated EMG (%IEMG) of the lower 
      trapezius between the 2 shoulders (P < .049). DISCUSSION: If the kinematic 
      difference is identified between both shoulders, we can predict the dysfunction 
      or disorder in shoulder complex. Moreover, we should evaluate how shoulder 
      muscles are used and whether the muscle becomes weak. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy 
      individuals elevate and lower the dominant and nondominant shoulders in a similar 
      kinematical pattern despite 3 of 4 muscles indicating different EMG activities 
      between both shoulders.

TI  - Static and dynamic strength of the shoulder rotators in healthy, 45- to 
      75-year-old men and women.
PG  - 11-8
AB  - Although clinicians routinely treat patients > 45 years of age and use ratio data 
      in making treatment decisions, the reliability of performance of these 
      individuals and the potential utility of ratio data are unclear. The purposes of 
      the present study were to examine the reliability of peak torques and 
      external/internal rotation (ER/IR) ratios for static, dynamic-concentric, and 
      dynamic-eccentric tests and to determine the interrelationships between strength 
      measurements in healthy 45- to 75-year-old subjects. Twenty men and 20 women 
      (mean age = 59 +/- 9 years) were tested on two occasions, completed within 4-6 
      days. With subjects sitting and their dominant glenohumeral joint positioned in 
      the scapular plane, two isolated contractions were completed at 0, 60, and 120 
      degrees/sec angular velocities. For peak torques (Nm), all 10 reliability 
      coefficients > or = 0.83, whereas for external rotation/internal rotation (ER/IR) 
      ratios (%), all five reliability coefficients < or = 0.67. Relative measurement 
      error (standard error of measurement/ standard deviation) was much larger for 
      ER/IR ratios (56-79%) than for peak torques (17-41%). Static and dynamic scores 
      were highly related for peak torques (r = 0.72-0.89), but poorly related for 
      ER/IR ratios (r = 0.23-0.36). The high variation associated with ratio data and 
      its tendency not to follow the pattern of relationships which characterizes 
      absolute data suggests that clinicians exercise caution when making 
      treatment-related decisions using ratio data.

TI  - 3-D scapular kinematics during arm elevation: effect of motion velocity.
PG  - 932-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: No three-dimensional (3-D) data exist on the influence of motion 
      velocity on scapular kinematics. The effect of arm elevation velocity has been 
      studied only in a two-dimensional setting. METHODS: Thirty healthy subjects 
      performed dominant (right) arm elevation in two planes, sagittal and frontal, and 
      at slow and fast self-selected arm speed. Scapular orientation and humeral 
      elevation were measured at 30 Hz recording frequency with use of a 
      6-degree-of-freedom electromagnetic system (Polhemus Fastraka). Motion was 
      computed according to the International Society of Biomechanics standards. 
      Scapular orientation was also determined with the arm held in different static 
      positions. FINDINGS: We obtained a full 3-D kinematic description of scapula 
      achieving a reliable, complex 3-D motion during humeral elevation and lowering. 
      The maximal sagittal arm elevation showed a characteristic "M"-shape pattern of 
      protraction/retraction curve. Scapular rotations did not differ significantly 
      between slow and fast movements. Moreover, protraction/retraction and tilt 
      angular values did not differ significantly between static and dynamic tasks. 
      However, scapular lateral rotation values differed between static and dynamic 
      measurements during sagittal and frontal arm elevation. Lateral scapular rotation 
      appears to be less in static than in dynamic measurement, particularly in the 
      sagittal plane. INTERPRETATION: Interpolation of statically recorded positions of 
      the bones cannot reflect the kinematics of the scapula.

TI  - Subject-specific shoulder muscle attachment region prediction using statistical 
      shape models: A validity study.
PG  - 1640-1643
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037154 [doi]
AB  - Subject-specific musculoskeletal models can predict accurate joint and muscle 
      biomechanics thereby helping clinicians and surgeons. Current modeling strategies 
      do not incorporate accurate subject-specific muscle parameters. This study 
      reports a statistical shape model (SSM) based method to predict subject-specific 
      muscle attachment regions on shoulder bones and illustrates the concurrent 
      validity of the predictions. Augmented SSMs of scapula and humerus bones were 
      built using bone meshes and five muscle attachment (origin/insertion) regions 
      which play important role in the shoulder motion and function. Muscle attachments 
      included Subscapularis, Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres Major and Teres Minor 
      on both the bones. The regions were represented by subset of vertices on the bone 
      meshes and were tracked using vertex identifiers. Subject-specific muscle 
      attachment regions were predicted using external set of bones not used in 
      building the SSMs. Validity of predictions was determined by visual inspection 
      and also by using four similarity measures between predicted and manually 
      segmented regions. Excellent concurrent validity was found indicating the higher 
      accuracy of predictions. This method can be effectively employed in modeling 
      pipelines or in automatic segmentation of medical images. Further validations are 
      warranted on all the muscles of the shoulder complex.

TI  - [Final results after operative treatment of shoulder joint infections].
PG  - 643-9
AB  - PURPOSE: In a consecutive case series the results of operative treatment of 
      patients with shoulder joint infections following rotator cuff surgery, 
      endoscopic subacromial decompression or subacromial injection were studied. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1990 and 2001 26 patients developed a postoperative 
      infection. 24 patients were available for a mean follow-up of 4.3 (1-12) years. 
      The mean age of the study group was 59.8 (28-84) years. Patients were divided 
      into three groups. Group I consisted of 9 patients with infection after rotator 
      cuff repair, group II consisted of 4 patients with infection after endoscopic 
      subacromial decompression and there were 11 patients in group III with an 
      infection that developed following subacromial injection. Patient evaluation was 
      done according to the Constant and ASES Scores, the SF-36 and a visual analogue 
      scale (VAS) for postoperative pain and satisfaction. RESULTS: The mean 
      postoperative Constant Score was 68.6 pts (SD 25.1) in group I, 84.6 pts (SD 
      10.4) in group II and 75.6 pts (SD 25.1) in group III. The mean ASES-Score was 
      65.6 pts (SD 30.0) in group I, 69.8 pts (23.6) in group II and 78.5 pts (SD 25.7) 
      in group III. The SF-36 showed for the summarized physical scale 37.3 pts (SD 
      12.6) in the first, 39.8 pts (SD 5.8) in the second and 37.7 pts (SD 12.4) in the 
      third group and for the summarized psychometric scale 40.4 pts (SD 2.7) in the 
      first, 44.3 pts. (SD 10.8) in the second and 45.7 pts. (SD 10.1) in the third 
      group. For the VAS for pain, group I had 4.3, group II 4.0 and group III 2.5 pts 
      Patient satisfaction showed similar results with 6.4 pts in the first, 6.5 pts in 
      the second and 6.8 pts in the third group. CONCLUSION: Considering the functional 
      results of operative revision, infection of the shoulder joint following rotator 
      cuff surgery, endoscopic subacromial decompression or subacromial injection is a 
      rare but severe complication.

TI  - A clinical method for identifying scapular dyskinesis, part 2: validity.
PG  - 165-73
LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-44.2.165 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Although clinical methods for detecting scapular dyskinesis have been 
      described, evidence supporting the validity of these methods is lacking. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the validity of the scapular dyskinesis test, a visually 
      based method of identifying abnormal scapular motion. A secondary purpose was to 
      explore the relationship between scapular dyskinesis and shoulder symptoms. 
      DESIGN: Validation study comparing 3-dimensional measures of scapular motion 
      among participants clinically judged as having either normal motion or scapular 
      dyskinesis. SETTING: University athletic training facilities. PATIENTS OR OTHER 
      PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 142 collegiate athletes (National Collegiate Athletic 
      Association Division I and Division III) participating in sports requiring 
      overhead use of the arm was rated, and 66 of these underwent 3-dimensional 
      testing. INTERVENTION(S): Volunteers were viewed by 2 raters while performing 
      weighted shoulder flexion and abduction. The right and left sides were rated 
      independently as normal, subtle dyskinesis, or obvious dyskinesis using the 
      scapular dyskinesis test. Symptoms were assessed using the Penn Shoulder Score. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Athletes judged as having either normal motion or 
      obvious dyskinesis underwent 3-dimensional electromagnetic kinematic testing 
      while performing the same movements. The kinematic data from both groups were 
      compared via multifactor analysis of variance with post hoc testing using the 
      least significant difference procedure. The relationship between symptoms and 
      scapular dyskinesis was evaluated by odds ratios. RESULTS: Differences were found 
      between the normal and obvious dyskinesis groups. Participants with obvious 
      dyskinesis showed less scapular upward rotation (P < .001), less clavicular 
      elevation (P < .001), and greater clavicular protraction (P = .044). The presence 
      of shoulder symptoms was not different between the normal and obvious dyskinesis 
      volunteers (odds ratio = 0.79, 95% confidence interval = 0.33, 1.89). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Shoulders visually judged as having dyskinesis showed distinct 
      alterations in 3-dimensional scapular motion. However, the presence of scapular 
      dyskinesis was not related to shoulder symptoms in athletes engaged in overhead 
      sports.

TI  - Does the acromiohumeral distance matter in chronic rotator cuff related shoulder 
      pain?
PG  - 38-42
LID - S2468-7812(17)30047-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.msksp.2017.02.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/HYPOTHESIS: The relation between acromiohumeral distance (AHD) and 
      severity of pain, disability and range of movement (ROM) in patients with chronic 
      rotator cuff related shoulder pain (RCRSP) has not been reported. OBJECTIVES: The 
      aim of this study was to investigate the level of association between AHD 
      measured by ultrasonography and pain-disability and shoulder range of movement 
      (ROM), in patients suffering from chronic RCRSP. As a secondary objective, the 
      determination of the intrarater reliability of AHD at both 0 and 60 degrees of 
      shoulder elevation was carried out. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. 
      METHOD: A sample comprised of 97 patients with chronic RCSRP symptoms was 
      recruited from three different primary care centres. Acromio-humeral distance 
      (AHD) measured by ultrasonography at 0 and 60 degrees of shoulder elevation, 
      shoulder pain-function (SPADI) and range of movement (ROM) were taken. RESULTS: 
      There was no correlation between AHD at 0° (-0,215), and at 60° (-0,148), with 
      SPADI. No correlations were found with AHD and shoulder ROM at both 0 and 60°. 
      Intrarater reliability was excellent for AHD at 0 and 60°. CONCLUSIONS: There was 
      a small association between AHD and shoulder pain and function, as well as with 
      shoulder ROM, in patients with chronic RCRSP. Hence, clinicians should consider 
      other possibilities rather than focusing their therapies only in increasing AHD 
      when patients with chronic RCRSP are treated.

TI  - External rotation in the glenohumeral joint during elevation of the arm.
PG  - 296-302
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe patterns of external rotation during humeral elevation, 
      and to compare motion patterns.Design. Patterns of external rotation during 
      forward flexion, scapular abduction and abduction in the frontal plane are 
      described with P-spline curves with an approximately 95% confidence interval. 
      BACKGROUND: External rotation of the humerus is an essential part of humeral 
      elevation. Standard clinical assessment of external rotation provides 
      insufficient information to describe external rotation patterns which may be 
      essential for insight in shoulder disorders.Methods. The dominant and 
      non-dominant arms of thirty subjects are measured, using a three-dimensional 
      electromagnetic movement recording system. RESULTS: Overall group patterns 
      demonstrate that humeral elevation in all planes is accompanied by about 55 
      degrees of external rotation, and each elevation plane has its own typical 
      pattern. The dominant and non-dominant sides are comparable and can be combined. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There are specific external rotation patterns for each elevation 
      plane. Curves representing the approximately 95% confidence intervals make 
      comparison between groups possible. This method can therefore possibly be used to 
      study the external rotation patterns in groups with certain shoulder disorders to 
      evaluate the results of before and after treatment. RELEVANCE: The method 
      presented in this paper can be used to study external rotation patterns in 
      healthy shoulders and in shoulders with a specific disorders to gain more 
      insight, to define functional treatment, and to evaluate the results of 
      treatment.

TI  - Reliability and validity assessment of a glenoid bone loss measurement using the 
      Bernageau profile view in chronic anterior shoulder instability.

LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2012.12.032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the identified risk factors for anterior shoulder instability 
      is bone loss on the anterior-inferior glenoid rim. The aim of our study was to 
      assess intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of the Bernageau view to 
      estimate glenoid bone loss and validate this radiographic method with computed 
      tomography (CT) scan. The second objective was to find correlation between 
      Bernageau and arthroscopic bone loss measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty 
      patients were included retrospectively. Two independent observers evaluated 
      glenoid bone loss with the ratio between glenoid joint surface diameters of the 
      pathologic and healthy shoulders on Bernageau views. Results were compared with 
      CT (gold standard) and arthroscopic measurements. Validity and reliability of 
      Bernageau measurement were assessed with Spearman correlation coefficients (r) 
      and intraclass correlation coefficients (ρ). RESULTS: The interobserver and 
      intraobserver reliability and the validity of Bernageau measurement compared with 
      the reference test, the CT scan, were all excellent, with a Spearman ρ between 
      0.56 (P = .0002) and 0.95 (P < .00001) and an intraclass correlation coefficient 
      between 0.82 (P = .0007) and 0.97 (P < .10(-5)). There was no correlation with 
      arthroscopic evaluation. CONCLUSION: The glenoid bone defect measurement on the 
      Bernageau profile view is a valid and reliable method. Furthermore, it is easy to 
      use in current clinical practice. Surgeons can therefore consider it as a tool 
      for preoperative planning, and its use could decrease CT scan indications.

TI  - Towards the development of a novel experimental shoulder simulator with rotating 
      scapula and individually controlled muscle forces simulating the rotator cuff.
PG  - 293-9
LID - 10.1007/s11517-013-1120-z [doi]
AB  - A preclinical analysis of novel implants used in shoulder surgery requires 
      biomechanical testing conditions close to physiology. Existing shoulder 
      experiments may only partially apply multiple cycles to simulate postoperative, 
      repetitive loading tasks. The aim of the present study was therefore the 
      development of an experimental shoulder simulator with rotating scapula able to 
      perform multiple humeral movement cycles by simulating individual muscles 
      attached to the rotator cuff. A free-hanging, metallic humerus pivoted in a 
      polyethylene glenoid is activated by tension forces of linear electroactuators to 
      simulate muscles of the deltoideus (DELT), supraspinatus (SSP), 
      infraspinatus/teres minor and subscapularis. The abductors DELT and SSP apply 
      forces with a ratio of 3:1 up to an abduction angle of 85°. The rotating scapular 
      part driven by a rotative electro actuator provides one-third to the overall arm 
      abduction. Resulting joint forces and moments are measured by a 6-axis load cell. 
      A linear increase in the DELT and SSP motors is shown up to a maximum of 150 and 
      50 N for the DELT and SSP, respectively. The force vector in the glenoid resulted 
      in 253 N at the maximum abduction. The present investigation shows the 
      contribution of individual muscle forces attached to the moving humerus to 
      perform active abduction in order to reproducibly test shoulder implants.

TI  - The resisted supination external rotation test: a new test for the diagnosis of 
      superior labral anterior posterior lesions.
PG  - 1315-20
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate a new clinical test, the resisted supination external 
      rotation test, for the diagnosis of superior labral anterior posterior lesions of 
      the shoulder. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. 
      METHODS: Forty athletes (average age, 23.9 years) with activity-related shoulder 
      pain were enrolled in the study. The patients underwent 3 different tests 
      designed specifically to detect superior labral anterior posterior lesions (the 
      resisted supination external rotation test, the crank test, and the active 
      compression test); the tests were performed in a random order on the affected 
      shoulder. The results of the tests were compared with arthroscopic findings. 
      RESULTS: Out of 40 athletes, 29 (72.5%) had superior labral anterior posterior 
      tears. The resisted supination external rotation test had the highest sensitivity 
      (82.8%), specificity (81.8%), positive predictive value (92.3%), negative 
      predictive value (64.3%), and diagnostic accuracy (82.5%) of all tests performed. 
      CONCLUSION: By re-creating the peel-back mechanism, the resisted supination 
      external rotation test is more accurate than 2 other commonly used physical 
      examination tests designed to diagnose superior labral anterior posterior tears 
      in overhead-throwing athletes. By using this test in the context of a thorough 
      clinical history and physical examination, lesions of the superior labrum can be 
      more reliably diagnosed.

TI  - A new method for motion capture of the scapula using an optoelectronic tracking 
      device: a feasibility study.

AB  - Optoelectronic tracking systems are rarely used in 3D studies examining shoulder 
      movements including the scapula. Among the reasons is the important slippage of 
      skin markers with respect to scapula. Methods using electromagnetic tracking 
      devices are validated and frequently applied. Thus, the aim of this study was to 
      develop a new method for in vivo optoelectronic scapular capture dealing with the 
      accepted accuracy issues of validated methods. Eleven arm positions in three 
      anatomical planes were examined using five subjects in static mode. The method 
      was based on local optimisation, and recalculation procedures were made using a 
      set of five scapular surface markers. The scapular rotations derived from the 
      recalculation-based method yielded RMS errors comparable with the frequently used 
      electromagnetic scapular methods (RMS up to 12.6° for 150° arm elevation). The 
      results indicate that the present method can be used under careful considerations 
      for 3D kinematical studies examining different shoulder movements.

TI  - Variability of measurement of glenoid version on computed tomography scan.
PG  - 595-8
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the variability of measurement that 
      might occur with rotation of the scapula in the coronal plane when computed 
      tomography scanning is used. Ten dry scapula specimens had 4 sets of computed 
      tomography scans performed at +20 degrees, +10 degrees, neutral, and -10 degrees 
      of scapula rotation. The angle of glenoid version was then measured according to 
      the technique of Friedman. The measured value for glenoid version was noted to 
      vary by as much as 10 degrees on the same specimen with minor rotation of the 
      scapula. This result occurred because of differences in the curvature of the 
      vertebral border of the scapula. The measured angle of glenoid version was most 
      likely to vary with rotation of the scapula 10 degrees downward (i.e., glenoid 
      articular surface facing 10 degrees upward). For accurate and reproducible 
      measurement of the glenoid version, it is essential that in the scout view the 
      glenoid orientation is neutral (i.e., glenoid surface is perpendicular to the 
      plane of the computed tomography cut).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional (3D) wing computed tomography (CT) showed a high 
      inter-rater reliability in assessing scapular dyskinesis. METHODS: The 330 
      scapular movements of 165 patients were classified into 4 types by 7 blinded 
      observers. Then, 3D wing CT was performed with patients prone, and 4 blinded 
      observers measured 5 angles, consisting of upward rotation (UR) superior 
      translation (ST), anterior tilting (AT), protraction (PRO), and internal rotation 
      (IR). The inter-rater reliability (IRR) of 2 methods was calculated, and cutoff 
      values were determined for the 5 angles on the 3D wing CT images. RESULTS: The 
      IRR was 0.783 for the observational method of scapular dyskinesis and 0.981 for 
      3D wing CT in the prone position. UR and ST angles were significantly larger in 
      type 3 more than in the other types (P < .001, P < .001), and the AT angle showed 
      a similar pattern in type 1 (P < .001). The PRO angle was significantly larger in 
      types 1, 2, and 3 more than in type 4 (P < .001, P < .001, P = .013), and the IR 
      angle was significantly larger in type 2 more than in the other types (P < .001). 
      The cutoff values of the 5 angles were UR, 117°; ST, 90°; AT, 8°; PRO, 99°; and 
      IR, 51°. The UR angle showed a significant correlation with glenohumeral internal 
      rotation deficit (odds ratio, 0.436; P = .029) and the IR angle with MDI (odds 
      ratio, 8.947; P = .048). CONCLUSION: The patients with a high UR angle showed a 
      low rate of glenohumeral internal rotation deficit and those with a high IR angle 
      had a high rate of the MDI in affected shoulder by the determinant of the cutoff 
      value of the 5 angles. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, development of diagnostic 
      criteria with nonconsecutive patients, diagnostic study.

TI  - Glenoid loosening and failure in anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty: is 
      revision with a reverse shoulder arthroplasty a reliable option?
PG  - 342-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2011.05.021 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our purpose was to evaluate if, in case of aseptic glenoid 
      loosening and failure in anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), revision 
      by a reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is a reliable therapeutic option. 
      METHODS: Retrospective multicenter cohort study of 37 consecutive anatomical TSA 
      revised by RSA for aseptic glenoid loosening or failure. The decision to implant 
      a RSA was related to the presence of associated complications: rotator cuff tears 
      (n = 24), subscapularis insufficiency (n = 29), prosthetic instability (n = 13), 
      and glenoid bone deficiency (n = 37). The patients were reviewed clinically and 
      radiographically at a mean follow-up of 47 months (range, 24-104). RESULTS: 
      Eighty-six percent of the patients were satisfied or very satisfied. The average 
      Constant score increased from 24 to 55 pts (P < .0001) and active anterior 
      elevation from 68° to 121° (P < .0001). Twenty-two of the 29 (76%) associated 
      bone grafts were incorporated in the glenoid. Eight patients (21%) needed a 
      subsequent reoperation because of recurrent or new complications: glenoid 
      loosening (n = 3), prosthetic anterior instability (n = 3), and humeral 
      subsidence (n = 2); the reverse prosthesis had to be converted to a 
      hemiarthroplasty in 1 patient and removed in another. CONCLUSION: Revision with a 
      RSA is a reliable therapeutic option which provides the double benefit of glenoid 
      bone stock reconstruction by fixing the bone graft with the help of the baseplate 
      and screws and of solving the problem of soft tissue insufficiency and prosthetic 
      instability. However, surgeons should be aware that the rate of postoperative 
      complications and subsequent reoperations is high, and that the surgical 
      technique is demanding.

TI  - The placement of skin surface markers for non-invasive measurement of scapular 
      kinematics affects accuracy and reliability.
PG  - 777-85
LID - 10.1007/s10439-010-0185-1 [doi]
AB  - Abnormal scapular movement is widely believed to be an important factor in 
      clinical pathology of the shoulder joint complex. Validated non-invasive 
      techniques for measuring scapular movement have been developed, but the effect of 
      marker placement on accuracy is unknown. The objective of this study was to 
      determine the accuracy and reliability of different groupings of markers to 
      achieve the best accuracy and reliability for measuring scapular kinematics. 
      Eight healthy young adult subjects were recruited. An optoelectronic marker grid 
      was applied to the skin overlying the scapula. Two bone pins with optoelectronic 
      marker carriers were inserted into the scapula. The accuracy of six surface 
      marker configurations was determined by comparing the measured kinematics with 
      scapular bone pins (the gold standard). Four humeral movements were tested: 
      glenohumeral abduction, glenohumeral horizontal adduction, hand behind back, and 
      forward reaching. All three rotations had a significant difference in the 
      accuracy of the patches (p = 0.04 to p < 0.0001). For posterior tipping there was 
      a significant effect of movement (p = 0.003) and a significant interaction 
      (p < 0.0001). There was also a significant interaction for external rotation 
      (p = 0.001). The marker grouping with the largest cranio-caudal spread had the 
      highest accuracy for measuring posterior tilting (RMS 1.9°). Markers closer to 
      the scapular spine were more accurate for tracking external rotation (RMS 2.0°) 
      while an intermediate grouping of markers were most accurate for quantifying 
      upward rotation (RMS 1.9°). The reliability between days ranged between 3.8° and 
      7.5° (based on RMS difference between trials) and there was a significant 
      interaction between patch and movement (p < 0.0001). Intraclass correlation 
      coefficients show moderate to good agreement for most arm movements and scapular 
      rotations. Thus, there exists distinct optimal configurations of non-invasive 
      marker locations for accurately measuring scapular kinematics.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to establish the reliability for measuring 
      scapular muscle thickness, and to examine how scapular muscle thickness changes 
      with respect to external loads. Participants were asymptomatic subjects recruited 
      from a sample of convenience. Thickness Measures were taken using rehabilitative 
      ultrasound imaging (RUSI) under 11 conditions, rest and 10 progressive loads, for 
      the Lower Trapezius (LT) and Serratus Anterior (SA). The procedures were repeated 
      1 week later to determine reliability. Bland and Altman limits of agreement and 
      Interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to determine reliability. 
      Separate repeated measure ANOVAs were performed to determine differences in 
      muscle thickness for both muscles across 3 conditions; rest and the 2 loaded 
      conditions that represented the lowest and highest torque values. Results 
      demonstrate good within and between day reliability for the LT (ICC = .86 to .99) 
      and SA (ICC = .88 to .99). For the LT and SA, there were significant differences 
      between the resting thickness and 2 lifting conditions (p ≤ .01) but not between 
      the two lifting conditions. It was concluded that RUSI is reliable in measuring 
      scapular muscle thickness. RUSI is sensitive enough to detect absolute changes in 
      thickness from resting to a contracted state but unable to detect differences 
      between loads imposed on the shoulder.

TI  - A biomechanical analysis of rotator cuff deficiency in a cadaveric model.
PG  - 286-92
AB  - We conducted this cadaveric study to define a biomechanical rationale for rotator 
      cuff function in several deficiency states. A dynamic shoulder testing apparatus 
      was used to examine change in middle deltoid muscle force and humeral translation 
      associated with simulated rotator cuff tendon paralyses and various sizes of 
      rotator cuff tears. Supraspinatus paralysis resulted in a significant increase 
      (101%) in the middle deltoid force required to initiate abduction. This increase 
      diminished to only 12% for full glenohumeral abduction. The glenohumeral joint 
      maintained ball-and-socket kinematics during glenohumeral abduction in the 
      scapular plane with an intact rotator cuff. No significant alterations in humeral 
      translation occurred with a simulated supraspinatus paralysis, nor with 1-, 3-, 
      and 5-cm rotator cuff tears, provided the infraspinatus tendon was functional. 
      Global tears resulted in an inability to elevate beyond 25 degrees of 
      glenohumeral abduction despite a threefold increase in middle deltoid force. 
      These results validated the importance of the supraspinatus tendon during the 
      initiation of abduction. Glenohumeral joint motion was not affected when the 
      "transverse force couple" (subscapularis, infraspinatus, and teres minor tendons) 
      remained intact. Significant changes in glenohumeral joint motion occurred only 
      if paralysis or anatomic deficiency violated this force couple. Finally, this 
      model confirmed that rotator cuff disease treatment must address function in 
      addition to anatomy.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of the latarjet procedure for large glenoid defects by 
      computed tomography: a coracoid graft can sufficiently restore the glenoid arc.
PG  - 1099-107
LID - 10.1177/0363546515570030 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coracoid transfer to a large glenoid defect is considered an 
      excellent method to restore the surface area of the anteroinferior glenoid. 
      However, there is little quantitative evidence supporting whether a coracoid 
      graft can sufficiently restore the glenoid arc. PURPOSE: To assess whether the 
      Latarjet procedure can sufficiently restore the surface area of the glenoid. 
      STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: A total of 44 patients 
      who underwent a Latarjet operation for a large glenoid defect between February 
      2009 and July 2011 were enrolled in this study. Three-dimensional computed 
      tomography was used to calculate the surface areas of the preoperative glenoid 
      defect size and the reconstructed glenoid. Preoperative and postoperative 
      clinical results also were assessed. RESULTS: At the last follow-up, the mean 
      visual analog scale score for instability during motion improved significantly 
      from 5.1 points (range, 3-10 points) preoperatively to 1.3 points (range, 0-4 
      points) (P<.001). The mean deficit in external rotation at the side, external 
      rotation at 90° of abduction, and internal rotation to the posterior were 
      10°±20°, 7°±16°, and 1.9°±4°, respectively (P=.004, .022, and .009, 
      respectively). The overall recurrence rate was 4.5% (2 of 44 shoulders). The mean 
      preoperative glenoid defect size was 157±38 mm2 (range, 141-239 mm2; 25.3%±6% of 
      the intact glenoid surface). The mean surface area of the coracoid graft used for 
      reconstruction was 152±34 mm2 (range, 146-236 mm2; 24.8%±5% of the intact glenoid 
      surface). After the Latarjet procedure, the mean surface area of the 
      reconstructed glenoid was 706±32 mm2 (range, 639-749 mm2). Finally, postoperative 
      glenoid defect size was 5±11 mm2 (range, 3-28 mm2; 1.5%±2% of the intact glenoid 
      surface). CONCLUSION: The Latarjet procedure can provide satisfactory outcomes, 
      including a low recurrence rate and reliable functional recovery. Defects at the 
      anteroinferior glenoid were restored to nearly normal after coracoid transfer by 
      use of the Latarjet procedure, which is an anatomically matched reconstruction.

TI  - Reconstruction of massive uncontained glenoid defects using a combined 
      autograft-allograft construct with reverse shoulder arthroplasty: preliminary 
      results.
PG  - 925-34
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2011.07.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This report documents our experiences with a new technique for 
      reconstructing massive uncontained defects of the glenoid with reverse total 
      shoulder arthroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use a modified deltopectoral 
      approach to perform the combined allograft-autograft construct glenoid 
      reconstruction. We make use of a peripherally seated cortical allograft acting as 
      a sleeve bushing to provide a stable ring under compression in which to house 
      impacted cancellous autograft centrally for early incorporation and in-growth 
      with the long-peg Aequalis (Tornier, Saint-Ismier Cedex, France) reverse total 
      shoulder arthroplasty baseplate. RESULTS: Our case series now comprises 10 
      patients with postoperative follow-up of up to 36 months. We report the first 5 
      patients here, all of whom have more than 12 months of follow-up. Computed 
      tomography scanning demonstrates incorporation of the graft as early as 6 months. 
      None of these patients have had loosening, implant failures, dislocations, 
      periprosthetic fractures, or infections. One patient sustained an acromial stress 
      fracture that was successfully treated nonoperatively, and 1 patient has 
      nonprogressive grade I notching. CONCLUSION: The hybrid graft glenoid 
      reconstruction is a useful and versatile technique in the setting of massive 
      uncontained defects of the glenoid and permits the implantation of a reverse 
      total shoulder arthroplasty. We believe this technique is reproducible and uses 
      materials that are both readily available and familiar.

TI  - Use of vertebral levels to measure presumed internal rotation at the shoulder: a 
      radiographic analysis.
PG  - 299-306
AB  - Internal rotation of the shoulder is frequently measured by noting the maximal 
      vertebral level reached by the patient's thumb, but it is not at all certain that 
      this maneuver is strictly measuring internal rotation. We analyzed this maneuver 
      with computed tomographic scans of the shoulder in differing positions. We also 
      analyzed extension of the glenohumeral joint and scapulothoracic articulation 
      with scapular lateral radiographs. Finally, we used posteroanterior radiographs 
      to analyze elbow flexion at the limits of internal rotation behind the back. We 
      found that maximal internal rotation behind the back occurs in approximately a 2 
      : 1 ratio between the glenohumeral joint and the scapulothoracic articulation. 
      However, the scapulothoracic articulation was more significant in placing the arm 
      behind the back, whereas the glenohumeral joint performed most of the internal 
      rotation in front of the body. The scapulothoracic articulation assists in this 
      motion by both extension and internal rotation of the scapula on the thorax. The 
      limits of internal rotation behind the back are reached with a significant 
      contribution from elbow flexion. We conclude that measuring shoulder internal 
      rotation by the maximal vertebral level reached by the patient's thumb greatly 
      oversimplifies the concept of internal rotation and that limitations in this 
      motion may not be strictly due to a loss of internal rotation at the glenohumeral 
      joint.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scapular dyskinesis is observed in subjects with pathologic 
      conditions of the shoulder; however, there is limited information about the 
      factors related to scapular dyskinesis among participants in rugby. The purpose 
      of this study was to investigate the incidence, reliability, and relationships 
      between scapular dyskinesis and variables related to the shoulder in high-school 
      rugby players. METHODS: A total of 164 Japanese high-school rugby players were 
      evaluated with questionnaires, physical examinations, and a video analysis during 
      their preseason. After evaluation of the inter-rater reliability of a 
      classification of scapular dyskinesis, the outcomes were analyzed to assess the 
      relationships between scapular dyskinesis and other variables during the 
      preseason. The data were assessed with a logistic regression analysis calculating 
      the odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: The inter-rater reliability among 3 blinded 
      observers based on the Fleiss κ value and percentage agreement was .52 and 79.0%, 
      respectively, which indicates that the method is moderately reliable. Scapular 
      dyskinesis was identified in 16 (10.1%) shoulders among 159 players, with type I 
      being prominent. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a type 
      I dyskinesis was significantly associated with a past history of stingers with 
      projected pain to the affected side of the shoulder (OR, 3.7) and the player's 
      competitive grade at the time of the survey (OR, 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: Scapular 
      dyskinesis is significantly associated with a past history of stingers. This 
      suggests that stingers are a causative factor of scapular dyskinesis in the rugby 
      population. Our method of evaluating scapular dyskinesis in collision athletes 
      exhibits moderate reliability.

TI  - [Technique and diagnostic value of musculoskelatal ultrasonography in 
      rheumatology. Part 5: Ultrasonography of the shoulder].
PG  - 577-89
AB  - Shoulder-related symptoms are very common in rheumatic diseases. For the 
      evaluation of the diagnosis as well as for therapy and prognosis, an anatomic 
      assignment is essential. Clinical investigations alone are often not capable to 
      do this. Ultrasonography is a method to delineate bony surfaces as well as the 
      soft tissues around the shoulder joints statically and even dynamically. For the 
      purpose of rheumatic diseases, ultrasound standard scans help to detect the 
      lesions at the biceps tendon, the bursae, the rotator cuff, the humeral head as 
      well as in the acromial and sternoclavicular joints. Considering the limitations 
      of the method (obesity, frozen shoulder, no findings under bony structures) and 
      knowing the pitfalls and errors of the method, ultrasonography is a reliable, 
      quick and low cost method for the diagnosis of rheumatic shoulder joint 
      pathology. Compared to computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, 
      ultrasonography should be used as a screening method. The following standard 
      scans are suggested for sonographic evaluation of the shoulder: 1) anterior 
      transverse scan and 2) anterior longitudinal scan at the bicipal groove to detect 
      synovitis and tenosynovitis, 3) anterior transverse scan at the coracoacromiale 
      window in the neutral position, 4) at maximal external rotation and 5) at maximal 
      internal rotation to evaluate the rotator cuff, bursitis, synovitis and erosions, 
      6) anterior longitudinal scan at 90 degrees to the coracoacomiale window at 
      maximal internal rotation to describe these findings in an additional dimension, 
      7) anterior-lateral longitudinal scan at the anterior lateral acromion to 
      tuberculum majus to evaluate the distal part of the supraspinatus muscle, 8) 
      posterior transverse scan at the fossa infraspinata lateral under the spina 
      scapulae, 9) axillary longitudinal scan to evaluate synovitis, synovial 
      proliferation, erosions at the humeral head, lesions at the glenoidale labrum, 
      10) anterior transverse scan at the acromioclavicular joint and 11) anterior 
      oblique scan at the sternoclavicular joint to detect synovitis, synovial 
      proliferation, erosion, osteophytes.

TI  - Glenoid spherical orientation and version.
PG  - 3-11
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2010.05.012 [doi]
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Glenoid orientation likely plays an important role in shoulder 
      mechanics and has been associated with glenohumeral instability, rotator cuff 
      tears, and total shoulder arthroplasty outcome. Glenoid version and inclination 
      measurements are widely used, but these measurements are 2-dimensional, and 
      orientation of the central face must be inferred from 2 points on the outer rim. 
      This study tested the hypothesis that sphere fitting provides an optimal 
      assessment of glenoid face 3-dimensional orientation, and clinically important 
      differences will exist in some individuals between sphere fit orientation and 
      traditional version measurement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computed tomography scans 
      of 20 normal glenoids were obtained. Glenoid version was measured from resliced, 
      pure transverse images at a series of glenoid heights. Separately, the 
      3-dimensional surface of each glenoid face was reconstructed. A sphere was fit to 
      the glenoid face, and its orientation was described by 2 angles analogous to 
      version and inclination. RESULTS: "Sphere fit version" averaged -3.2° ± 3.4° 
      (negative indicating retroversion), and "sphere fit inclination" averaged 1.3° ± 
      4.7°. Absolute differences between sphere fit version and the standard 
      mid-glenoid version averaged 1.5° (maximum 4.0°) across patients. The glenoids 
      were, on average, 5.5° more retroverted at the 80% height than at the 20% height. 
      DISCUSSION: Three-dimensional aspects of the glenoid, including the spiraling 
      twist evidenced by increased retroversion superiorly, are accounted for in this 
      novel sphere-fitting approach for assessing glenoid orientation. CONCLUSIONS: For 
      most normal glenoids, midglenoid version appears to provide an adequate measure 
      of glenoid central face orientation. Sphere fitting has potential utility in 
      optimizing glenoid implant alignment in total shoulder arthroplasty.

TI  - Method for determining the spatial position of the shoulder with ultrasound-based 
      motion analyzer.
PG  - 79-88
AB  - Several methods have been developed recently for the analysis of the spatial 
      motion of the scapula and the arm, whereby the spatial position of shoulder bones 
      is determined in static conditions by interrupting motion. The authors have 
      developed a 3D motion analysis method recording scapular motion in progress with 
      appropriate accuracy in the course of arm movements of various degrees. The 
      objective of this study is to explore the applicability of the method developed, 
      as well as to compare it with and verify it by other methods developed earlier. 
      The position and displacements of shoulder bones were determined on 30 shoulders 
      of 15 healthy people. The newly developed measurement method is based on the 
      mechanical basic principle stating that the position and motion of a rigid body 
      -- in this case, the bones (segments) forming the shoulder joint -- can be 
      calculated at any moment from the spatial coordinates of three points of a 
      segment and any changes thereof in the course of motion. Ultrasound-based 
      triplets providing the three points (fundamental points) by a segment as required 
      for measurement were fixed on the sternum (modeling the trunk), the clavicle, the 
      acromion (modeling the scapula), the upper arm, and the lower arm. The position 
      of the sixteen anatomical points involved in the study were determined by an 
      ultrasound-based pointer in the local coordinate system specified by the 
      fundamental points before starting measurements. The ZEBRIS ultrasound-based 
      motion analysis system was used for measuring the spatial coordinates of triplets 
      in the course of continuous motion. The spatial coordinates of the designated 
      anatomical points can be calculated by the method of triangulation. The method 
      was calibrated by a ZEBRIS mapping (3DCAD) software commercially available, and 
      the measurement error rate of the method was determined by statistical 
      calculations. On the basis of calibration and error calculations it could be 
      established that the accuracy and the reproducibility of the method were 
      appropriate, in accordance with the limit values to be found in the literature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Late complications after humeral head replacement (HHR) for 
      comminuted proximal humeral fractures are common and may necessitate revision 
      surgery. This study evaluated the outcome of revision surgery of failed 
      post-traumatic HHR with a less medialized reverse shoulder prosthesis. METHODS: 
      Thirty-three patients with failed post-traumatic HHR due to rotator-cuff 
      insufficiency and glenoid erosion, but with sufficient preservation of the 
      glenoid bone stock to permit primary stability of an inverted glenoid implant, 
      underwent revision using the Bayley-Walker reverse shoulder prosthesis (Stanmore 
      Implants, Elstree, UK) and were monitored up for a mean of 31 months. Outcome 
      measures included the Oxford Shoulder Score, subjective shoulder value, pain 
      rating, active range of motion, and shoulder radiographs. RESULTS: The average 
      postrevision Oxford Shoulder Score and subjective shoulder value improved from 50 
      ± 6 to 29 ± 11 and from 23 ± 19 to 51 ± 23, respectively (P < .001). Pain level 
      decreased from 6.2 ± 2.1 to 1.4 ± 2.0 (P < .001). Active forward flexion 
      increased from 34° ± 22° to 63° ± 30° and external rotation from 11° ± 14° to 20° 
      ± 16°(P < .01). More patients were able to use their affected arm to reach a 
      functional triangle consisting the mouth, opposite armpit, and ipsilateral 
      buttock after revision (24% vs 73%; P < .001). Seven patients (21%) had 
      postrevision complications. No glenoid loosening or scapular notching occurred. 
      CONCLUSION: Revision of failed post-traumatic HHR with the Bayley-Walker shoulder 
      offers reliable pain relief and improvement in shoulder function with a 
      complication rate similar to other reverse prostheses. Nevertheless, revision 
      shoulder arthroplasty remains challenging with a high rate of complications.

TI  - Posturo-kinetic organisation during the early phase of voluntary upper limb 
      movement. 1. Normal subjects.
PG  - 956-65
AB  - The nature and organisation of anticipatory postural adjustments (APA) associated 
      with the early phase of a voluntary upper limb movement were studied. Upper limb 
      elevations, performed at maximal velocity, were studied according to three 
      conditions: bilateral flexions (BF) and unilateral flexions without and with an 
      additional inertia (respectively OUF and IUF). Activities of the anterior part of 
      the deltoid (DA) and of main muscles of the lower limbs, pelvis, trunk and 
      scapular girdle were recorded by surface electromyography. 
      Miniature-accelerometers enabled the recording of the tangential acceleration of 
      the arm at wrist level (Aw) and the antero-posterior accelerations of various 
      body links. Systematic investigations allow a precise description of the 
      segmental phenomena which precede the onset of the voluntary movement. Before the 
      activation of the anterior deltoid, a sequence of EMG modifications occurred in 
      muscles of lower limbs, pelvis and trunk. The onset of Aw was preceded by 
      anticipatory local accelerations of all the body links. Anticipatory EMG 
      activities and local accelerations were organised according to patterns which 
      were specific to the forthcoming voluntary movement. By comparing anticipatory 
      EMG activities with anticipatory local accelerations, the nature of anticipatory 
      postural movements can be determined. They appear to counteract the disturbing 
      effects of the forthcoming voluntary movement. Because of their reproducibility 
      and specificity, the anticipatory postural movements can be considered as 
      preprogrammed. Postural adjustments and voluntary movement appear to be parts of 
      the same motor program. Anticipatory postural movements should result from 
      muscular functional synergies selected from a pre-evaluation of the perturbative 
      aspects of the forthcoming movement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The success of Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA) is believed to 
      depend on the restoration of the natural anatomy of the joint and a key 
      development has been the introduction of modular humeral components to more 
      accurately restore the patient's anatomy. However, there are no peer-reviewed 
      studies that have reported the degree of glenoid component mal-position achieved 
      in clinical practice and the clinical outcome of such mal-position. The main 
      purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of glenoid implant positioning 
      during TSA and to relate it to the radiological (occurrence of radiolucent lines 
      and osteolysis on CT) and clinical outcomes. METHODS: 68 TSAs were assessed with 
      a mean follow-up of 38+/-27 months. The clinical evaluation consisted of 
      measuring the mobility as well as of the Constant Score. The radiological 
      evaluation was performed on CT-scans in which metal artefacts had been 
      eliminated. From the CT-scans radiolucent lines and osteolysis were assessed. The 
      positions of the glenoid and humeral components were also measured from the CT 
      scans. RESULTS: Four position glenoid component parameters were calculated The 
      posterior version (6°±12°; mean ± SD), the superior tilt (12°±17°), the rotation 
      of the implant relative to the scapular plane (3°±14°) and the off-set distance 
      of the centre of the glenoid implant from the scapular plane (6±4 mm). An 
      inferiorly inclined implant was found to be associated with higher levels of 
      radiolucent lines while retroversion and non-neutral rotation were associated 
      with a reduced range of motion. CONCLUSION: this study demonstrates that glenoid 
      implants of anatomic TSA are poorly positioned and that this malposition has a 
      direct effect on the clinical and radiological outcome. Thus, further 
      developments in glenoid implantation techniques are required to enable the 
      surgeon to achieve a desired implant position and outcome.

TI  - Ultrasound measurements on acromio-humeral distance and supraspinatus tendon 
      thickness: test-retest reliability and correlations with shoulder rotational 
      strengths.
PG  - 284-91

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To establish the test-retest reliability of ultrasound measurements 
      on acromio-humeral distance (AHD) and supraspinatus tendon thickness; and to 
      explore their relationships with shoulder rotational strengths. DESIGN: 
      Test-retest observational study. METHODS: Thirty-seven individuals (age: 21.5±1.4 
      years) participated in this study. Twenty-four were University volleyball players 
      with 15 healthy and 9 players with shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS). Thirteen 
      participants were healthy untrained individuals. Ultrasound measurements of AHD 
      and supraspinatus tendon thickness were taken, and isokinetic testing of 
      concentric shoulder internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) at a speed 
      of 90°/s was performed. RESULTS: The measurement of the AHD and the supraspinatus 
      tendon thickness indicated excellent reliability (ICC=0.922, and ICC=0.933 
      respectively), and the minimum detectable difference (MDD) were 2.10mm and 0.64 
      mm respectively. A cut-off AHD distance of 23.9 mm had a sensitivity of 0.67 and 
      specificity of 0.71 (area under curve (AUC): 0.70; p=0.05) in identifying 
      individuals with and without SIS. Hence, individuals with AHD larger than 23.9 mm 
      had greater possibility of having SIS. Positive correlations were found in AHD 
      with supraspinatus tendon thickness (r=0.36, p<0.05) and shoulder external 
      rotational strengths (r=0.47-0.62, all p<0.05) and ER/IR ratios (r=0.56-0.58, all 
      p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound measurements of AHD and tendon thickness have 
      excellent reliability. The reported cut-off AHD highlighted the potential role of 
      ultrasound measurements in volleyball players for early identification of SIS. 
      The AHD was related to the supraspinatus tendon thickness and shoulder external 
      rotation strengths. Our findings provide a scientific basis for muscle training 
      in overhead athletes such as volleyball players.

      motion analysis.
PG  - 751-4
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.11.017 [doi]
AB  - The most recent non-invasive methods for the recording of scapular motion are 
      based on an acromion marker (AM) set and a single calibration (SC) of the scapula 
      in a resting position. However, this method fails to accurately measure scapular 
      kinematics above 90° of arm elevation, due to soft tissue artifacts of the skin 
      and muscles covering the acromion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      accuracy, and inter-trial and inter-session repeatability of a double calibration 
      method (DC) in comparison with SC. The SC and DC data were measured with an 
      optoelectronic system during arm flexion and abduction at different angles of 
      elevation (0-180°). They were compared with palpation of the scapula using a 
      scapula locator. DC data was not significantly different from palpation for 5/6 
      axes of rotation tested (Y, X, and Z in abduction and flexion), where as SC 
      showed significant differences for 5/6 axes. The root mean square errors ranged 
      from 2.96° to 4.48° for DC and from 6° to 9.19° for SC. The inter-trial 
      repeatability was good to excellent for SC and DC. The inter-session 
      repeatability was moderate to excellent for SC and moderate to good for DC. 
      Coupling AM and DC is an easy-to-use method, which yields accurate and reliable 
      measurements of scapular kinematics for the complete range of arm motion. It can 
      be applied to the measurement of shoulder motion in many fields (sports, 
      orthopaedics, and rehabilitation), especially when large ranges of arm motion are 
      required.

      during provocative tests.
PG  - 580-5

AB  - The acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) is a common source of pain and disability. 
      Several provocative tests are used to diagnose ACJ lesions. The aim of this study 
      was to evaluate anatomic changes of the ACJ using dynamic ultrasonography during 
      provocative tests. Eighty ACJs of 40 healthy volunteers were subjected to dynamic 
      ultrasonographic examinations. Examinations were performed in a resting position 
      and during passive external rotation, cross body adduction, and active 
      compression testing. Deep joint space distance and capsule displacement were 
      measured ultrasonographically. Mean deep joint space distances during cross body 
      adduction (6.4 +/- 1.6 mm) and active compression (6.6 +/- 1.8 mm) testing were 
      significantly smaller than during passive external rotation testing (7.7 +/- 1.7 
      mm, P < 0.01) or rest (8.1 +/- 1.8 mm, P < 0.01). Mean capsule displacements 
      during active compression (3.5 +/- 0.8 mm) and cross body adduction (3.4 +/- 0.7 
      mm) testing were significantly greater than those during passive external 
      rotation testing (2.9 +/- 0.7 mm, P < 0.01) or rest (2.5 +/- 0.7 mm, P < 0.01). 
      Dynamic ultrasonography revealed that the cross body adduction and active 
      compression tests applied more stress to the ACJ than the passive external 
      rotation test, which suggests that these two tests are likely to be more useful 
      provocative tests for the diagnosis of ACJ lesions. Furthermore, the dynamic 
      properties of ultrasonography could be used to estimate the suitability and 
      validity of provocative tests in other musculoskeletal diseases.

TI  - Relationship between performance of selected scapular muscles and scapular 
      abduction in standing subjects.
PG  - 470-6; discussion 476-9
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between muscular forces 
      generated by the middle trapezius and pectoralis minor muscles and the position 
      of the scapula in relaxed standing. The muscular forces of 60 subjects were 
      measured in standard manual muscle testing positions with a hand-held 
      dynamometer. Scapular abduction in standing was measured with a tape measure. 
      Each measurement was taken twice, and the measurements were shown to be reliable. 
      The correlation between scapular abduction and middle trapezius muscle force was 
      .20. The correlation between scapular abduction and pectoralis minor muscle force 
      was .14. The correlation between scapular abduction and a ratio of middle 
      trapezius muscle force to pectoralis minor muscle force was .01. The results 
      indicate that no relationship exists between the position of the scapula in 
      standing subjects and the muscular force produced by the middle trapezius and 
      pectoralis minor muscles. Clinical practices based on an assumed relationship 
      between these variables (eg, the practice of using middle trapezius muscle 
      strengthening exercises to correct a forward shoulder position) should be 
      reexamined in light of these findings.

TI  - Rehabilitation of reaching after stroke: comparing 2 training protocols utilizing 
      trunk restraint.
PG  - 697-705
LID - 10.1177/1545968308315998 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Task-related training (TRT) but not resistive exercise 
      (RE) was found to improve the path of the hand of a hemiparetic upper extremity 
      when reaching to targets. Forward movement of the trunk, however, compensated for 
      the poststroke motor impairment. Prior studies also demonstrated that short-term 
      practice of reaching to grasp objects with truncal motion restrained (compared to 
      unrestrained practice) increased elbow extension, lessened compensatory trunk 
      movement, and improved interjoint coordination during performance with the trunk 
      unrestrained. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of TRT and RE on unrestrained 
      reaching following extended practice in which compensatory truncal motion was 
      limited. METHODS: Using a restraining device to reduce movement of the trunk, 
      hemiparetic patients with moderately severe motor impairment were given 12 
      sessions over 4 weeks of TRT (n = 5) or RE (n = 6). Reaching when the trunk was 
      not restrained to targets located ipsilateral, midline, and contralateral to the 
      impaired arm was tested before and 2 days after training by 3D kinematic 
      analyses. RESULTS: After both training protocols, kinematic analysis showed that 
      trunk flexion decreased (P < .01, eta(2) = .53) scapular motion shifted toward 
      protraction (P < .01, eta(2) = .57) and elbow extension increased (P < .04, 
      eta(2) = .39). Only after TRT did the path of the hand straighten (P < .02, 
      eta(2) = .46), deceleration time decrease (P < .03, eta(2) = .44), and, at the 
      difficult ipsilateral target, shoulder flexion increase (P < .03, eta( 2) = .31). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Training that restricted compensatory truncal motion during TRT 
      improved the precision of reaching more than during RE. Truncal restraint during 
      rehabilitation of reaching may be an effective therapeutic strategy in patients 
      with moderately severe hemiparetic stroke, especially when combined with TRT.

TI  - A three-dimensional morphometric analysis of upper forelimb morphology in the 
      enigmatic tapir (Perissodactyla: Tapirus) hints at subtle variations in locomotor 
      ecology.
PG  - 1469-1485
LID - 10.1002/jmor.20588 [doi]
AB  - Forelimb morphology is an indicator for terrestrial locomotor ecology. The limb 
      morphology of the enigmatic tapir (Perissodactyla: Tapirus) has often been 
      compared to that of basal perissodactyls, despite the lack of quantitative 
      studies comparing forelimb variation in modern tapirs. Here, we present a 
      quantitative assessment of tapir upper forelimb osteology using three-dimensional 
      geometric morphometrics to test whether the four modern tapir species are 
      monomorphic in their forelimb skeleton. The shape of the upper forelimb bones 
      across four species (T. indicus; T. bairdii; T. terrestris; T. pinchaque) was 
      investigated. Bones were laser scanned to capture surface morphology and 3D 
      landmark analysis was used to quantify shape. Discriminant function analyses were 
      performed to reveal features which could be used for interspecific 
      discrimination. Overall our results show that the appendicular skeleton contains 
      notable interspecific differences. We demonstrate that upper forelimb bones can 
      be used to discriminate between species (>91% accuracy), with the scapula proving 
      the most diagnostic bone (100% accuracy). Features that most successfully 
      discriminate between the four species include the placement of the cranial angle 
      of the scapula, depth of the humeral condyle, and the caudal deflection of the 
      olecranon. Previous studies comparing the limbs of T. indicus and T. terrestris 
      are corroborated by our quantitative findings. Moreover, the mountain tapir T. 
      pinchaque consistently exhibited the greatest divergence in morphology from the 
      other three species. Despite previous studies describing tapirs as functionally 
      mediportal in their locomotor style, we find osteological evidence suggesting a 
      spectrum of locomotor adaptations in the tapirs. We conclude that modern tapir 
      forelimbs are neither monomorphic nor are tapirs as conserved in their locomotor 
      habits as previously described. J. Morphol. 277:1469-1485, 2016. © 2016 Wiley

TI  - Open fixation of acute anterior glenoid rim fractures with bioresorbable pins: 
      analysis of clinical and radiological outcome.
PG  - 953-61
LID - 10.1007/s00402-015-2242-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was a detailed analysis of clinical and 
      radiological results following open fixation of acute-traumatic, displaced 
      anterior glenoid rim fractures with bioresorbable pins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      This retrospective study included 17 patients with glenoid defect sizes ≥20 %, as 
      directly measured in preoperative sagittal en face CT. The mean glenoid defect 
      size was 25.3 % (20-35, SD 4.7). Two or three polylactid pins were used for 
      fixation. Mean age of patients at the time of surgery was 50.1 years (27-71). The 
      mean follow-up period was 6.2 years (2.0-11.1). Follow-up included comprehensive 
      objective and subjective evaluation of shoulder function as well as standard 
      radiographs. RESULTS: The majority of 15/17 patients obtained good or excellent 
      clinical results according to the absolute and normalized Constant score, the 
      Rowe score, the Oxford shoulder score, the simple shoulder test, the shoulder 
      pain and disability index and the subjective shoulder value. Quality of life 
      (SF-36) showed reference values. Mean or subitem values of all outcome measures 
      did not differ from the contralateral, uninjured side. Radiographically, all 
      fractures healed without secondary dislocation. Radiological signs of 
      glenohumeral arthritis developed in two patients and progressed in two other 
      patients. There were no implant-related complications. No patient experienced 
      glenohumeral instability or had to undergo revision surgery. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Bioresorbable pin fixation is a feasible and safe method of osteosynthesis for 
      anterior glenoid rim fractures up to a glenoid defect size of about 35 % and 
      enables immediate active range of motion. Good or excellent clinical outcome can 
      be expected and glenohumeral stability is reliably restored. The most common mid- 
      and long-term complication is occurrence or progression of osteoarthritis. The 
      major benefits of bioresorbable pin fixation are redundancy of implant removal, 
      minimal risk of implant-related complications and early functional 
      rehabilitation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was (1) to determine the relationships between the 
      degree of forward scapular posture and the pectoralis minor index, the strength 
      of the serratus anterior, the thoracic spine angle, and posterior shoulder 
      tightness, and (2) to identify predictors of forward scapular posture, including 
      posterior shoulder tightness. The study recruited eighteen subjects with forward 
      scapular posture and objectively measured the acromion distance, the pectoralis 
      minor index, and the strength of the serratus anterior muscle of each 
      participant. The amount of glenohumeral horizontal adduction and internal 
      rotation were evaluated to measure posterior shoulder tightness. There were high 
      intra-rater reliabilities in all measurements. The measurement results showed a 
      statistically strong negative correlation between the degree of forward scapular 
      posture and the pectoralis minor index. They also revealed a moderate positive 
      correlation between the degree of forward scapular posture and the thoracic spine 
      angle and a moderate negative relationship between the degree of forward scapular 
      posture and the amount of the glenohumeral horizontal adduction. A multiple 
      regression analysis indicated that a total multiple regression model explained 
      93% of the amount of forward scapular posture. All predictor variables, including 
      posterior shoulder tightness, should be considered while assessing, managing, and 
      preventing forward scapular posture.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Rotations of the Scapula During Arm Abduction: Evaluation of

AB  - Noninvasive methods enabling measurement of shoulder bone positions are paramount 
      in clinical and ergonomics applications. In this study, the acromion marker 
      cluster (AMC) method is assessed in comparison with a model-based approach 
      allowing scapula tracking from low-dose biplanar radiograph images. Six healthy 
      male subjects participated in this study. Data acquisition was performed for 6 
      arm abduction positions (0°, 45°, 90°, 120°, 150°, 180°). Scapula rotations were 
      calculated using the coordinate systems and angle sequence was defined by the 
      ISB. The comparison analysis was based on root mean square error (RMSE) 
      calculation and nonparametric statistical tests. RMSE remained under 8° for 0° to 
      90° arm abduction and under 13.5° for 0° to 180° abduction; no significant 
      differences were found between the 2 methods. Compared with previous works, an 
      improved accuracy of the AMC approach at high arm abduction positions was 
      obtained. This could be explained by the different sources of data used as the 
      "gold standard."

AB  - In biomechanical modeling of the shoulder, it is important to know the 
      orientation of each bone in the shoulder girdle when estimating the loads on each 
      musculoskeletal element. However, because of the soft tissue overlying the bones, 
      it is difficult to accurately derive the orientation of the clavicle and scapula 
      using surface markers during dynamic movement. The purpose of this study is to 
      develop two regression models which predict the orientation of the clavicle and 
      the scapula. The first regression model uses humerus orientation and individual 
      factors such as age, gender, and anthropometry data as the predictors. The second 
      regression model includes only the humerus orientation as the predictor. 
      Thirty-eight participants performed 118 static postures covering the volume of 
      the right hand reach. The orientation of the thorax, clavicle, scapula and 
      humerus were measured with a motion tracking system. Regression analysis was 
      performed on the Euler angles decomposed from the orientation of each bone from 
      26 randomly selected participants. The regression models were then validated with 
      the remaining 12 participants. The results indicate that for the first model, the 
      r(2) of the predicted orientation of the clavicle and the scapula ranged between 
      0.31 and 0.65, and the RMSE obtained from the validation dataset ranged from 
      6.92° to 10.39°. For the second model, the r(2) ranged between 0.19 and 0.57, and 
      the RMSE obtained from the validation dataset ranged from 6.62° and 11.13°. The 
      derived regression-based shoulder rhythm could be useful in future biomechanical 
      modeling of the shoulder.

TI  - Reliability of scapular classification in examination of professional baseball 
      players.
PG  - 1540-4
LID - 10.1007/s11999-011-2216-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinically evaluating the scapulothoracic joint is challenging. To 
      identify scapular dyskinesis, clinicians typically observe scapular motion and 
      congruence during self-directed upper extremity movements. However, it is unclear 
      whether this method is reliable. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore determined the 
      interrater reliability of a scapular classification system in the examination of 
      professional baseball players. METHODS: Seventy-one healthy uninjured 
      professional baseball players between the ages of 18 and 32 years volunteered to 
      participate. We used a digital video camera to film five repetitions of scapular 
      plane elevation while holding a 2-pound weight. Four examiners then independently 
      classified the motions on video into one of four types. Interrater reliability 
      analysis using the kappa (k) statistic was performed for: (1) classifying each 
      scapula into one of the four types; (2) classifying each scapula as being 
      abnormal (Types I-III) or normal (Type IV); and (3) classifying both scapula as 
      both being symmetric (both normal or both abnormal) or asymmetric (one normal, 
      one abnormal). RESULTS: We found low reliability for all analyses. In classifying 
      each scapula as one of the four types, reliability was k = 0.245 for the left 
      limb and k = 0.186 for the right limb. When considering the dichotomous 
      classifications (abnormal versus normal), reliability was k = 0.264 for left and 
      k = 0.157 for right. For bilateral symmetry/asymmetric, reliability was k = 
      0.084. CONCLUSION: We found low reliability of visual observation and 
      classification of scapular movement. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Current evaluation 
      strategies for evaluating subtle scapular abnormalities are limited. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Level III, diagnostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete 
      description of levels of evidence.

      different radiographic acromial characteristics, including shape, index, and 
      presence of a spur. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 216 patients enrolled 
      in an ongoing prospective, longitudinal study investigating asymptomatic rotator 
      cuff tears were reviewed. All patients underwent standardized radiographic 
      evaluation, clinical evaluation, and shoulder ultrasonography at regularly 
      scheduled surveillance visits. Three blinded observers reviewed all radiographs 
      to determine the acromial morphology, presence, and size of an acromial spur, as 
      well as the acromial index. These findings were analyzed to determine an 
      association with the presence of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. RESULTS: The 
      3 observers demonstrated poor agreement for acromial morphology (κ = 0.41), 
      substantial agreement for the presence of an acromial spur (κ = 0.65), and 
      excellent agreement for the acromial index (κ = 0.86). The presence of an 
      acromial spur was highly associated with the presence of a full-thickness rotator 
      cuff tear (P = .003), even after adjusting for age. No association was found 
      between the acromial index and rotator cuff disease (P = .92). CONCLUSION: The 
      presence of an acromial spur is highly associated with the presence of a 
      full-thickness rotator cuff tear in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The 
      acromial morphology classification system is an unreliable method to assess the 
      acromion. The acromial index shows no association with the presence of rotator 
      cuff disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To calculate the Scapular Balance Angle (SBA) reference values in a 
      healthy population between 18 and 85 years old, and to define abnormality 
      criteria for this sample. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive study was 
      conducted on a total of 300 individuals (mean age: 44.83, range: 18-83; 
      proportion male/female: 1.59), calculating the SBA through manual measurement 
      with a goniometer. An intraobserver Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of 
      0.87 and a interobserver ICC of 0.84 was observed. RESULTS: The values for the 
      SBA in healthy population were 2.505 ± 2.340°. We define the abnormality criteria 
      for this sample with an angle greater than 7.185°. DISCUSSION: SBA manual 
      measurement is a simple and reproducible assessment of the position and rotation 
      of the scapula in clinical practice. The main findings of this study are the 
      reference values for the SBA and a statistical cut-off to define abnormality.

TI  - Physiological asymmetry of trunk ranging and pelvis motility: an 
      anatomo-functional study in 80 healthy subjects.
PG  - 85-91
AB  - A key feature in physiotherapeutic treatment of patients with motion disturbances 
      is the appropriate ranging of the trunk and pelvis motility. Eighty subjects 
      randomly selected and free from known pathology of the muscular-skeletal and/or 
      of the neurological system classed into four groups according to the age and the 
      sex have been assessed, by using a new, simple and easy administrable tool. Our 
      results demonstrate that the new measurement tool showed a very low intra- and 
      inter-observer variability, that healthy subjects showed a more adduced and 
      elevated right scapula if compared to the contralateral one and, as regard as the 
      pelvic motion, a broader joint excursion in passive motion compared with active 
      motion in the overall group, a broader joint excursion in young subjects compared 
      with elderly ones, and a broader joint excursion in female subjects compared with 
      males subjects. In conclusion our study allowed to identify a range of 
      physiological asymmetry and pelvis motility. Such a range of physiological 
      asymmetry might be useful as a reference for the physiotherapists.

AB  - Patient-specific biomechanical models including patient-specific finite-element 
      (FE) models are considered potentially important tools for providing personalized 
      healthcare to patients with musculoskeletal diseases. A multi-step procedure is 
      often needed to generate a patient-specific FE model. As all involved steps are 
      associated with certain levels of uncertainty, it is important to study how the 
      uncertainties of individual components propagate to final simulation results. In 
      this study, we considered a specific case of this problem where the uncertainties 
      of the involved steps were known and the aim was to determine the uncertainty of 
      the predicted strain distribution. The effects of uncertainties of three 
      important components of patient-specific models, including bone density, 
      musculoskeletal loads and the parameters of the material mapping relationship on 
      the predicted strain distributions, were studied. It was found that the number of 
      uncertain components and the level of their uncertainty determine the uncertainty 
      of simulation results. The 'average' uncertainty values were found to be 
      relatively small even for high levels of uncertainty in the components of the 
      model. The 'maximum' uncertainty values were, however, quite high and occurred in 
      the areas of the scapula that are of the greatest clinical relevance. In 
      addition, the uncertainty of the simulation result was found to be dependent on 
      the type of movement analysed, with abduction movements presenting consistently 
      lower uncertainty values than flexion movements.

AB  - Alterations in scapular muscle activity have been theorized to contribute to 
      abnormal scapular motion and shoulder pain, but pose challenges to quantify in 
      the clinic. Rehabilitative Ultrasound Imaging (RUSI) has proved useful 
      identifying dysfunction of lumbar regional stabilizing muscle activity, 
      specifically contractile behavior. Although, recent examinations of scapular 
      stabilizing trapezius muscle function using RUSI did not detect alterations 
      individuals with shoulder pain or differences in muscle thickness between varying 
      external loads in asymptomatic individuals, a potential confounder to prior 
      results, scapular dyskinesis has not been controlled. It is unknown if dyskinesis 
      alters scapular muscle thickness during activation measured with RUSI. Thus, the 
      purpose of this study was to compare change in scapular muscle thickness between 
      individuals with and without scapular dyskinesis. Thirty-nine asymptomatic adults 
      with (n = 19) and without (n = 20) scapular dyskinesis, defined with a reliable 
      and validated method, participated. Two separate ultrasound images of the 
      serratus anterior (SA) and lower trapezius (LT) were captured under two 
      randomized conditions, rest and isometric contraction against gravity, and saved 
      for blinded measurement. Change in thickness with contraction was calculated and 
      expressed as a percentage. The dyskinesis group demonstrated a greater increase 
      (p = 0.005) in LT thickness with the isometric contraction than the group without 
      (mean difference = 31.6%; 95%CI = 10.3, 53.0). No differences in SA or resting 
      thickness of either muscle were found between groups. The presence of scapular 
      dyskinesis alters thickness changes of the lower trapezius during activation. 
      Furthermore, potential underlying reasons beyond muscle contractile behavior must 
      be considered.

TI  - Glenohumeral motion in patients with rotator cuff tears: a comparison of 
      asymptomatic and symptomatic shoulders.
PG  - 6-11
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a relationship 
      between altered scapular plane glenohumeral kinematics end shoulder pain. 
      Subjects were divided into 3 groups: normal volunteers (n = 10), patients with 
      symptomatic rotator cuff tears severe enough to warrant surgery (n = 10), and 
      subjects with no symptoms who had tears documented on magnetic resonance imaging 
      and normal examination (n = 10). Humeral kinematics were observed with a 
      computer-enhanced modification of the Poppen and Walker technique. Scapular plane 
      x-ray films were obtained at 0 degree, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 
      degrees, and 150 degrees of elevation. Measurements were made by 3 independent 
      observers blinded to the diagnosis, and data interpretation was performed based 
      on mean values for independent observers. Results showed a high degree of 
      interobserver and intraobserver reliability (coefficients = 0.96 and 0.95, 
      respectively). The symptomatic and asymptomatic groups showed progressive 
      superior translation of the humeral head on the glenoid with increasing arm 
      elevation. The normal group, in contrast, maintained a constant center of 
      rotation along the geometric center of the glenoid. Symptomatic and asymptomatic 
      rotator cuff tear groups showed superior head migration from 30 degrees to 150 
      degrees, which was significantly different from those seen in the normal group. 
      No significant difference between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups was 
      demonstrated with the small numbers used in this study. The presence of a rotator 
      cuff tear was associated in a disruption of normal glenohumeral kinematics in the 
      scapular plane. Because significant superior migration of the humeral head was 
      seen in both the asymptomatic and symptomatic rotator cuff groups, painless and 
      normal shoulder motion is possible in the presence of abnormal glenohumeral 
      kinematics. Abnormal glenohumeral kinematics alone was not an independent factor, 
      which could explain the occurrence of symptoms.

TI  - Scapular muscle tests in subjects with shoulder pain and functional loss: 
      reliability and construct validity.
PG  - 1128-38
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Scapular muscle performance evaluated with a handheld 
      dynamometer (HHD) has been investigated only in people without shoulder 
      dysfunction for test-retest reliability of data obtained with a single scapular 
      muscle test. The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability, error, and 
      validity of data obtained with an HHD for 4 scapular muscle tests in subjects 
      with shoulder pain and functional loss. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects (N=40) 
      with shoulder pain and functional loss were tested by measuring the kilograms 
      applied with an HHD during 3 trials for muscle tests for the lower trapezius, 
      upper trapezius, middle trapezius, and serratus anterior muscles. Concurrently, 
      surface electromyography (sEMG) data were collected for the 4 muscles. The same 
      procedures were performed 24 to 72 hours after the initial testing by the same 
      tester. Muscle tests were performed 3 times, and the results were averaged for 
      data analysis. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients for intratester 
      reliability of measurements of isometric force obtained using an HHD ranged from 
      .89 to .96. The standard error of the measure (90% confidence interval [CI]) 
      ranged from 1.3 to 2.7 kg; the minimal detectable change (90% CI) ranged from 1.8 
      to 3.6 kg. Construct validity assessment, done by comparing the amounts of 
      isometric muscle activity (sEMG) for each muscle across the 4 muscle tests, 
      revealed that the muscle activity of the upper trapezius and lower trapezius 
      muscles was highest during their respective tests. Conversely, the isometric 
      muscle activity of the middle trapezius and serratus anterior muscles was not 
      highest during their respective tests. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In people with 
      shoulder pain and functional loss, the intrarater reliability and error over 1 to 
      3 days were established using an HHD for measurement of isometric force for the 
      assessment of scapular muscle performance. Error values can be used to make 
      decisions regarding individual patients. Construct validity was established for 
      the lower and upper trapezius muscle tests; therefore, these tests are advocated 
      for use. However, construct validity was not demonstrated for the serratus 
      anterior and middle trapezius muscle tests as performed in this study. Further 
      investigation of these muscle tests is warranted.

TI  - Validity of a computer postural analysis to estimate 3-dimensional rotations and 
      translations of the head from three 2-dimensional digital images.
PG  - 124-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to describe and evaluate the 
      validity/accuracy of the computerized system PosturePrint for measuring head 
      posture. METHODS: Computer analysis was compared with 125 measured positions of a 
      mannequin head in 5 degrees of freedom. For each mannequin position, 3 digital 
      photographs were obtained (left lateral, anteroposterior, and right lateral) and 
      were processed through the PosturePrint computer system. For the head analysis, a 
      headgear with 3 reflective markers was placed on a subject; and there were 
      additional click-on markers at the ear tragus, upper lip, acromioclavicular 
      joints, and episternal notch. Head postures were calculated as lateral 
      translation (T(x)), lateral flexion (R(z)), axial rotation (R(y)), 
      flexion-extension (R(x)), and anterior-posterior translation (T(z)). For an error 
      analysis, PosturePrint algorithm calculations were compared with the true 
      mannequin head positions. Furthermore, average head posture was determined in 
      student volunteers (n = 40). RESULTS: Mean computational errors were R(x) = 1.3 
      degrees (SD 0.6 degrees) and T(z) = 1.1 mm (SD 0.5 mm) for sagittal displacements 
      and R(y) = 1.1 degrees (SD 0.7 degrees), R(z) = 0.6 degrees (SD 0.4 degrees), and 
      T(x) = 1.1 mm (SD 0.5 mm) for frontal view displacements. For the normal group, 
      mean head displacements were 1.1 degrees or less for all rotations and 1 mm or 
      less for lateral translations (T(x)); and forward head posture (T(z)) averaged 3 
      cm. CONCLUSION: From the mannequin positions, small mean errors indicate that the 
      PosturePrint system is accurate. In the future, statistical research determining 
      the correlation between head displacements, neck pain, function, and health 
      status should be performed.

TI  - In Vitro Simulation of Shoulder Motion Driven by Three-Dimensional Scapular and 
      Humeral Kinematics.
LID - 10.1115/1.4053099 [doi]
LID - 051008
AB  - In vitro simulation of three-dimensional (3D) shoulder motion using in vivo 
      kinematics obtained from human subjects allows investigation of clinical 
      conditions in the context of physiologically relevant biomechanics. Herein, we 
      present a framework for laboratory simulation of subject-specific kinematics that 
      combines individual 3D scapular and humeral control in cadavers. The objectives 
      were to: (1) robotically simulate seven healthy subject-specific 3D 
      scapulothoracic and glenohumeral kinematic trajectories in six cadavers, (2) 
      characterize system performance using kinematic orientation accuracy and 
      repeatability, and muscle force repeatability metrics, and (3) analyze effects of 
      input kinematics and cadaver specimen variability. Using an industrial robot to 
      orient the scapula range of motion (ROM), errors with repeatability of ±0.1 mm 
      and <0.5 deg were achieved. Using a custom robot and a trajectory prediction 
      algorithm to orient the humerus relative to the scapula, orientation accuracy for 
      glenohumeral elevation, plane of elevation, and axial rotation of <3 deg mean 
      absolute error (MAE) was achieved. Kinematic accuracy was not affected by varying 
      input kinematics or cadaver specimens. Muscle forces over five repeated setups 
      showed variability typically <33% relative to the overall simulations. Varying 
      cadaver specimens and subject-specific human motions showed effects on muscle 
      forces, illustrating that the system was capable of differentiating changes in 
      forces due to input conditions. The anterior and middle deltoid, specifically, 
      showed notable variations in patterns across the ROM that were affected by 
      subject-specific motion. This machine provides a platform for future laboratory 
      studies to investigate shoulder biomechanics and consider the impacts of variable 
      input kinematics from populations of interest, as they can significantly impact 
      study outputs and resultant conclusions.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes 
      of anatomical double-bundle coracoclavicular (CC) reconstruction using the 
      coracoacromial (CA) ligament and the conjoined tendon for the treatment of 
      chronic acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation. A retrospective evaluation was 
      performed on 18 patients who underwent an anatomical CC reconstruction using the 
      CA ligament and the conjoined tendon for chronic AC joint dislocation. Patients 
      were treated surgically between April 2007 and January 2012. Mean follow-up was 
      35.3 months (range, 24-49 months). All patients were evaluated for functional 
      outcomes using the modified University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder 
      rating scale for chronic AC injury and the Constant-Murley shoulder outcome 
      score. Range of motion and shoulder and elbow strength were also measured. Plain 
      radiographs were taken to evaluate reduction status and CC distance. Mean 
      modified UCLA shoulder rating scale at final follow-up was 18.1 points (range, 
      13-20 points). No significant difference in mean Constant-Murley scores existed 
      between the injured and contralateral shoulders (P=.26). At final follow-up, 15 
      (83.3%) patients had well-maintained reduction and 2 (11.1%) patients had a 
      partial loss of reduction. One other patient had a complete loss of reduction due 
      to a postoperative fall. The CC distance was not significantly different between 
      the injured and contralateral shoulders in the immediate postoperative period 
      (P=.46) or at final follow-up (P=.14). One superficial wound infection occurred 
      and was treated with routine wound care. An anatomical double-bundle CC 
      reconstruction using the CA ligament and the conjoined tendon for the treatment 
      of chronic AC joint dislocation is a reliable surgical method with good results.

AB  - Altered scapular motions premeditate shoulder impingement and other 
      musculoskeletal disorders. Divergent experimental conditions in previous research 
      precludes rigorous comparisons of non-invasive scapular tracking techniques. This 
      study evaluated scapular orientation measurement methods across an expanded range 
      of humeral postures. Scapular medial/lateral rotation, anterior/posterior tilt 
      and protraction/retraction was measured using an acromion marker cluster (AMC), a 
      scapular locator, and a reference stylus. Motion was captured using reflective 
      markers on the upper body, as well as on the AMC, locator and stylus. A 
      combination of 5 arm elevation angles, 3 arm elevation planes and 3 arm axial 
      rotations was examined. Measurement method interacted with elevation angle and 
      plane of elevation for all three scapular orientation directions (p < 0.01). 
      Method of measurement interacted with axial rotation in anterior/posterior tilt 
      and protraction/retraction (p < 0.01). The AMC had strong agreement with the 
      reference stylus than the locator for the majority of humeral elevations, planes 
      and axial rotations. The AMC underestimated lateral rotation, with the largest 
      difference of ∼2° at 0° elevation. Both the locator and AMC overestimated 
      posterior tilt at high arm elevation by up to 7.4°. Misestimations from using the 
      locator could be enough to potentially obscure meaningful differences in scapular 
      rotations.

      concentrated on limb-specific or surgeon-based outcome criteria. We conducted a 
      prospective trial to determine the effect of surgery for rotator cuff disease on 
      general health status. METHODS: Seventy-one patients (fifty of whom were men and 
      twenty-one of whom were women) with a mean age of 56.1 years were enrolled in the 
      study. In addition to routine clinical and radiographic evaluation, all patients 
      completed the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health-status questionnaire and five 
      limb-specific questionnaires preoperatively and at six, twelve, eighteen, and 
      twenty-four months postoperatively. All patients had a standard open 
      acromioplasty and resection of the subacromial bursa. Thirty-one patients had 
      repair of an associated rotator cuff tear. Sixty-seven patients (94 percent) 
      completed the study; the remaining four patients were lost to follow-up. RESULTS: 
      The preoperative SF-36 scores for physical function (60.6, p = 0.02), role 
      function-physical (20.8, p = 0.001), pain (38.6, p = 0.003), physical component 
      summary (37.0, p = 0.001), and mental component summary (45.6, p = 0.02) were 
      significantly decreased compared with normative data. The preoperative 
      limb-specific scores also were low. At the time of the most recent follow-up 
      evaluation, there was improvement that approached or reached significance both in 
      the limb-specific scores (p < or = 0.0026) and in the general-health-status 
      scores for pain (p = 0.0001), role function-physical (p = 0.06), vitality (p = 
      0.01), and physical component summary (p = 0.01). The presence of a rotator cuff 
      tear had a significant negative effect on limb-specific scores both 
      preoperatively (p = 0.04) and postoperatively (p = 0.05). Although operative 
      treatment of rotator cuff disease led to improved scores, patients who had filed 
      a Workers' Compensation claim had lower limb-specific and SF-36 scores both 
      preoperatively (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01, respectively) and postoperatively (p = 
      0.01 and p = 0.005, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for chronic rotator cuff 
      disease reliably and significantly improves general health status.

TI  - Evaluating the acromion marker cluster as a method for measuring scapular 
      orientation in children with brachial plexus birth palsy.
PG  - 128-33
LID - 10.1123/jab.2012-0180 [doi]
AB  - Several studies have described using an acromion marker cluster for measuring 
      scapular orientation in healthy adults performing planar motions. It is unknown 
      whether the acromion marker cluster method will provide the same level of 
      accuracy in children with brachial plexus birth palsy. This study compared this 
      method to palpation for calculating scapular orientation in children with 
      brachial plexus birth palsy performing clinically relevant movements. Scapular 
      orientation in ten patients was determined by palpation and an acromion marker 
      cluster in neutral and six Modified Mallet positions. RMSEs and mean relative 
      errors were calculated. Resultant RMSEs ranged from 5.2 degrees to 21.4 degrees. 
      The averages of the mean relative errors across all positions for each axis were 
      177.4% for upward/downward rotation, 865.0% for internal/external rotation, and 
      166.2% for anterior/posterior tilt. The acromion marker cluster method did not 
      accurately measure scapular rotation relative to the total movement on an 
      individual or group basis in the population. With most relative errors over 100%, 
      the acromion marker cluster method often produced errors larger than the actual 
      measured motion. The accuracy of the acromion marker cluster method limits its 
      use as a clinical tool for measuring scapular kinematics on children with 
      brachial plexus birth palsy.

TI  - A new subject-specific skin correction factor for three-dimensional kinematic 
      analysis of the scapula.
PG  - 121009
LID - 10.1115/1.4000284 [doi]
AB  - Noninvasive measurement of scapular kinematics using skin surface markers 
      presents technical challenges due to the relative movement between the scapula 
      and the overlying skin. The objectives of this study were to develop a 
      noninvasive subject-specific skin correction factor that would enable a more 
      accurate measurement of scapular kinematics and evaluate this new technique via 
      comparison with a gold standard for scapular movement. Scapular kinematics were 
      directly measured using bone pins instrumented with optoelectronic marker 
      carriers in eight healthy volunteers while skin motion was measured 
      simultaneously with optoelectronic markers attached to the skin surface overlying 
      the scapula. The relative motion between the skin markers and the underlying 
      scapula was estimated over a range of humeral orientations by palpating and 
      digitizing bony landmarks on the scapula and then used to calculate correction 
      factors that were weighted by humeral orientation. The scapular kinematics using 
      these correction factors were compared with the kinematics measured via the bone 
      pins during four arm movements in the volunteers: abduction, forward reaching, 
      hand behind back, and horizontal adduction. The root-mean-square (rms) errors for 
      the kinematics determined from skin markers without the skin correction factors 
      ranged from 5.1 deg to 9.5 deg while the rms errors with the skin correction 
      factors ranged from 1.4 deg to 3.0 deg. This technique appeared to perform well 
      for different movements and could possibly be extended to other applications.

AB  - Quantitative motion analysis protocols have been developed to assess the 
      coordination between scapula and humerus. However, the application of these 
      protocols to test whether a subject's scapula resting position or pattern of 
      coordination is "normal", is precluded by the unavailability of reference 
      prediction intervals and bands, respectively. The aim of this study was to 
      present such references for the "ISEO" protocol, by using the non-parametric 
      Bootstrap approach and two parametric Gaussian methods (based on Student's T and 
      Normal distributions). One hundred and eleven asymptomatic subjects were divided 
      into three groups based on their age (18-30, 31-50, and 51-70). For each group, 
      "monolateral" prediction bands and intervals were computed for the 
      scapulo-humeral patterns and the scapula resting orientation, respectively. A 
      fourth group included the 36 subjects (42 ± 13 year-old) for whom the 
      scapulo-humeral coordination was measured bilaterally, and "differential" 
      prediction bands and intervals were computed, which describe right-to-left side 
      differences. Bootstrap and Gaussian methods were compared using cross-validation 
      analyses, by evaluating the coverage probability in comparison to a 90% target. 
      Results showed a mean coverage for Bootstrap from 86% to 90%, compared to 67-70% 
      for parametric bands and 87-88% for parametric intervals. Bootstrap prediction 
      bands showed a distinctive change in amplitude and mean pattern related to age, 
      with an increase toward scapula retraction, lateral rotation and posterior tilt. 
      In conclusion, Bootstrap ensures an optimal coverage and should be preferred over 
      parametric methods. Moreover, the stratification of "monolateral" prediction 
      bands and intervals by age appears relevant for the correct classification of 
      patients.

TI  - The assessment of scapular radiographs: analysis of anteroposterior radiographs

PG  - 1114-20
LID - 10.1302/0301-620X.95B8.30631 [doi]
AB  - The glenopolar angle assesses the rotational alignment of the glenoid and may 
      provide prognostic information and aid the management of scapula fractures. We 
      have analysed the effect of the anteroposterior (AP) shoulder radiograph 
      rotational offset on the glenopolar angle in a laboratory setting and used this 
      to assess the accuracy of shoulder imaging employed in routine clinical practice. 
      Fluoroscopic imaging was performed on 25 non-paired scapulae tagged with 2 mm 
      steel spheres to determine the orientation of true AP views. The glenopolar angle 
      was measured on all the bony specimens rotated at 10° increments. The mean 
      glenopolar angle measured on the bone specimens in rotations between 0° and 20° 
      and thereafter was found to be significantly different (p < 0.001). We also 
      obtained the AP radiographs of the uninjured shoulder of 30 patients treated for 
      fractures at our centre and found that none fitted the criteria of a true AP 
      shoulder radiograph. The mean angular offset from the true AP view was 38° (10° 
      to 65°) for this cohort. Radiological AP shoulder views may not fully project the 
      normal anatomy of the scapular body and the measured glenopolar angle. The 
      absence of a true AP view may compromise the clinical management of a scapular 
      fracture.

      notching?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this cohort study was to compare scapular notching 
      rates, range of motion, and functional outcomes between patients who underwent a 
      standard Grammont-style reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) and patients who 
      underwent bony increased-offset reverse shoulder arthroplasty (BIO-RSA) at a 
      minimum of 2 years' follow-up. We hypothesized that the BIO-RSA cohort would have 
      lower notching rates and improved rotational range of motion; however, validated 
      outcome scores between cohorts would be no different. METHODS: A comparative 
      cohort study was designed after a sample size calculation. A total of 40 patients 
      were studied with 20 in each cohort (RSA vs BIO-RSA). All patients underwent an 
      interview and physical examination. Outcomes included range of motion; shoulder 
      strength; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score; American 
      Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score; Simple Shoulder Test score; Constant score; 
      and Global Rating of Change scale score. Radiographs were obtained for all 
      patients and examined for scapular notching. RESULTS: When we compared 
      demographic characteristics between the standard RSA and BIO-RSA cohorts, 
      including age, sex, and follow-up duration, there were no significant differences 
      between groups (P > .05). In addition, there were no significant differences 
      between cohorts when we compared forward elevation (P = .418); external rotation 
      (P = .999); internal rotation (P = .071); strength (P > .376); Disabilities of 
      the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score (P = .229); American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons 
      score (P = .579); Simple Shoulder Test score (P = .522); Constant score (P = 
      .917); or Global Rating of Change scale score (P = .167). The frequency of 
      scapular notching, however, was significantly higher (P = .022) in the RSA cohort 
      than in the BIO-RSA cohort: 75% versus 40%. CONCLUSIONS: Although the scapular 
      notching rate was significantly higher in the standard RSA group, no other 
      outcome measures were statistically different, including range of motion, 
      strength, and validated outcome scores.

TI  - The scapular glenopolar angle: standard values and side differences.
PG  - 1583-7
LID - 10.1007/s00256-014-1977-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine normal glenopolar angle (GPA) 
      values on bone specimens of the scapula and compare them with various 
      radiological views and CT examination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: GPA values were 
      measured on 100 mature, dry, non-paired scapulae, 20 pairs of dry scapulae, 50 AP 
      radiographs of the shoulder, 50 Neer I views, 50 AP chest radiographs and 20 3D 
      CT reconstructions of the scapula. RESULTS: Measurements made on bone specimens 
      of the scapula showed an average GPA value of 42.3°; the mean absolute 
      side-to-side difference was on average 1.6°. The average GPA measured on 50 AP 
      shoulder radiographs was 35.9°, on Neer I views 40.6° and AP chest radiographs 
      37.1°, with the mean absolute side-to-side difference on average 4.9°; on 3D CT 
      the average GPA was 43.0° and the mean absolute side-to-side difference on 
      average 1.4°. CONCLUSION: GPA values depend on the method of measurement used. 
      Measurements made on 3D CT reconstructions and Neer I views showed almost the 
      same values as those measured on bone specimens. The values measured on AP 
      shoulder views and AP chest radiographs were statistically significantly lower. 
      Side-to-side variability (right and left) measured on 3D CT reconstructions was 
      insignificant, and the obtained values corresponded to the values from bone 
      specimens. Therefore, the best method to measure the GPA is a 3D CT 
      reconstruction and an exact Neer I projection.

TI  - Development and Multisite Assessment of a Novel Shoulder Motion Joint Simulator.
LID - 071006 [pii]
LID - 10.1115/1.4053362 [doi]
AB  - Multiple biomechanical shoulder simulators have been described in the literature, 
      with a trend toward increasing complexity to better simulate clinical scenarios. 
      Our objective was to develop an advanced, novel shoulder joint simulator and 
      compare outcomes at two separate institutions, for a typical shoulder joint 
      motion simulation. Identical shoulder simulators were developed & deployed at 
      both institutions. Eight cadaveric upper extremities were tested by simulating 
      actively controlled, arm elevation in the plane of the scapula for two sequential 
      test conditions (intact and nondestructive simulated cuff-tear), each repeated 
      for a total of five trials. Muscle forces and joint translations were recorded 
      for both conditions. The intact condition was repeated following simulated 
      cuff-tear to assess effect of testing order. Statistical analyses were aimed at 
      assessing repeatability and reproducibility of results within specimens, between 
      specimens, and between institutions. The highest average forces were observed for 
      the middle deltoid (233N or 32.5% body weight (BW)), followed by infraspinatus 
      (99.0N), and posterior deltoid (93.7N) muscles. Differentiation between test 
      conditions was unhindered by variability between repeated trials. Data from 
      testing repeated over time, and between the two institutions were not 
      significantly different. The novel shoulder simulator produced repeatable results 
      with low trial-to-trial variation and outcomes were comparable between the two 
      institutions. The results demonstrated a consistent response in muscle forces and 
      humeral translation for the simulated rotator cuff tear condition. Such advanced 
      shoulder simulators could thus be used for evaluating and optimizing surgical 
      interventions and implant strategies.

TI  - Three-dimensional finite element analysis of glenoid replacement prostheses: a 
      comparison of keeled and pegged anchorage systems.
PG  - 430-6
AB  - Glenoid component loosening is the dominant cause of failure in total shoulder 
      arthroplasty. It is presumed that loosening in the glenoid is caused by high 
      stresses in the cement layer. Several anchorage systems have been designed with 
      the aim of reducing the loosening rate, the two major categories being "keeled" 
      fixation and "pegged" fixation. However, no three-dimensional finite element 
      analysis has been performed to quantify the stresses in the cement or to compare 
      the different glenoid prosthesis anchorage systems. The objective of this study 
      was to determine the stresses in the cement layer and surrounding bone for 
      glenoid replacement components. A three-dimensional model of the scapula was 
      generated using CT data for geometry and material property definition. Keeled and 
      pegged designs were inserted into the glenoid, surrounded by a 1-mm layer of bone 
      cement. A 90 deg arm abduction load with a full muscle and joint load was 
      applied, following van der Helm (1994). Deformations of the prosthesis, stresses 
      in the cement, and stresses in the bone were calculated. Stresses were also 
      calculated for a simulated case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in which bone 
      properties were modified to reflect that condition. A maximum principal 
      stress-based failure model was used to predict what quantity of the cement is at 
      risk of failure at the levels of stress computed. The prediction is that 94 
      percent (pegged prosthesis) and 68 percent (keeled prosthesis) of the cement has 
      a greater than 95 percent probability of survival in normal bone. In RA bone, 
      however, the situation is reversed where 86 percent (pegged prosthesis) and 99 
      percent (keeled prosthesis) of the cement has a greater than 95 percent 
      probability of survival. Bone stresses are shown to be not much affected by the 
      prosthesis design, except at the tip of the central peg or keel. It is concluded 
      that a "pegged" anchorage system is superior for normal bone, whereas a "keeled" 
      anchorage system is superior for RA bone.

TI  - [Arthroscopic resection of the acromioclavicular joint. Indications--surgical 
      technique--outcome].
PG  - 691-6
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to present our experience and results with 
      arthroscopic resection of the acromioclavicular joint. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 115 
      patients out of 128 patients could be reevaluated with an average follow-up of 
      2.8 years. The average patient age was 47.8 years. No patient suffered from a 
      complete rotator cuff tear (type C). In 92 cases ARAC was combined with 
      arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD). The average age of this subgroup 
      was 50.2 years. In 23 patients we performed only an ARAC. These patients had an 
      average age of 31.8 years. At follow-up the patients were evaluated by a modified 
      Constant-Score, a Taft-Score as well as with a visual analog scale (VAS). All 
      patients had standardized x-rays for documentation of joint stability as well as 
      for documentation the amount of bone resection. RESULTS: The Taft-score at time 
      of follow up reached 9.8 +/- 1.5 points for the total group. In those patients, 
      we had only performed the ARAC the Taft-score reached 10.7 +/- 1.8 points. The 
      same tendency could be documented with the Constant-score. While the 
      Constant-score of the entire group was 82.3 +/- 12.4, patients after ARAC alone 
      scored 93.5 +/- 14.8. The parameters of the Constant-score showed improvement of 
      pain during motion as well as of pain at rest. Power, range of motion as well as 
      bearing weights were not limited prior to surgery and therefore did not show 
      further improvement. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that ARAC is a standardized 
      and reproducible procedure. Patients with unstable joints, however, should not 
      undergo ARAC alone but rather in combination with a stabilizing procedure.

TI  - Outcome of glenoid neck fractures.
PG  - 585-90
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the outcome of extraarticular glenoid neck 
      fractures with respect to glenoid neck malunion and rotator cuff injury. These 
      fractures are often considered to have a favorable outcome if treated 
      conservatively. More recent studies reveal that the outcome is not uniformly 
      good, but the cause of poor outcomes has not been investigated. Our study 
      identified 9 patients who had sustained a glenoid neck fracture of the scapula 
      within the last 10 years and who were treated conservatively with immobilization 
      and then early active motion. Their functional and anatomic outcomes were 
      analyzed by clinical examination and validated scoring systems, including the 
      Oxford questionnaire and Constant score. Plain radiography and magnetic resonance 
      imaging were correlated to outcome. None of the 9 patients were pain-free, and 
      some had poor Oxford and Constant scores. Pain was associated with glenoid neck 
      malunion and evidence of subacromial bursitis or rotator cuff tendinopathy (or 
      both).

TI  - Influence of glenoid component design and humeral component retroversion on 
      internal and external rotation in reverse shoulder arthroplasty: a cadaver study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A common disadvantage of reverse shoulder arthroplasty is limitation 
      of the range of arm rotation. Several changes to the prosthesis design and 
      implantation technique have been suggested to improve rotation range of motion 
      (ROM). HYPOTHESIS: Glenoid component design and degree of humeral component 
      retroversion influence rotation ROM after reverse shoulder arthroplasty. MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: The Aequalis Reversed™ shoulder prosthesis (Tornier Inc., Edina, MN, 
      USA) was implanted into 40 cadaver shoulders. Eight glenoid component 
      combinations were tested, five with the 36-mm sphere (centred seating, eccentric 
      seating, inferior tilt, centred with a 5-mm thick lateralised spacer, and centred 
      with a 7-mm thick lateralised spacer) and three with the 42-mm sphere (centred 
      with no spacer or with a 7-mm or 10-mm spacer). Humeral component position was 
      evaluated with 0°, 10°, 20°, 30°, and 40° of retroversion. External and internal 
      rotation ROMs to posterior and anterior impingement on the scapular neck were 
      measured with the arm in 20° of abduction. RESULTS: The large glenosphere (42 mm) 
      was associated with significantly (P<0.05) greater rotation ROMs, particularly 
      when combined with a lateralised spacer (46° internal and 66° external rotation). 
      Rotation ROMs were smallest with the 36-mm sphere. Greater humeral component 
      retroversion was associated with a decrease in internal rotation and a 
      significant increase (P<0.05) in external rotation. The best balance between 
      rotation ROMs was obtained with the native retroversion, which was estimated at 
      17.5° on average in this study. DISCUSSION: Our anatomic study in a large number 
      of cadavers involved a detailed and reproducible experimental protocol. However, 
      we did not evaluate the variability in scapular anatomy. Earlier studies of the 
      influence of technical parameters did not take humeral component retroversion 
      into account. In addition, no previous studies assessed rotation ROMs. 
      CONCLUSION: Rotation ROM should be improved by the use of a large-diameter 
      glenosphere with a spacer to lateralise the centre of rotation of the 
      gleno-humeral joint, as well as by positioning the humeral component at the 
      patient's native retroversion value.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of classic anteroinferior bony Bankart lesions by 
      radiography and computed tomography.
PG  - 112-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: An anteroinferior osseous defect of the glenoid rim is sometimes 
      encountered in patients with recurrent anterior dislocations of the shoulder. A 
      defect of more than 21% of the glenoid length is reported to cause instability 
      after Bankart repair. HYPOTHESIS: We can estimate the critical size of glenoid 
      defects by using radiography or computed tomography. STUDY DESIGN: A controlled 
      laboratory study. METHODS: Osseous defects of 0%, 9%, 21%, 34%, and 46% of the 
      glenoid length were created stepwise in 12 cadaveric scapulae, and plain 
      radiographs simulating the axillary and West Point views and computed tomographic 
      images were obtained. The maximum width of the remnant glenoid was measured under 
      each condition and expressed as a percentage of the width of the intact glenoid. 
      RESULTS: A 21% defect appeared to be 18.6% of the intact glenoid on the West 
      Point view. With computed tomography, a 21% defect resulted in loss of 50% of the 
      width on a single slice across the lower one-fourth of the glenoid. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We can estimate the size of a glenoid defect by using the West Point radiographic 
      view or computed tomogram. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These images gave decisive 
      information as to whether an osseous glenoid defect required bone grafting to 
      achieve stability after Bankart repair.

TI  - Biomechanical evaluation of different designs of glenospheres in the SMR reverse 
      total shoulder prosthesis: range of motion and risk of scapular notching.
PG  - 354-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2009.01.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty is a treatment option for cuff 
      tear arthropathy. Scapular notching remains a concern. This biomechanical study 
      compared the range-of-motion in different designs of glenospheres and hence the 
      relative risk of scapular notching. METHOD: A precision coordinate device was 
      used to investigate four different designs of glenospheres (SMR prosthesis); 36 
      mm concentric (Standard), 36 mm eccentric, 44 mm concentric, and 44 mm eccentric 
      glenospheres. The centre of rotation in each design was first established. The 
      position of the humeral prosthesis was recorded in the plane of the scapula to 
      compare the degree of adduction and the total range-of-motion. RESULTS: Eccentric 
      glenospheres were found to improve range-of-motion by allowing a higher degree of 
      adduction. Larger diameter glenospheres were found to improve range-of-motion by 
      increasing adduction and abduction. Compared to the 36 mm concentric (standard) 
      glenosphere, the 36 mm eccentric glenosphere improved adduction by 14.5 degrees, 
      the 44 mm concentric glenosphere improved adduction by 11.6 degrees, the 44 mm 
      eccentric glenosphere improved adduction by 17.7 degrees. CONCLUSION: Eccentric 
      glenospheres with a center-of-rotation placed more inferiorly were shown to 
      improve adduction. This design may reduce the clinical incidence of scapular 
      notching.

PG  - 3232-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.07.034 [doi]
AB  - In this study, the standard-sequence properties of a joint coordinate system were 
      implemented for the glenohumeral joint by the use of a set of instantaneous 
      geometrical planes. These are: a plane that is bound by the humeral long axis and 
      an orthogonal axis that is the cross product of the scapular anterior axis and 
      this long axis, and a plane that is bounded by the long axis of the humerus and 
      the cross product of the scapular lateral axis and this long axis. The relevant 
      axes are updated after every decomposition of a motion component of a humeral 
      position. Flexion, abduction and rotation are then implemented upon three of 
      these axes and are applied in a step-wise uncoupling of an acquired humeral 
      motion to extract the joint coordinate system angles. This technique was 
      numerically applied to physiological kinematics data from the literature to 
      convert them to the joint coordinate system and to visually reconstruct the 
      motion on a set of glenohumeral bones for validation.

TI  - Errors Associated With Utilizing Prescribed Scapular Kinematics to Estimate 
      Unconstrained, Natural Upper Extremity Motion in Musculoskeletal Modeling.
PG  - 469-473
LID - 10.1123/jab.2016-0346 [doi]
AB  - Musculoskeletal modeling is capable of estimating physiological parameters that 
      cannot be directly measured, however, the validity of the results must be 
      assessed. Several models utilize a scapular rhythm to prescribe kinematics, yet 
      it is unknown how well they replicate natural scapular motion. This study 
      evaluated kinematic errors associated with a model that employs a scapular rhythm 
      using 2 shoulder movements: abduction and forward reach. Two versions of the 
      model were tested: the original MoBL ARMS model that utilizes a scapular rhythm, 
      and a modified MoBL ARMS model that permits unconstrained scapular motion. Model 
      estimates were compared against scapulothoracic kinematics directly measured from 
      motion capture. Three-dimensional scapulothoracic resultant angle errors 
      associated with the rhythm model were greater than 10° for abduction (mean: 
      16.4°, max: 22.4°) and forward reach (mean: 11.1°, max: 16.5°). Errors generally 
      increased with humerothoracic elevation with all subjects reporting greater than 
      10° differences at elevations greater than 45°. Errors associated with the 
      unconstrained model were less than 10°. Consequently, use of the original MoBL 
      ARMS model is cautioned for applications requiring precise scapulothoracic 
      kinematics. These findings can help determine which research questions are 
      suitable for investigation with these models and assist in contextualizing model 
      results.

TI  - A new dynamic testing apparatus to study glenohumeral joint motion.
PG  - 869-74
AB  - A dynamic shoulder testing apparatus has been developed to examine unconstrained 
      glenohumeral joint motion in human cadaveric full upper extremities. Six 
      computer-controlled hydraulic cylinders are used to simulate muscle action, while 
      the corresponding tendon excursions and six-degree of freedom joint motion are 
      measured. Trials showed that the testing apparatus creates highly reproducible 
      glenohumeral joint motion in the scapular plane. The apparatus can be used to 
      examine the function of the shoulder musculature and capsuloligamentous 
      structures during normal and pathologic motion at the glenohumeral joint.

TI  - Infraspinatus scapular retraction test: a reliable and practical method to assess 
      infraspinatus strength in overhead athletes with scapular dyskinesis.
PG  - 105-10
LID - 10.1007/s10195-010-0095-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alteration of normal scapulohumeral rhythm due to the fatigue of 
      scapular-stabilizing muscles induces decrease of rotator cuff strength. In this 
      study we analyzed the interobserver and intraobserver realibility of the 
      infraspinatus strength test (IST) and infraspinatus scapular retraction test 
      (ISRT) in 29 overhead athletes with scapular dyskinesis, before and after 6 
      months of scapular musculature rehabilitation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects 
      with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of labral injuries (2 cases, 5%) 
      and cuff tears (4 cases, 11%) were excluded. Scapular dyskinesis patterns were 
      evaluated according to Kibler et al. (J Shoulder Elbow Surg 11:550-556, 2002). We 
      found a type I dyskinesis in 24 cases (83%) and a type II in 5 cases (17%). 
      Patients were tested by using IST and ISRT and the maximum infraspinatus strength 
      (kg) was registered by a handheld dynamometer. Changes in shoulder IR were 
      measured by using a standard goniometry. Rehabilitation continued for 6 months 
      and was focused on the restoration of scapular muscular control and balance. We 
      used a paired Student t test for the significance of the force values (alpha = 
      0.01). Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error (SE) were 
      applied to determine the realibility of repeated values collected within testers 
      and between testers. RESULTS: Values of ICC close to 1 at baseline and at 6 
      months indicated a higher interexaminer and intraexaminer realibility. IST force 
      values registered a significant increase at 6 months for both examiners (P < 
      0.01). The mean difference between IST and ISRT values were not significant at 6 
      months (P > 0.01). The increase of glenohumeral internal rotation was significant 
      at 6 months (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The good realibility and the easy 
      reproducibility make the ISRT an excellent test to assess patients with 
      infraspinatus weakness due to scapular dyskinesis and address them toward an 
      appropriate program of rehabilitation aimed to restore scapular musculature 
      balance and control.

TI  - [The function of passive stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint--a biomechanical 
      study].
PG  - 206-12
AB  - In a biomechanical study we evaluated the passive stabilizing ligaments of 9 
      fresh shoulder specimens with mercury bands. While preparing the specimens we 
      found two interesting entities: there are fibers of the coracohumeral ligament 
      running from the humeral head to the coracoacromial ligament and there was an 
      reproducible thickening in the posterior joint capsule. Functional evaluation 
      shows that the coracohumeral ligament limits external rotation independently of 
      the amount of abduction as well as inferior subluxation. The mediale glenohumeral 
      ligament shows the highest tension in external rotation and 30 degrees abduction. 
      The anterior inferior ligament strengthens the joint capsule in abduction and 
      external rotation. The posterior inferior ligament shows the highest tension in 
      abduction and internal rotation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Immobilization in internal 
      rotation and adduction may lead to shortening of the coracohumeral ligament, 
      which may result in severe limitation of external rotation and abduction. 
      Resection of the coracoacromial ligament relaxes the coracohumeral ligament 
      leading to an increased cranio-caudal instability. The posterior inferior 
      ligament is complementary to the anterior inferior ligament thus stabilizing the 
      shoulder joint in abduction and internal rotation. Sparing this structure in 
      arthroscopy with dorsal portals and restoring in the case of a rupture seems to 
      be of value for a normal joint function.

TI  - Scapular positioning in patients with shoulder pain: a study examining the 
      reliability and clinical importance of 3 clinical tests.
PG  - 1349-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the interobserver reliability, internal consistency, and 
      clinical importance of 3 clinical tests for the assessment of scapular 
      positioning in patients with shoulder pain. DESIGN: Prospective repeated-measures 
      design. SETTING: Private practices for physical therapy and hospital outpatient 
      physical therapy divisions. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-nine patients with shoulder pain 
      who were diagnosed by a physician as having a shoulder disorder. INTERVENTIONS: 
      Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Study participants filled in a visual 
      analog scale for pain and the Shoulder Disability Questionnaire. Next, 2 
      assessors performed the following tests: measurement of the distance between the 
      posterior border of the acromion and the table, measurement of the distance from 
      the medial scapular border to the fourth thoracic spinous processes, and the 
      lateral scapular slide test. RESULTS: The interobserver reliability coefficients 
      were greater than .88 (intraclass correlation coefficients) for the measurement 
      of the distance between the posterior border of the acromion and the table, were 
      greater than .50 for the measurement of the distance from the medial scapular 
      border to the fourth thoracic spinous processes, and were greater than .70 for 
      the lateral scapular slide test. The Cronbach alpha coefficient for internal 
      consistency for all tests was .88. No associations between the outcome of the 
      tests and self-reported pain severity or disability were found. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These data provide evidence favoring the interobserver reliability of 2 of 3 
      tests for the assessment of scapular positioning in patients with shoulder pain. 
      The clinical importance of the tests' outcomes, however, is questionable.

TI  - A comparison of individual joint contributions to multijoint position 
      reproduction acuity in overhead-throwing athletes.
PG  - 466-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measures of joint position sense often test single-axis motions 
      isolating a single joint. Such methods hamper our ability to apply findings to 
      functional multijoint activities. Using a functional, active, multijoint test, we 
      measured upper-extremity position reproduction in overhead-throwers. We compared 
      acuity among four joints and examined individual joint contributions or patterns 
      of contribution among joints to overall task acuity. METHODS: We used an 
      electromagnetic tracking device to measure reproduction of two functional 
      upper-extremity positions. We calculated absolute, constant and variable error at 
      four upper-extremity joints around multiple axes of rotation: three axes at the 
      scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joints and two axes at the elbow and wrist. To 
      represent individual joint acuity, we calculated 3-dimensional variable error. 
      Additional 3-dimensional variable error scores using deviation in hand position 
      (with reference to the thorax) represented overall task acuity. We used principle 
      component analyses to identify contributions of individual joints or patterns of 
      contribution among joints to overall task acuity for absolute, constant and 
      variable error. FINDINGS: Scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joints displayed 
      better acuity compared with elbow and wrist joints. When examined separately, 
      absolute, constant and variable error scores did not indicate any individual 
      joint contributed more to task acuity. When we examined the principle components 
      of all error score measures together, a distinct proximal-to-distal pattern of 
      joint contribution to overall task acuity emerged. INTERPRETATION: Proximal 
      joints display better reposition acuity compared with distal joints, however 
      proximal joints contribute more to acuity of the overall task. Our results 
      indicate that upper-extremity joints do not function independently in 
      repositioning tasks and measures of absolute, constant and variable errors 
      combined over multiple joints may better represent upper-extremity function.

TI  - Reliability of goniometric measurements of active arm elevation in the scapular 
      plane obtained in a clinical setting.
PG  - 1137-44
AB  - Our purpose was to determine the intratester and intertester reliability of 
      measurements of both scapular and glenohumeral rotation during active arm 
      elevation in the scapular plane with a new device, the scapulohumeral goniometer 
      (SHG). Ten physical therapists, with 1 to 29 years of clinical experience, 
      obtained repeated measurements on 45 subjects who were 27 to 82 years old. All 
      subjects were tested in a uniform standing position with the handheld SHG, which 
      was positioned over the subject's scapula and posterior shoulder according to 
      operationally defined landmarks. For both scapular and glenohumeral rotation, 50% 
      of the time the first and second measurements made on a patient by the same 
      physical therapist differed by 3 degrees or more. Ten percent of the time, these 
      measurements differed by 8 degrees or more. Measurements of active range of 
      movement of scapular and glenohumeral rotation made by the same physical 
      therapist during arm elevation in the scapular plane are clinically unacceptable 
      when obtained with the current techniques for positioning the SHG. Clinical 
      decisions based on results of active scapular and humeral motion in the scapular 
      plane as measured on a patient by the same therapist with an SHG should be made 
      with caution, because of the variability associated with this procedure.

TI  - Comparison between tripod and skin-fixed recording of scapular motion.
PG  - 941-6
AB  - Non-invasive dynamical measurements of 3D scapular motion can be performed easily 
      by attachment of a 6 DOF electromagnetic receiver onto the skin above the 
      acromion. To quantify the introduction of possible errors due to skin 
      displacement, we assessed 3D scapular positions on n=8 subjects by both tripod 
      and skin-fixed method. Error analysis included the variables method (tripod, 
      skin-fixed simultaneously with tripod, separate skin-fixed at 0 and 0.25Hz of 
      elevation speed), plane of elevation (0 degrees and 90 degrees ) and observation 
      (receiver replacement: n=3). Inter-individual 'group' differences depended on 
      elevation plane and showed an average underestimation of scapular rotation of 6.5 
      degrees (worst case 13 degrees ) using the skin-fixed method. Only the group 
      RMSE, not the individual RMSE, could be successfully lowered using linear 
      regression (to about 2 degrees ). Inter-trial reliability (RMSE <3.24 degrees , 
      ICC>0.94) and RMSE between 0 and 0.25Hz recordings (about 2.5 degrees ) were 
      satisfactory. Intra-observer RMSE after replacement of the skin-fixed receiver 
      was 5 degrees . The skin-fixed method is suitable for dynamic recordings of 
      scapular rotations; however, measurements are precise only when the acromion 
      receiver is not replaced. Combined with a relatively low accuracy, we conclude 
      that the skin-fixed method should be used only in combination with tripod 
      'calibration'.

TI  - Dynamic tracking of the scapula using skin-mounted markers.
PG  - 823-31
AB  - The shoulder complex is prone to numerous pathologies and instabilities due to 
      its large range of motion. The extent of injury is assessed through a series of 
      observations and physical examinations. It is hypothesized that objective 
      kinematic analysis of the shoulder could yield useful functional insights to aid 
      clinical practice. Non-invasive motion analysis techniques to monitor shoulder 
      function have been developed using passive markers; however, accurate measurement 
      of scapula kinematics is problematic because of overlying tissue. The scapula 
      locator is the accepted standard by which alternative non-invasive techniques of 
      scapula tracking are validated. In this study, the viability of using 
      skin-mounted markers to measure dynamic scapula movement is determined. Complete 
      kinematic descriptions of ten healthy shoulders were obtained. Elevations of the 
      glenohumeral joint were similar with both techniques, indicating that the skin 
      marker method is suitable for gathering functional glenohumeral data. The main 
      differences of note are seen at the scapulothoracic articulation where the skin 
      marker method underestimated lateral rotation by more than 50 degrees at maximum 
      elevation. However, the correlation between the two approaches is greater than 
      0.7, suggesting that it may be possible to derive linear regression models to 
      predict dynamic scapulothoracic lateral rotation accurately using skin-mounted 
      scapula markers.

TI  - How long should arthroscopic clavicular resection be in acromioclavicular 
      arthropathy? A radiological-clinical study (with computed tomography) of 18 cases 
      at a mean 4 years' follow-up.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic clavicular resection is a common procedure, but few 
      studies have analyzed predictive factors for outcome. HYPOTHESES: 1) Computed 
      tomography (CT) of clavicular resection is reproductible; 2) Functional outcome 
      correlates with resection length; 3) Other factors also influence outcome. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients operated on between 2005 and 2010 were called back 
      to establish functional scores (Constant, Simple Shoulder Test [SST], 
      satisfaction) and undergo low-dose bilateral comparative computed tomography (CT) 
      centered on the acromioclavicular joints. The assessment criteria were resection 
      edge parallelism and resection length, measured using OsiriX software. 
      Radiological and clinical data were correlated. RESULTS: 18 out of 21 patients 
      (85%: 3 female, 15 male) were assessed. Mean age at surgery was 49 years (range, 
      40-62 yrs); mean follow-up was 4.2 years (1.6-7.2 yrs). Mean Constant score rose 
      from 57.7 (25-85) to 70.2 (30-96); mean postoperative SST was 9.3 (3-12). 11 
      patients had very good and 4 poor results. CT resection length was reproducible, 
      with intraclass, intra- and interobserver correlation coefficients >95%. There 
      was no significant correlation between articular resection length on CT and 
      functional scores (P=0.2). Functional scores were negatively influenced by an 
      occupational pathologic context (P<0.01) and by associated tendinopathy. 
      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Low-dose CT enabled reproducible analysis of 
      clavicular resection. The hypothesized correlation between resection length and 
      functional result was not confirmed. Work accidents and occupational disease 
      emerged as risk factors. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Single-center retrospective analytic 
      cohort study. Level 4, guideline grade C.

TI  - Orientation feedback during simulated simple translation tests has little 
      clinical significance on the magnitude and precision of glenohumeral joint 
      translations.
PG  - 1194-9
AB  - The repeatability of shoulder instability clinical examinations has been reported 
      to be poor, producing a large range of translations. The objective of this study 
      was to determine the effect of providing the clinician with joint orientation 
      feedback on the magnitude and precision of glenohumeral joint kinematics. A 
      6-degree of freedom magnetic tracking system was used to determine the kinematics 
      of the humerus with respect to the scapula (n=8 cadaveric shoulders). The joints 
      were preconditioned with simple loading tests five times. At 60 degrees of 
      glenohumeral abduction and 0 degrees of flexion/extension, a clinician then 
      applied an anterior and posterior load to the humerus until a manual maximum 
      simulating a simple translation test (STT) was achieved at 0, 30, and 60 degrees 
      of external rotation with and without angular orientation feedback of the humerus 
      with respect to the scapula. The precision for the external rotation was within 
      4.3 degrees for the feedback group and 17.5 degrees for the no feedback group 
      over all external rotations. For achieving the target external rotation of 30 
      degrees , there was a significant difference in precision between the feedback 
      and no feedback groups (p<0.05). The magnitudes of the anterior translations were 
      18.2+/-5.3, 15.5+/-5.1, and 9.9+/-5.5 mm for the feedback group and 19.3+/-6.6, 
      17.5+/-4.9, and 11.5+/-5.3 mm for the no feedback group, at 0, 30, and 60 degrees 
      of external rotation, respectively. There was a significant difference in the 
      precision of anterior translation at 30 and 60 degrees of external rotation for 4 
      of 8 specimens (p<0.05). Significant differences in the precision of the 
      posterior translation was only detected at 0 degrees of external rotation for 3 
      of 8 specimens (p<0.05). Based on the data obtained, providing orientation 
      feedback to a clinician performing a simulated STT results in increased precision 
      for not only the target external rotations but also the resulting glenohumeral 
      translations. While providing feedback may be a necessary step to achieving 
      precise results for experimental studies, the magnitudes of translations in the 
      anterior and posterior directions were relatively similar for the feedback and no 
      feedback states indicating little benefit for clinical examinations.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS AND BACKGROUND: Narrowing of the subacromial space has been implicated 
      in several shoulder pathologies. However, the location of the minimum distance 
      points during clinical testing has not been defined. We sought to measure the in 
      vivo minimum distance and location of the minimum distance points on the acromion 
      and proximal humerus during arm elevation. METHODS: Eight healthy male subjects 
      (mean age, 30 years) underwent a dynamic in vivo biplane fluoroscopy assessment 
      of scaption and forward elevation. For each frame, the 3-dimensional position and 
      orientation of the humerus and scapula were determined, and the acromiohumeral 
      distance (AHD) was measured as the shortest distance between the acromion and 
      proximal humerus. RESULTS: The minimum AHD was 2.6 ± 0.8 mm during scaption and 
      1.8 ± 1.2 mm during forward flexion at elevation angles of 83° ± 13° and 97° ± 
      23°, respectively. The minimum distance point was located on the articular 
      surface of the humeral head from the neutral arm position until 34° ± 8° for 
      scaption and 36° ± 6° for forward flexion. Upon further elevation, the minimum 
      distance point was located within the footprint of the supraspinatus muscle until 
      72° ± 12° for scaption and 65° ± 8° for forward flexion. At greater elevation 
      angles, the minimum distance points were between the acromion and the proximal 
      humeral shaft, distal from the greater tuberosity. CONCLUSIONS: The shortest AHD 
      was at approximately 90° of arm elevation. The AHD was no longer measured 
      intra-articularly or within the supraspinatus footprint above approximately 70° 
      of arm elevation.

TI  - [In vivo measurements of shoulder movements by a goniometer with six degrees of 
      freedom: preliminary study].
PG  - 379-86
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this work was to develop a goniometer with 
      six degrees of freedom (6DOF) to achieve global measurement of the main movements 
      of the shoulder and to examine the reproducibility of the measurements obtained. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Movement amplitudes, inter- and intra-observer 
      reproducibility of the methodology and the device were tested in a population of 
      ten young subjects with asymptomatic shoulders. RESULTS: Maximal amplitudes 
      obtained for each movement were: abduction 111.8 +/- 11 degrees; flexion 127.9 
      +/- 12.7; external rotation 86.3 +/- 14 degrees; free elevation 129.3 +/- 9 
      degrees. The curves traced in the plane of rotation and rotation were plotted 
      against elevation. Comparison between amplitudes on the right and left were not 
      significantly different. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This preliminary study 
      demonstrated the potential contribution of a 6DOF-goniometer for a 3D assessment 
      of shoulder movement. Measurements made when positioning the goniometer 
      demonstrated good reproducibility. Our data are similar to others reported in the 
      literature. The plane of the scapula and the position in physiological internal 
      rotation, as described in the literature, were also observed. Studying shoulder 
      movements, particularly their association, should provide a new means of 
      assessing function in patients with complex disease of the shoulder joint. The 
      device should be helpful in obtaining an objective measurement of the shoulder 
      kinetics that would be useful for patient follow-up and assessment of corporal 
      damage.

TI  - Influence of age on scapulo-thoracic orientation.
PG  - 1009-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scapular activity during shoulder motion is critical for normal 
      shoulder function. With aging, muscle function deteriorates in almost all people, 
      which may lead to shoulder impingement syndrome. METHODS: Forty-four normal 
      subjects, 23 men and 21 women aged from 16 to 73 years with a mean age 48, were 
      enrolled in the study. Static antero-posterior radiography at both 0 degrees and 
      90 degrees of abduction were undertaken and correlation between age and scapular 
      orientations were evaluated by Pearson's correlation coefficient test. The 
      purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between aging and 
      scapulo-thoracic orientation. FINDINGS: Significant correlation coefficients were 
      observed between aging and scapular orientations. With the shoulder at 0 degrees 
      abduction, posterior tilt showed significant negative correlation with aging. At 
      90 degrees abduction, both posterior tilt and upward rotation angle correlated 
      negatively with aging. The correlation was apparent at 90 degrees abduction. 
      INTERPRETATION: The results indicate that shoulder aging closely relates to 
      changes of scapular orientation, which consist of decreases of the posterior tilt 
      at 0 degrees and 90 degrees abduction and the upward rotation angle at 90 
      degrees. The current study indicated that one of the effects of aging on the 
      shoulder is a decrease of posterior tilt and upward rotation angle as seen in an 
      abducted position; and that these alterations are similar to the scapular 
      kinematics of shoulder impingement syndrome. By taking this concept into 
      consideration, the effects of aging on shoulder kinematics can be appropriately 
      evaluated.

TI  - Uncemented metal-back glenoid component in revision of aseptic glenoid loosening: 
      a prospective study of 10 cases with a minimum follow-up of 2 years.
PG  - 785-91
LID - 10.1007/s00402-014-1971-2 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Glenoid component loosening comprises 25 % of all complications 
      related to total shoulder arthroplasties (TSA). This prospective study was 
      undertaken to assess the accuracy of an uncemented metal-back glenoid component 
      in cases of revision of aseptic glenoid loosening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 
      September 2007 and January 2010, a total of ten patients with symptomatic glenoid 
      loosening after TSA (7 cemented and 3 non-cemented) underwent revision surgery 
      with an uncemented metal-back glenoid component (MB). The rotator cuff was 
      functional in all cases. The reconstruction of the glenoid was obtained using an 
      iliac crest graft (8 patients) or synthetic bone substitute (2 patients). The 
      non-cemented glenoid component was fixed into the glenoid native bone, thus 
      stabilizing the graft reconstruction. A clinical and radiological checkup was 
      performed at the long-term follow-up and compared with the preoperative values. 
      The patients were also asked to quantify their pain and satisfaction. RESULTS: 
      There were no intraoperative complications. In all cases, the radiological 
      evaluation showed a good integration of the bone graft with no radiolucency or 
      new glenoid loosening. In one patient, the revision surgery was indicated for the 
      dissociation between MB and polyethylene. After more than 2 years of follow-up, 
      all patients were satisfied or highly satisfied with the outcomes. The pain VAS 
      score (0-10) decreased from 5.1 to 0.6 (p < 0.001). The simple shoulder test 
      increased from 3.4 to 7.9 points (gain 4.5; p < 0.001). The Constant and Murley 
      score increased from 39.4 to 71 points (gain 31.6; p < 0.001). The gain in 
      anterior elevation was 31°, from 118° to 149° (p < 0.001). External rotation 
      elbow to the body (ER1) increased from an average of 34° preoperatively to 47° 
      after surgery (p < 0.001) and external rotation at 90° of abduction from 43° to 
      66° (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that revision with a 
      non-cemented glenoid component associated with a bone graft can solve the 
      difficult challenge of glenoid loosening, provided that the rotator cuff is 
      functional and the glenoid is reconstructable. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE AND STUDY TYPE: 
      Cohort studies (prospective) without controls, Level IV.

AB  - The aim of this study was to measure which three-dimensional spatiotemporal and 
      kinematic parameters differentiate upper limb movement characteristics in 
      children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP) from those in typically developing 
      children (TDC), during various clinically relevant tasks. We used a standardized 
      protocol containing three reach tasks (forwards, upwards, and sideways), two 
      reach-to-grasp tasks (with objects requiring different hand orientations), and 
      three gross motor tasks. Spatiotemporal (movement duration, trajectory 
      straightness, maximum velocity, and timing of maximum velocity), as well as 
      kinematic parameters (discrete angles and waveforms of the trunk, scapula, 
      shoulder, elbow and wrist), were compared between 20 children with HCP (age 10.9 
      ± 2.9 years) and 20 individually age-matched TDC (age 10.9 ± 3.0 years). 
      Kinematic calculations followed the recommendations from the International 
      Society of Biomechanics. Results showed that children with HCP had longer 
      movement durations, less straight hand trajectories, and lower maximum velocities 
      compared to the TDC. Timing of maximum velocity did not differ between both 
      groups. The movement pathology in children with HCP was highlighted by increased 
      trunk movements and reduced shoulder elevation during reaching and 
      reach-to-grasp. We also measured an increased anterior tilting and protraction of 
      the scapula in children with HCP, although differences were not significant for 
      all tasks. Finally, compared to the TDC, children with HCP used less elbow 
      extension and supination and more wrist flexion to execute all tasks. This study 
      reported distinct 3D upper limb movement characteristics in children with HCP and 
      age-matched TDC, establishing the discriminative ability of the measurement 
      procedure. From a clinical perspective, combining spatiotemporal and kinematic 
      parameters may facilitate the identification of the pathological movement 
      patterns seen in children with HCP and thereby add to a well-targeted upper limb 
      treatment planning.

TI  - Reconstruction of C5 and C6 brachial plexus avulsion injury by multiple nerve 
      transfers: spinal accessory to suprascapular, ulnar fascicles to biceps branch, 
      and triceps long or lateral head branch to axillary nerve.
PG  - 131-9
AB  - PURPOSE: In C5 and C6 brachial plexus avulsion lesions, elbow flexion, shoulder 
      abduction, and external rotation are the functions that need to be restored. 
      Because the proximal stumps are not available for grafting, surgical repair is 
      based on nerve transfers. The purpose of this study was to describe and report 
      the results of the use of multiple nerve transfers in the reconstruction of these 
      avulsion injuries. METHODS: Ten patients had multiple nerve transfers: cranial 
      nerve XI to the suprascapular nerve, ulnar nerve fascicles to the biceps motor 
      branch, and triceps long or lateral head motor branch to the axillary nerve. 
      Triceps branch transfer was performed through a posterior arm incision. RESULTS: 
      Two years after surgery, all the patients had recovered full elbow flexion; 7 
      scored M4 and 3 scored M3+ according to Medical Research Council scoring. All the 
      patients had recovered active abduction and external rotation. Abduction recovery 
      averaged 92 degrees (range, 65 degrees-120 degrees) and external rotation, 
      measured from full internal rotation, averaged 93 degrees (range, 80 degrees-120 
      degrees). Shoulder abduction strength was graded M4 in 3 patients and M3 in the 
      remaining 7 patients. Shoulder external rotation strength was graded M4 in 2 
      patients, M3 in 5 patients, and M2 in 3 patients. No donor site deficits were 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed nerve transfers constitute a valid strategy 
      in C5-C6 avulsion injury reconstruction.

PG  - 120-3
AB  - We developed a three-dimensional finite element model of the shoulder 
      glenohumeral joint after shoulder arthroplasty including humerus shaft, scapular, 
      scapular cartilage and eight muscles, while each of the muscles was simulated 
      with 50 spring elements. To reduce the element number and improve the analytical 
      precision, we used mixed tetrahedral and hexahedral elements in the model. We 
      then used the model to calculate the biomechanics of the shoulder glenohumeral 
      joint after hemiarthroplasty during humeral external rotation. Results showed 
      that the maximum joint reaction force was 374.72 N and the maximum contact stress 
      was 6. 573 MPa together with the contact areas at 40 degrees external rotation. 
      These might be one of the reasons for prosthetic disarticulation, and would 
      provide theoretical bases to prosthetic design.

AB  - Palpation of movement is a common clinical tool for assessment of movement in 
      patients with musculoskeletal symptoms. The purpose of this study was to measure 
      the accuracy of palpation of shoulder girdle translation during the medial 
      rotation test (MRT) of the shoulder. The translation of the gleno-humeral and 
      scapulo-thoracic joints was measured using both three-dimensional ultrasound and 
      palpation in order to determine the accuracy of translation tracking during the 
      MRT of the shoulder. Two movements of 11 normal subjects (mean age 24 (SD=4), 
      range 19-47 years) were measured. The agreement between measures was good for 
      scapulo-thoracic translation (r=0.83). Gleno-humeral translation was 
      systematically under estimated (p=0.03) although moderate correlation was found 
      (r=0.65). These results indicate that translation of the measured joints can be 
      tracked by palpation and further tests of the efficacy of palpation tracking 
      during musculoskeletal assessment may be warranted.

TI  - Electromyographic and nerve block analysis of the subscapularis liftoff test.
PG  - 347-55
AB  - The inability to perform the "liftoff" test has been attributed to a 
      subscapularis muscle or tendon injury. The goals of this study were to evaluate 
      the activity of the glenohumeral muscles during performance of the "liftoff" 
      maneuver and to identify the most effective initial upper extremity placement 
      that isolates the subscapularis musculotendinous unit. In the first phase of this 
      study 15 subjects accomplished four proposed versions to the "liftoff" test while 
      their intramuscular electromyographic activity in select glenohumeral muscles was 
      recorded. The second phase of this study assessed the ability of five subjects 
      with a nonfunctional subscapularis musculotendinous unit to perform the same 
      proposed versions. On the basis of electromyographic data none of the proposed 
      versions to the "liftoff" maneuver isolated the upper and lower subscapularis 
      muscle from either the teres major, latissimus dorsi, posterior deltoid, or 
      rhomboid muscles (p > 0.05). In the presence of a nonfunctional subscapularis 
      musculotendinous unit, the subjects were able to perform all of the proposed 
      versions of the "liftoff" maneuver except one: elevation of the dorsum of the 
      hand from the posterior-inferior border of the scapula (maximum internal rotation 
      test). Although significant electromyographic activity was generated in the 
      potentially confounding shoulder girdle muscles during the maximum internal 
      rotation "liftoff" test, a successful test appears to be dependent on the 
      isolated glenohumeral internal rotation function of the subscapularis muscle.

TI  - The repeatability of scapular rotations across three planes of humeral elevation.
PG  - 181-98
AB  - Measurement of scapular kinematics is an important component in the assessment of 
      shoulder function; however, repeatability of these measurements has not been 
      established. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine the 
      repeatability of scapular rotation measures for different humeral elevation 
      planes between trials, sessions, and days. Three-dimensional scapular rotations 
      were collected using an electromagnetic tracking system in three planes of 
      humeral elevation. Coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC) values were 
      calculated between trials, sessions, and days for curves of scapular rotations. 
      CMC values were compared with repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVAs) and 
      Tukey's post-hoc procedures. Tests of simple main effects were performed for 
      significant interaction effects. Our results suggest that scapular rotation 
      measures are repeatable between trials within the same testing session, but less 
      repeatable between testing sessions and days. Sagittal plane elevation 
      consistently yielded the highest CMC values for all scapular rotations. These 
      results suggest sagittal plane elevation should be considered to evaluate 
      differences in scapular rotations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in rotator cuff surgery techniques, re-tear rate 
      remains above 20% and increases with tear severity. Mechanical stresses to 
      failure of repaired tendons have been reported. While optimal immobilization 
      postures were proposed to minimize this stress, post-operative rehabilitation 
      protocols have never been assessed with respect to these values. Purpose was to 
      use musculoskeletal simulation to predict when the stress in repaired tendons 
      exceeds safety limits during passive movements. Hence, guidelines could be 
      provided towards safer post-operative exercises. METHODS: Sixteen healthy 
      participants volunteered in passive three-dimensional shoulder range-of-motion 
      and passive rehabilitation exercises assessment. Stress in all rotator cuff 
      tendons was predicted during each movement by means of a musculoskeletal model 
      using simulations with different type and size of tears. Safety stress thresholds 
      were defined based on repaired tendon loads to failure reported in the literature 
      and used to discriminate safe from unsafe ranges-of-motion. FINDINGS: Increased 
      tear size and multiple tendons tear decreased safe range-of-motion. Mostly, 
      glenohumeral elevations below 38°, above 65°, or performed with the arm held in 
      internal rotation cause excessive stresses in most types and sizes of injury 
      during abduction, scaption or flexion. Larger safe amplitudes of elevation are 
      found in scapular plane for supraspinatus alone, supraspinatus plus 
      infraspinatus, and supraspinatus plus subscapularis tears. INTERPRETATION: This 
      study reinforces that passive early rehabilitation exercises could contribute to 
      re-tear due to excessive stresses. Recommendations arising from this study, for 
      instance to keep the arm externally rotated during elevation in case of 
      supraspinatus or supraspinatus plus infraspinatus tear, could help prevent 
      re-tear.

TI  - The acromiohumeral centre edge angle: A new radiographic measurement and its

AB  - BACKGROUND: Various radiographic measurements that describe humeral head coverage 
      by the acromion and the effect on rotator cuff pathology have been reported. This 
      study aimed to describe and validate a new radiographic measurement, the 
      acromiohumeral centre edge angle (ACEA). METHODS: We compared the ACEA on 
      computed tomography (CT) and plain X-ray to determine whether X-ray is accurate 
      for measuring this angle. We then compared the results from this control 
      population with 107 patients with acute rotator cuff tears. We compared 
      functional outcomes in rotator cuff tear patients to determine whether the ACEA 
      has any effect on outcome after surgery. An intra- and inter-observer variability 
      analysis was performed and we compared the ACEA to the acromial index (AI) on 
      rotation X-rays. RESULTS: The ACEA was comparable on CT and plain X-ray and was 
      most accurate when true anteroposterior glenohumeral X-rays were used (15.94° vs. 
      15.87° on CT, p = 0.476). The ACEA showed high intra- and inter-observer 
      reproducibility and was unchanged on internal and external rotation X-rays (20.48 
      vs. 20.47, p = 0.842), whereas the AI was significantly different (0.74 vs. 0.70, 
      p < 0.001). The ACEA was significantly higher in our rotator cuff tear patients 
      than the control population (23.9° vs. 16.6°, p < 0.001), although a higher ACEA 
      was not associated with poorer outcomes. CONCLUSION: The ACEA is a valid 
      measurement for describing humeral head coverage by the acromion and can be 
      accurately measured on plain radiographs with good reproducibility. It is 
      unaffected by shoulder rotation and was significantly higher in patients with 
      acute rotator cuff tears.

TI  - Recording scapular motion using an acromion marker cluster.
PG  - 123-8
LID - 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2008.07.012 [doi]
AB  - Disorders of the shoulder complex can be accompanied by changes in the movement 
      pattern of the scapula. However, scapular motion is difficult to measure. A 
      possible non-invasive method for dynamic three-dimensional kinematic measurement 
      of the human scapula is the use of a marker cluster placed on the flat part of 
      the acromion. A small light-weight acromion marker cluster (AMC) is presented in 
      this study. In order to assess validity, kinematics obtained with the AMC were 
      compared to simultaneous scapula locator (SL) recordings in a series of postures. 
      The test/retest variability of replacement of the AMC, was also assessed. 
      Measurement errors appeared to be sensitive for the plane of movement, the degree 
      of humerus elevation, and replacement of the AMC. The AMC generally 
      under-estimated scapula motion, compared to the SL. Some significant differences 
      were found between the two methods, although the absolute differences were small 
      (maximum mean difference 8.4 degrees in extreme position). In humerus forward 
      flexion and abduction the maximum mean differences were 6 degrees or lower. In 
      conclusion, the AMC is a valid method of measuring scapular movement during arm 
      elevation that could be used in shoulder pathologies. Placement and planes of 
      movement should be carefully considered and elevation of the humerus should not 
      exceed 100 degrees.

      and determination of anatomical parameters predictive of good functional outcome 
      in 21 shoulders].
PG  - 273-80
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the functional results of the Delta 3 inverted shoulder 
      prosthesis and determination of a radio-anatomical index predictive of best 
      functional outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 19 patients 
      (21 shoulders). Clinical (pain, satisfaction, amplitudes, Constant index) and 
      radiological (acromio-epiphyseal distance) evaluation at a mean follow up of 13.6 
      months. RESULTS: Outcomes concerning pain, quality of life and Constant index 
      were good and similar to other series. Few complications were observed. An 
      increase of the acromio-epiphyseal distance of 33 to 50% compared to the non 
      operated side is associated with a good functional result. CONCLUSION: Our 
      results confirm those of other series and show that Delta 3 inverted prosthesis 
      is an efficient therapeutic alternative in arthropathy with rotator cuff tears. 
      Rehabilitation is fairly short and easy. The increase of the acromio-epiphyseal 
      distance determines the tension of the deltoid muscle and could predict a 
      favorable outcome.

TI  - Arthroscopic resection of the acromioclavicular joint (ARAC).
PG  - 209-15
AB  - In 65 patients an arthroscopic resection of the AC-joint (ARAC) was performed. 
      The data of 27 male and 24 female patients with a minimum follow-up of 6 months 
      were available for analysis. 2 patients had bilateral procedures. Patients with 
      rotator cuff tears were excluded from this series. The patients were aged between 
      22 and 69 years (average 48.4 years). The mean interval from the onset of pain to 
      conservative treatment was 4.6 months and the average period of conservative 
      management prior to surgery was 9.8 months. The indication for ARAC was pain 
      which interfered with the patients' activities of daily living, work, or athletic 
      activities and had not responded to conservative therapy for at least 6 months. 
      Patients' data were recorded before and after surgery according to a 100-point 
      score as well as with a visual analogue scale. The patients' mean preoperative 
      score was 67.8 (+/- 14.6). After surgery, a significant improvement to 93.3 (+/- 
      12.3) was achieved. Comparing the different parameters we found significant 
      differences in pain during shoulder movement, function, and active range of 
      motion. Prior to surgery the other parameters already scored well, so they did 
      not serve as good discriminators for these patients. The mean reaction length of 
      the lateral clavicle was 23.2 mm inferiorly, 15.9 mm in the middle third, and 
      13.1 mm superiorly. No ectopic bone formation or postoperative spurs were 
      identified in this series. We could not demonstrate regeneration of the resected 
      parts of the lateral clavicle. No major complication was noted.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Development and evaluation of the measurement system for the human shoulder joint 
      based on the 6 DOF kinematic modelling.
PG  - 43-51
AB  - Although numerical models on the shoulder complex joint are currently available, 
      many are impractical because of the procedural complexity coupled with limited 
      and mere simple simulations. The present study defined the clavicle-scapula 
      system as the "base of the humerus" in determining the position of proximal head 
      of humerus, rendering conclusive innovation of a six degree of freedom (DOF) 
      shoulder complex joint model. Furthermore, a complete measurement system where 
      evaluation by calibrating the actual values via the use of an electromagnetic 
      tracking device (ETD) was developed based on the innovated model. The special 
      calibration method using optimizing calculation to work out the rotational center 
      of humerus was employed and actually tested if the theoretical consideration was 
      practically available. As a result of accuracy check experiments, the measurement 
      error was defined within 2-3 mm, indicating sufficient accuracy in studies for 
      human movement. Our findings strongly advocate that the benefit of this novel 
      measurement system would contribute to studies related to shoulder movements in 
      physiological anthropology.

TI  - Evaluation of clinical assessment methods for scapular dyskinesis.
PG  - 1240-8
LID - 10.1016/j.arthro.2009.06.007 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to (1) assess the inter-rater 
      reliability and validity of 2 clinical assessment methods of categorizing 
      scapular dyskinesis and (2) quantify the frequency of asymmetry of bilateral 
      scapular motion in injured and uninjured shoulders by use of 3-dimensional (3D) 
      kinematic analysis. METHODS: We evaluated 56 subjects, 35 with shoulder injury 
      and 21 with no symptoms. Two blinded evaluators categorized the scapular motion 
      of all subjects to determine inter-rater reliability using 2 observational 
      methods ("yes/no" and "4 type") to evaluate scapular dyskinesis. Subjects were 
      also instrumented with electromagnetic receivers to assess bilateral 3D scapular 
      kinematics to determine the presence of dyskinesis and establish criterion 
      validity of the 2 methods. RESULTS: The inter-rater percent agreement and the 
      degree of this agreement as measured by kappa statistic showed that the yes/no 
      method produced a higher inter-rater percent agreement (79%, kappa = 0.40) than 
      the 4-type method (61%, kappa = 0.44). The yes/no method had a higher sensitivity 
      (76%) and positive predictive value (74%) when compared with the 3D criterion. A 
      chi(2) analysis found significantly more multiple-plane asymmetries in 
      symptomatic subjects (54%) in flexion compared with asymptomatic subjects (14%) 
      (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: The yes/no method allows multiple-plane asymmetries to 
      be considered in clinical assessment and therefore renders this a good screening 
      tool for the presence of scapular dyskinesis. Kinematic analysis shows that 
      asymmetries are common in symptomatic and asymptomatic populations. Testing in 
      flexion showed a higher frequency of multiple-plane scapular asymmetries in the 
      symptomatic group. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Identification of scapular dyskinesis is a 
      key component of the shoulder examination. The clinician's ability to establish 
      the presence or absence of scapular dyskinesis by observation is enhanced using a 
      simple yes/no method especially when testing subjects in shoulder forward 
      flexion. Although scapular asymmetries appear to be a prevalent finding, 
      dyskinesis in the presence of shoulder symptoms should be considered a potential 
      factor contributing to the dysfunction in the presence of shoulder symptoms 
      should be considered a potential factor contributing to the dysfunction.

TI  - Stretching and strengthening exercises: their effect on three-dimensional 
      scapular kinematics.
PG  - 923-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively evaluate the effects of commonly used shoulder 
      exercises on shoulder kinematics and resting posture. STUDY DESIGN: A 
      repeated-measures design was used with measurements performed before and after a 
      6-week exercise program. METHOD: Twenty asymptomatic subjects with forward 
      shoulder posture were recruited. Stretching exercises for the pectoral muscles 
      and resisted strengthening exercises for the scapular retractors and elevators 
      and the glenohumeral abductors and external rotators were performed three times 
      per week for 6 weeks. A three-dimensional electromechanical digitizer was used to 
      measure thoracic inclination and scapular orientation and position. These 
      measurements were taken with the arm (1) at the side, (2) abducted to 90 degrees, 
      and (3) at maximal abduction. The isometric force of glenohumeral external and 
      internal rotation and horizontal abduction and adduction were measured with a 
      hand-held dynamometer. All subjects were tested before and after the 6-week 
      exercise program. Hotelling's T2 and paired t tests were used for data analysis. 
      RESULTS: The strength of horizontal abduction and internal and external rotation 
      increased after exercise (p < .01). The anterior inclination of the thoracic 
      spine decreased, and the glenohumeral contribution to arm elevation increased (p 
      < .01). Resting scapular posture did not change. As the arm was abducted to 90 
      degrees, the scapula showed less upward rotation and less superior translation 
      after the exercise program (p < .01). CONCLUSION: The exercise program improved 
      muscle strength, produced a more erect upper trunk posture, increased scapular 
      stability, and altered scapulohumeral rhythm.

TI  - Arthroscopic suprascapular nerve decompression at the suprascapular notch.
PG  - 1009-13
AB  - The suprascapular notch is a common location for entrapment of the suprascapular 
      nerve. Open surgical procedures for excision of the transverse scapular ligament 
      are associated with pain relief and functional improvement. Arthroscopic 
      procedures have been described for decompressing ganglion cysts, which compress 
      the nerve at the spinoglenoid notch. However, there is no description of an 
      arthroscopic procedure for decompression of the nerve at the suprascapular notch, 
      and this is probably related to unfamiliarity with the complex anatomy of the 
      region. The technique described herein is based on standard anatomic landmarks 
      and utilization of these as reference points for arthroscopic orientation and 
      reproducibility. The acromioclavicular joint, conoid ligament, and coracoid 
      process are stepwise reference landmarks leading to the suprascapular notch. 
      Arthroscopic identification of structures around the notch is necessary before 
      ligament resection. A new suprascapular portal, in combination with an accessory 
      portal, is described for retraction, blunt dissection, nerve stimulation, and 
      ligament resection. Key instruments include a 4-mm arthroscope of standard length 
      (160 mm), with a 70 degree angled lens for adequate visualization and a 
      calibrated probe to guide and limit dissection.

TI  - Scapular muscle recruitment pattern: electromyographic response of the trapezius 
      muscle to sudden shoulder movement before and after a fatiguing exercise.
PG  - 221-9
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Test-retest reliability study and single-group repeated measures 
      design. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the muscle latency times of the 3 portions of the 
      trapezius muscle to a sudden arm movement in normal shoulders and to determine if 
      this recruitment pattern is altered as a result of fatigue. BACKGROUND: It has 
      been suggested that shoulder impingement may be related to altered muscle 
      activity and muscle fatigue in the scapular stabilizers. Fatigue-induced changes 
      in latency times of the trapezius might influence scapular stability. METHODS AND 
      MEASURES: Muscle latency times were investigated in 30 healthy shoulders with 
      surface electromyography. Muscle activity was measured in all 3 sections of the 
      trapezius and the middle deltoid muscle during a sudden downward falling movement 
      of the arm. Subsequently the shoulder was fatigued on an isokinetic dynamometer, 
      after which muscle latency time measurement was repeated. RESULTS: ANOVA for 
      repeated measures revealed significant differences in latency times (P < 0.05) 
      among the 4 muscles of interest. Although there were no significant differences 
      among the 3 sections of the trapezius muscle, they all were recruited after the 
      initialization of the deltoid muscle. The recruitment order of the shoulder 
      muscles did not change with muscle fatigue. However, after fatigue, muscle 
      responses were significantly slower in all muscles except for the lower trapezius 
      (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There is a specific recruitment sequence in the shoulder 
      muscles in response to a sudden arm movement characterized by initial activation 
      of the middle deltoid muscle and followed by simultaneous contraction of all 3 
      sections of the trapezius. This muscle activation pattern is delayed but not 
      altered with fatigue.

TI  - A method of measuring three-dimensional scapular attitudes using the optotrak 
      probing system.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a method to obtain accurate three-dimensional scapular 
      attitudes and to assess their concurrent validity and reliability. STUDY DESIGN: 
      In this methodological study, the three-dimensional scapular attitudes were 
      calculated in degrees, using a rotation matrix (cyclic Cardanic sequence), from 
      spatial coordinates obtained with the probing of three non colinear landmarks 
      first on an anatomical model and second on a healthy subject. BACKGROUND: 
      Although abnormal movement of the scapula is related to shoulder impingement 
      syndrome, it is not clearly understood whether or not scapular motion impairment 
      is a predisposing factor. Characterization of three-dimensional scapular 
      attitudes in planes and at joint angles for which sub-acromial impingement is 
      more likely to occur is not known. METHODS: The Optotrak probing system was used. 
      An anatomical model of the scapula was built and allowed us to impose scapular 
      attitudes of known direction and magnitude. A local coordinate reference system 
      was defined with three non colinear anatomical landmarks to assess accuracy and 
      concurrent validity of the probing method with fixed markers. Axial rotation 
      angles were calculated from a rotation matrix using a cyclic Cardanic sequence of 
      rotations. The same three non colinear body landmarks were digitized on one 
      healthy subject and the three dimensional scapular attitudes obtained were 
      compared between sessions in order to assess the reliability. RESULTS AND 
      CONCLUSIONS: The measure of three dimensional scapular attitudes calculated from 
      data using the Optotrak probing system was accurate with means of the differences 
      between imposed and calculated rotation angles ranging from 1.5 degrees to 4.2 
      degrees. Greatest variations were observed around the third axis of the Cardanic 
      sequence associated with posterior-anterior transverse rotations. The mean 
      difference between the Optotrak probing system method and fixed markers was 1.73 
      degrees showing a good concurrent validity. Differences between the two methods 
      were generally very low for one and two direction displacements and the largest 
      discrepancies were observed for imposed displacements combining movement about 
      the three axes. The between sessions variation of three dimensional scapular 
      attitudes was less than 10% for most of the arm positions adopted by a healthy 
      subject suggesting a good reliability. The Optotrak probing system used with a 
      standardized protocol lead to accurate, valid and reliable measures of scapular 
      attitudes. RELEVANCE: Although abnormal range of motion of the scapula is often 
      related to shoulder pathologies, reliable outcome measures to quantify 
      three-dimensional scapular motion on subjects are not available. It is important 
      to establish a standardized protocol to characterize three-dimensional scapular 
      motion on subjects using a method for which the accuracy and validity are known. 
      The method used in the present study has provided such a protocol and will now 
      allow to verify to what extent, scapular motion impairment is linked to the 
      development of specific shoulder pathologies.

TI  - Electromyographic activity in the immobilized shoulder girdle musculature during 
      ipsilateral kinetic chain exercises.
PG  - 1377-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the electromyographic activity in the shoulder girdle 
      musculature during ipsilateral kinetic chain exercises performed in a shoulder 
      immobilizer in asymptomatic men. DESIGN: Descriptive. SETTING: Motion analysis 
      laboratory at a tertiary care center. PARTICIPANTS: Five asymptomatic male 
      volunteers, ages 24 to 32 years. INTERVENTION: Fine-wire (supraspinatus, 
      infraspinatus, upper subscapularis) and surface (deltoids, trapezii, biceps, 
      serratus anterior) electrodes recorded electromyographic activity from each 
      muscle during a split-stance cross-body rotation (twisting to the opposite side 
      at high, mid, and low levels), split stance attempted ipsilateral floor touch, 
      and attempted overhead reach. All movements were initiated from the immobilized 
      scapula and were tested with and without a combined step. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: 
      Mean peak normalized (percentage of maximum voluntary contraction [%MVC]) 
      electromyographic activity of each muscle during each exercise. RESULTS: For all 
      exercises, biceps and infraspinatus activity remained low (<10% MVC), whereas 
      upper subscapularis activity was moderate to very high (29%-68% MVC). 
      Supraspinatus activity was low (<20% MVC) for all motions except the attempted 
      overhead reach (23% MVC). Serratus electromyographic activity was less than 20% 
      of MVC for all motions and was most responsive to added stepping (23%-136% MVC 
      without stepping vs 24%-199% MVC with stepping). Cross-body rotation at lower 
      heights progressively increased serratus activity while decreasing supraspinatus, 
      upper trapezius, and anterior deltoid activity. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these 
      electromyographic data, selected kinetic chain exercises could potentially be 
      implemented during periods of shoulder immobilization. All exercises examined 
      could potentially be safe after superior labral anteroposterior repair, but not 
      after subscapularis repair. All exercises, with the exception of the attempted 
      overhead reach, could potentially be safe after supraspinatus repair, with or 
      without concomitant infraspinatus repair. Early activation of the serratus 
      anterior could potentially be achieved by performing cross-body rotations, 
      particularly at lower heights.

TI  - Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty without Bone-Grafting for Severe Glenoid Bone 
      Loss in Patients with Osteoarthritis and Intact Rotator Cuff.
PG  - 1801-1807
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treating shoulders with osteoarthritis, an intact rotator cuff, and 
      substantial glenoid bone loss is challenging. One option is reaming the glenoid 
      flat and inserting a reverse prosthesis. This study reports the subjective, 
      objective, and radiographic results of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) 
      in this population. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 42 consecutive patients 
      (23 women; mean age, 71 years [range, 53 to 89 years]) with primary glenohumeral 
      osteoarthritis, intact rotator cuffs, and Walch type-A2 (n = 19), B2 (n = 5), or 
      C glenoids (n = 18) who had undergone a total of 42 RTSAs with glenoid reaming 
      without bone-grafting between 2008 and 2013 (mean follow-up, 36 months [range, 24 
      to 66 months]). All patients were evaluated before and after surgery subjectively 
      (using a visual analog scale for pain and 5 shoulder-specific outcome 
      instruments), objectively (with goniometric examination of shoulder range of 
      motion), and radiographically (to assess baseplate loosening and degree of 
      scapular notching). RESULTS: One baseplate (2%) failed, requiring revision 
      surgery. There were no other signs of baseplate loosening in any patient at the 
      last follow-up. Preoperatively to postoperatively, pain improved significantly (p 
      < 0.001), as did all patient-reported outcome measures and the following 
      range-of-motion parameters (p ≤ 0.001): active abduction, active flexion, and 
      active external rotation with the arm elevated 90°. Eight (19%) of the patients 
      had notching. CONCLUSIONS: RTSA without bone-grafting and with medialization of 
      the baseplate in patients with osteoarthritis and severe glenoid bone loss 
      resulted in significant improvement in pain and function with reliable short-term 
      implant survivorship and may be a good alternative to anatomical TSA. Longer 
      follow-up is needed to determine the relative advantages and disadvantages. This 
      was an "off-label" indication for this device. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic 
      Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of 
      evidence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of 2 clinicians to reliably measure the 
      thickness of the serratus anterior (SA) muscle using ultrasound during scapular 
      protraction and to determine whether that thickness changes during activation of 
      the SA. DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: An outpatient 
      biomechanical laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty healthy, asymptomatic adults 
      between the ages of 23 and 28 years. METHODS: Ultrasound imaging measurements 
      were recorded during 3 conditions: (1) with the subject in a side-lying position 
      and resting in a supported position of 90° of shoulder flexion; (2) with the 
      subject in a side-lying position and the shoulder in 90° of shoulder flexion and 
      actively protracting; and (3) with the subject in a side-lying position and the 
      shoulder in 90° of shoulder flexion while holding the protracted position against 
      15 lb of force. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Reproducibility was examined with use 
      of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standard error of measurements. 
      The thickness of the SA muscle measured during each condition was compared. 
      RESULTS: Intratester and intertester ICC values were high. Ranges for ICCs were 
      0.892-0.979 for intratester reliability within a session, 0.900-0.912 for 
      intratester reliability between sessions, and 0.929-0.939 for intertester 
      reliability. Statistically significant differences in the thickness of the SA 
      were found between the rest condition and the hold with resistance condition but 
      not between the rest condition and the active hold condition. CONCLUSION: 
      Findings of this study document the high reliability of ultrasound imaging in 
      determining SA muscle thickness and thickness changes at rest and during 
      contraction of the SA. Clinicians should be aware that resistance may need to be 
      added to active scapular protraction in a side-lying position to produce a 
      significant change in SA thickness from the rest position. This information can 
      be used by clinicians who assess the SA and treat scapular dysfunction when 
      activation or facilitation of the SA is required.

TI  - Analyzing glenohumeral torque-rotation response in vivo.
PG  - 759-64
LID - 10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2010.06.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because the human shoulder has many degrees of freedom that allow 
      redundant means of producing the same net humerothoracic motion, there are many 
      impediments to objective, repeatable assessment of shoulder function in vivo. 
      Devices designed to date have suffered from poor reliability. In this study we 
      introduce a new device and methods to evaluate human shoulder kinematics and 
      evaluate its reproducibility from subject to subject and from day to day. 
      METHODS: This was a controlled laboratory study. Using electromagnetic motion 
      sensors to record the position and orientation of the thorax, scapula, and 
      humerus, we quantified the kinematic response of twenty four normal shoulders in 
      response to known internal-external torque application. A four-parameter logistic 
      function was selected to characterize the strident features of the 
      torque-rotation relationship. FINDINGS: Our analysis in conjunction with the 
      measurement technique described herein, allowed the passive glenohumeral 
      internal-external range of motion to be differentiated from other motion 
      components and was determined to within 9.6% of full scale over three repeated 
      trials. Range of motion was the most reliable biomechanical outcome, more so than 
      computed indices of glenohumeral flexibility and hysteresis. The exact profile of 
      the torque-rotation response, and therefore the repeatability of the calculated 
      outcomes, was unique from shoulder to shoulder. INTERPRETATION: The development 
      of the capacity for precise, non-invasive measurement of shoulder biomechanics 
      over time is a requisite step towards optimizing treatment of shoulder injury and 
      disease. Our current methods are superior to previous attempts at trying to 
      non-invasively evaluate the biomechanics of the glenohumeral joint.

TI  - Fixation of winged scapula in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 155-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To verify if stabilizing the scapulothoracic joint without arthrodesis 
      could lead to functional improvement of shoulder range of motion and clinical 
      improvement of winged scapula, we incorporated four additional patients into our 
      previous analysis to determine if the results obtained were long lasting, and to 
      compare this fixation with the other techniques described in the literature, 
      balancing the benefits with the complications. DESIGN: A retrospective study. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen patients with bilateral winged scapula affected by 
      facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Nine of these patients had been analyzed 
      in our previous study. METHODS: Patients were operated on by bilateral fixing of 
      the scapula to the rib cage using metal wires without arthrodesis (scapulopexy). 
      RESULTS: All patients experienced improvement in active range of motion of the 
      shoulder and all of them had clinical improvement with complete resolution of the 
      winged scapula. In all twenty-six surgical interventions of scapulopexy, a stable 
      and long-lasting fixation of the scapula to the rib cage was achieved. The 
      complications strictly associated to the surgical technique encountered were one 
      pneumothorax, which was resolved spontaneously, and one wire breakage without 
      trauma. Average follow-up was 10 years (range, 3 to 18 years). CONCLUSION: The 
      scapulopexy used in this extended series of patients consisted of repositioning 
      the scapula and fixing it to four ribs by using metal wires without performing 
      arthrodesis. This technique has a low rate of complications, is reproducible, 
      safe and effective, resulting in clinical and functional improvement.

TI  - In vitro biomechanical analysis of glenoïds before and after implantation of 
      prosthetic components.
PG  - 1071-80
AB  - Biomechanical investigations are yet necessary to better understand the origin of 
      the glenoïd loosening which is the main reason for revision surgery. The aim of 
      this study was to analyse the behaviour of cadaveric glenoïds before and after 
      implantation of glenoïd prostheses. For that, we developed a new experimental 
      protocol allowing measurement of bone strains and implants displacements under 
      various loading cases. Ten pairs of fresh cadaveric scapulae were tested. Two 
      kinds of loads were applied on the intact glenoïd: physiological loads 
      corresponding to a 0-180 degrees abduction and anteflexion movements, and 500N 
      loads. The glenoïds were then implanted with a keeled or pegged cemented 
      polyethylene implant. The same previous 500N loads were then applied on the 
      implanted glenoïds. Strains were measured using six strain gages placed on 
      precise points around the peripheral cortex of the glenoïd. Displacements of 
      implants under loading were measured using two CCD cameras. Maximum strains were 
      obtained between 60 degrees and 120 degrees of abduction or anteflexion. They 
      were located at the anterior and antero-superior parts of the glenoïd during 
      abduction and at the posterior and postero-superior parts during anteflexion. 
      Implantation of a prosthetic component generally seemed to increase strains, but 
      tensile strains were decreased at the postero-inferior part with the 
      antero-inferior loading point.Some differences were observed between the 
      implants, but they have to be confirmed by further experiments. The great number 
      of data obtained for intact scapulae could be used for a better understanding of 
      glenoïd behaviour and for validation of finite element models.

TI  - Soft tissue structures resisting anterior instability in a computational 
      glenohumeral joint model.
PG  - 781-9
LID - 10.1080/10255842.2011.641120 [doi]
AB  - The glenohumeral joint is the most dislocated joint in the body due to the lack 
      of bony constraints and the dependence on soft tissue for stability. The roles 
      that various structures provide to joint function are important for understanding 
      injury treatment and orthopaedic device design purposes. The goal of this study 
      was to develop a computational model of the glenohumeral joint whereby joint 
      behaviour was dictated by articular contact, ligamentous constraints, muscle 
      loading and external perturbations. The bone structure of the computational model 
      consisted of assembled computer tomographic images of the scapula, humerus and 
      clavicle. The soft tissue elements were composed of forces and tension-only 
      springs that represented muscles and ligaments. Validation of this model was 
      achieved by comparing computational predictions to the results of a cadaveric 
      experiment in which the relative contribution of muscles and ligaments to 
      anterior joint stability was examined. The computational model predicted an 
      anterior subluxation force that was similar to the cadaveric experimental results 
      in humeral external rotation. The individual structure results showed the 
      subscapularis to be critical to stabilisation in both neutral and external 
      rotations, the biceps stabilised the joint in neutral but not in external 
      rotation, and the inferior glenohumeral ligament resisted anterior displacement 
      only in external rotation. The model's predictions were similar to the 
      conclusions of the cadaveric experiment and the literature. Knowledge gained from 
      this type of model could assist in further understanding the contribution of soft 
      tissue stabilisers to joint function, pre-operative planning or the design of 
      orthopaedic implants.

TI  - Establishing normative data on scapulothoracic musculature using handheld 
      dynamometry.
PG  - 502-20
AB  - CONTEXT: Scapular strength deficits have been linked to shoulder dysfunction. 
      OBJECTIVE: To establish normative data on the scapulothoracic musculature in 
      normal subjects using a handheld dynamometer. DESIGN: Descriptive normative data 
      study. SETTING: Field research. SUBJECTS: 172 subjects with varying levels of 
      overhead activity. METHODS: A handheld dynamometer was used to test the upper, 
      middle, and lower trapezius; rhomboids; and serratus anterior. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: A 2-factor ANOVA was performed for each of the muscles by activity 
      level and unilateral ratio by activity-level analyses. Post hoc analysis included 
      multiple pairwise comparisons, using the Dunn-Bonferroni correction method. 
      RESULTS: Activity level did not significantly affect the unilateral ratios: 
      Elevation:depression was 2.5:1, upward:downward rotation was 1.5:1, and 
      protraction:retraction was 1.25:1. A rank order from strongest to weakest was 
      established through significant comparisons. CONCLUSION: The unilateral ratios 
      along with the rank order should be considered when discussing scapular 
      rehabilitation protocols.

TI  - Suprascapular nerve block disrupts the normal pattern of scapular kinematics.
PG  - 545-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with full thickness rotator cuff tears typically demonstrate 
      an increase in scapular motion, both in the clinic and under controlled 
      laboratory conditions. To better understand the mechanisms behind this pattern of 
      motion, we propose a suprascapular nerve block as an appropriate model of 
      dysfunction of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus, which are the two tendons 
      most commonly affected in cuff tear patients. METHODS: Healthy subjects underwent 
      testing for 3D scapular kinematics with a Polhemus magnetic tracking device and 
      isometric force measurements during external rotation. A suprascapular nerve 
      block was then performed with the injection of lidocaine into the suprascapular 
      notch of each subject. Scapular kinematics and isometric force measurements were 
      repeated after confirmation of the block. FINDINGS: The nerve block resulted in 
      no significant changes in clavicular rotations and scapular posterior tilting. 
      However, there was a significant increase in scapular external rotation and 
      upward rotation. While kinematic changes returned to baseline within 25 min of 
      the block, force measurements did not return to baseline until 75 min post-block. 
      Interpretation. The results of this study, especially those for upward rotation, 
      are in general agreement with what has been found for patients with rotator cuff 
      tears. While the supraspinatus and infraspinatus do not directly control the 
      movement of the scapula, they appear to result in a compensatory change in 
      scapular motion. Although more work needs to be done, it appears that abnormal 
      scapular motion patterns observed in patients with cuff tears may therefore be 
      compensatory in nature.

TI  - Laser morphometric analysis of the glenoid fossa of the scapula.
PG  - 320-3
AB  - We have assessed the topography of the articular surface of the glenoid fossa 
      using a laser morphometric technique. Eighteen cadaveric scapulae from 
      individuals aged 66 to 90 years were scanned and the degree of version of five 
      lines constructed in the horizontal plane was determined. The lines comprised a 
      transverse reference line (equatorial midline) located midway between the 
      superior and inferior tubercles of the fossa, lines at 45% of the height of the 
      glenoid fossa above and below the equatorial line, and further lines midway 
      between these pairs. The cartilage-covered glenoid articular surface displayed 
      differences in version between its superior and inferior aspects; the mean 
      difference in version between the superior and inferior lines was 11.2 degrees, 
      with the most superior line being retroverted 8.2 degrees with respect to the 
      equatorial midline and the most inferior line anteverted 3.2 degrees. These data 
      may be of importance in understanding the kinematics of the glenohumeral joint 
      and in translating this knowledge to joint replacement surgery.

TI  - [Clinical study on the treatment of acromioclavicular joint dislocation of tossy 
      grade III with double endobutton].
PG  - 653-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effects of internal fixation with double 
      endobutton for the treatment of acromioclavicular joint dislocation of Tossy 
      Grade III. METHODS: From 2007.7 to 2008.12, 27 patients with acromioclavicular 
      joint dislocation of Tossy Grade III were fixed with double endobutton. Among the 
      patients, 17 patients were male and 10 patients were female, with an average age 
      of (35.0 +/- 1.3) years (ranged from 23 to 60 years). Fourteen patients were 
      injured by traffic accident, 6 patients were work-related injuries, 4 patients 
      were sports injuries, and 3 patients were injured by falling down. Sixteen 
      patients had injuries in the left, and 11 patients in the right. All the patients 
      were Tossy III type dislocation without clavicle fracture. The therapeutic 
      effects were evaluated by Karlsson criteria based on range of motion of 
      acromioclavicular joint, pain, muscle force and postreduction X-ray. RESULTS: All 
      the patients were followed up for 6 to 14 months, mean 10.2 months. According to 
      the Karlsson score criteria, 24 patients obtained an excellent result, 2 fair and 
      1 poor. CONCLUSION: Fixation with double endobutton is to be a new method for the 
      treatment of acromioclavicular joint dislocation, which has the advantages of 
      minimal trauma, reliable fixation, early functional rehabilitation and so on.

TI  - Os acromiale: evaluation and treatment.
PG  - 277-83
AB  - Os acromiale is a developmental aberration in which the distal acromion fails to 
      fuse. This aberration is often discovered incidentally but may present with a 
      clinical picture similar to that of subacromial impingement syndrome. Treatment 
      for symptomatic os acromiale is initially nonoperative-activity modification, 
      physical therapy, corticosteroid injection, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
      medication. Nonoperative management of clinically significant, radiographically 
      confirmed os acromiale should be pursued for at least 6 months before 
      consideration of surgical intervention. Subacromial decompression is often 
      necessary to address symptoms of impingement. Excision of the os fragment may 
      provide definitive treatment for smaller fragments (<3 cm). Removal of larger 
      fragments remains controversial and should be approached with caution. Surgical 
      fixation of larger fragments with or without supplemental autograft in 
      conjunction with a structured postoperative program of physical therapy can 
      reliably provide relief for symptomatic os acromiale.

TI  - Contralateral motor rootlets and ipsilateral nerve transfers in brachial plexus 
      reconstruction.
PG  - 770-8
AB  - OBJECT: The goal of this study was to evaluate outcomes in patients with brachial 
      plexus avulsion injuries who underwent contralateral motor rootlet and 
      ipsilateral nerve transfers to reconstruct shoulder abduction/external rotation 
      and elbow flexion. METHODS: Within 6 months after the injury, 24 patients with a 
      mean age of 21 years underwent surgery in which the contralateral C-7 motor 
      rootlet was transferred to the suprascapular nerve by using sural nerve grafts. 
      The biceps motor branch or the musculocutaneous nerve was repaired either by an 
      ulnar nerve fascicular transfer or by transfer of the 11th cranial nerve or the 
      phrenic nerve. The mean recovery in abduction was 90 degrees and 92 degrees in 
      external rotation. In cases of total palsy, only two patients recovered external 
      rotation and in those cases mean external rotation was 70 degrees. Elbow flexion 
      was achieved in all cases. In cases of ulnar nerve transfer, the muscle scores 
      were M5 in one patient, M4 in six patients, and M3+ in five patients. Elbow 
      flexion repair involving the use of the 11th cranial nerve resulted in a score of 
      M3+ in five patients and M4 in two patients. After surgery involving the phrenic 
      nerve, two patients received a score of M3 + and two a score of M4. Results were 
      clearly better in patients with partial lesions and in those who were shorter 
      than 170 cm (p < 0.01). The length of the graft used in motor rootlet transfers 
      affected only the recovery of external rotation. There was no permanent injury at 
      the donor sites. CONCLUSIONS: Motor rootlet transfer represents a reliable and 
      potent neurotizer that allows the reconstruction of abduction and external 
      rotation in partial injuries.

TI  - Multidirectional kinematics of the glenohumeral joint during simulated simple 
      translation tests: impact on clinical diagnoses.
PG  - 889-94
AB  - At the end ranges of motion, the glenohumeral capsule limits translation of the 
      humeral head in multiple directions. Since the 6-degree of freedom kinematics of 
      clinical tests are commonly utilized to diagnose shoulder injuries, the objective 
      of this study was to determine the magnitude and repeatability of glenohumeral 
      joint kinematics during a simulated simple anteroposterior translation test in 
      the anterior and posterior directions. A magnetic tracking system was used to 
      determine the kinematics of the humerus with respect to the scapula in eight 
      cadaveric shoulders. At 60 degrees of glenohumeral abduction and 0 degrees of 
      flexion/extension, a clinician applied anterior and posterior loads to the 
      humerus at 0 degrees, 30 degrees, and 60 degrees of external rotation until a 
      manual maximum (simulating a simple translation test) was achieved. Prior to each 
      test, the reference position of the humerus shifted posteriorly 1.8+/-2.0 and 
      4.1+/-3.8 mm at 30 degrees and 60 degrees of external rotation, respectively. 
      Anterior translation decreased significantly (p < 0.05) from 18.2+/-5.3 mm at 0 
      degrees of external rotation to 15.5+/-5.1 and 9.9+/-5.5 mm at 30 degrees and 60 
      degrees, respectively. However, no significant differences were detected between 
      the posterior translations of 13.4+/-6.4, 17.1+/-5.0, and 15.8+/-6.0 mm at 0 
      degrees, 30 degrees, and 60 degrees of external rotation, respectively. Coupled 
      translations (perpendicular to the direction of loading) at 0 degrees (6.1+/-4.0 
      and 3.8+/-2.9 mm), 30 degrees (4.7+/-2.7 and 5.9+/-3.1 mm), and 60 degrees 
      (2.3+/-2.3 and 5.0+/-3.5 mm) of external rotation were in the inferior direction 
      in both the anterior and posterior directions, respectively. Based on the data 
      obtained, performing a simulated simple translation test should result in coupled 
      inferior translations and anterior translations that are a function of external 
      rotation. The low standard deviations demonstrate that the observed translations 
      should be repeatable. Furthermore, capsular stretching or injury to the 
      anterior-inferior region of the capsule should be detectable during clinical 
      examination if excessive coupled translations exist or no posterior shift of the 
      reference position with external rotation is noted.

TI  - Extra-articular knowles pin fixation for unstable distal clavicle fractures.
PG  - 1522-7
LID - 10.1097/TA.0b013e3180593646 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unstable distal clavicle fractures may benefit from surgical 
      treatment. This report described a new method with transacromial extra-articular 
      Knowles pin fixation to treat these unstable fractures. The hypothesis is that 
      the results would be improved. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with unstable distal 
      clavicle fractures were treated by transacromial extra-articular Knowles pin 
      fixation, coracoclavicular ligament repair and augmentation. The mean clinical 
      and radiographic follow-up was 51 months. Functional outcomes were evaluated by a 
      modified Constant-Murley score. RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of patients had 
      uneventful fracture union. Eight percent had delayed or nonunion with pin 
      loosening. Both had successful union after revision surgery. The injured 
      shoulders functioned similar to the uninjured shoulders. CONCLUSION: The 
      transacromial extra- articular Knowles pin fixation method is a reliable method 
      to treat the unstable distal clavicle fractures with an acceptable complication 
      rate.

TI  - Shoulder impingement in front-crawl swimming: I. A method to identify 
      impingement.
PG  - 21-9
AB  - PURPOSE: The impingement of subacromial structures has been proposed as a major 
      cause of the shoulder problems experienced by athletes who use repetitive 
      overhead actions. The purpose of this study was to develop a noninvasive method 
      to identify instances at which the shoulder was experiencing impingement during 
      front-crawl swimming. METHODS: Shoulder impingement has been reported to occur 
      when an arm is: (a) elevated above shoulder height while being rotated 
      internally; and (b) forcibly elevated at, or beyond, the maximum active elevation 
      angle. In this study shoulder configurations that satisfied the above two 
      conditions were sought throughout the functional range of each shoulder; and a 
      boundary that distinguished configurations that would cause shoulder impingement 
      was defined. The shoulder movements exhibited during performance of the 
      front-crawl stroke were measured using three-dimensional videography and compared 
      with the boundary defined for each shoulder. The shoulder was considered to 
      experience impingement if the shoulder configuration observed exceeded the 
      boundary defined for that shoulder. RESULTS: For a male collegiate swimmer, 
      impingement occurred for 12% of the stroke time for each shoulder. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The analysis permitted the identification of the instances at which the shoulders 
      were experiencing impingement during the front-crawl swimming. In this study, the 
      measurement of the boundary was based entirely upon the mechanism of impingement 
      described in the literature. Further studies are needed to confirm the occurrence 
      of impingement by means of advanced visualization techniques, such as magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonogram.

TI  - Glenohumeral joint kinematics related to minor anterior instability of the 
      shoulder at the end of the late preparatory phase of throwing.
PG  - 752-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study was an approach to quantify the 3D 
      kinematics of the glenohumeral joint referred to the joint surfaces. The method 
      was used to study the glenohumeral patho-arthrokinematics related to minor 
      anterior instability at the end of the late preparatory phase of throwing. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Using a finite helical axis approach, arthrokinematics focused on: (i) 
      the rotations and shift of the humeral head on the glenoid cavity, and (ii) the 
      migration of contact of the articular surfaces. BACKGROUND: Controversy still 
      exists whether the clinical syndrome called 'minor anterior glenohumeral 
      instability' can be validly termed as an instability. METHODS: Helical CT-data of 
      discrete shoulder positions were three-dimensionally reconstructed. Based on 
      humeral and scapular sets of skeletal landmarks, rotation matrices and 
      translation vectors were estimated and processed in glenohumeral finite helical 
      axes. The finite helical axis parameters of rotation, shift and direction were 
      related to a co-ordinate system embedded on the glenoid, whereas the position of 
      the finite helical axis was related to the articulating surface of the humeral 
      head. RESULTS: From 90 degrees abduction and 90 degrees external rotation to full 
      cocking (90 degrees abduction with full external rotation and horizontal 
      extension), the humeral head in the normal shoulders did not 
      externally/internally rotate on the glenoid. In contrast, a large external 
      rotation component was found in the minor unstable shoulders. The geometrical 
      centre of the humeral head of the normal shoulders translated into a 
      posteriorized position on the glenoid, whereas in minor anterior instability it 
      translated centrally on the glenoid. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with in vitro 
      biomechanical research which states that towards full cocking the anterior part 
      of the inferior glenohumeral ligament limits anterior translation and external 
      rotation of the humeral head on the glenoid, the results suggest in minor 
      anterior instability a dysfunction of the anterior part of the inferior 
      glenohumeral ligament. RELEVANCE: The results indicate that the so-called 'minor 
      anterior glenohumeral instability syndrome' can validly be stated as an 
      instability problem. The results also indicate that the glenohumeral joint does 
      not move consistently as a ball-and-socket joint, meaning that the concave-convex 
      rules for glenohumeral joint mobilization need 'evidence-based' adjustments.

TI  - Three-dimensional clavicular motion during arm elevation: reliability and 
      descriptive data.
PG  - 140-9
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. OBJECTIVES: To determine the reliability of a 
      surface sensor measurement of clavicular motion during arm elevation and to 
      describe 3-dimensional clavicular motion in an asymptomatic population. 
      BACKGROUND: Abnormal scapular motion on the thorax has been implicated in 
      shoulder pathology. Without the ability to measure clavicular motion, it is not 
      possible to identify if abnormal scapular motions derive from the 
      sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. METHODS AND MEASURES: Thirty-nine 
      subjects participated in the investigation, including an asymptomatic group (n = 
      30) and a group with a history or current symptoms of shoulder pathology (n = 9). 
      Clavicular angles relative to the thorax were tracked with surface 
      electromagnetic sensors on the thorax, clavicle, and humerus as subjects 
      completed humeral flexion, scapular plane abduction, and abduction. Within-day 
      reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients and SEM. 
      Descriptive statistics quantified sternoclavicular joint motions for the various 
      arm movements. RESULTS: Reliable measurements were obtained, with intraclass 
      correlation coefficients ranging from 0.93 to 0.99, and SEMs from 0.9 degrees to 
      1.8 degrees. Between-day reliability SEM values were generally 2 degrees to 4 
      degrees. During elevation of the arm, the clavicle with respect to the thorax 
      generally undergoes elevation (11 degrees-15 degrees maximum), retraction (15 
      degrees-29 degrees maximum), and posterior long-axis rotation (15 degrees-31 
      degrees maximum), with variability between subjects and planes of motion 
      regarding the magnitude of motion. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation approaches 
      attempting to improve shoulder motion should benefit from improved knowledge of 
      3-dimensional contributions of the clavicle to normal and abnormal scapular 
      kinematics.

TI  - Scapulohumeral rhythm and associated spinal motion.
PG  - 184-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the coordination of humeral, scapular and 
      thoracolumbar spine motions during a number of unilateral and bilateral upper 
      limb movements in a range of movement conditions. METHODS: Thirty-two healthy 
      women performed unilateral and bilateral arm elevations in three planes-sagittal, 
      coronal and scapular. Scapular, humeral and spinal orientations were measured at 
      100 Hz using a multi-sensor, 6-degree-of-freedom electromagnetic tracking system. 
      Segmental displacements were computed following International Society of 
      Biomechanics recommendations. FINDINGS: Humeral, scapular and thoracic segments 
      demonstrate consistent, synchronous interactions. Scapular upward rotation is 
      significantly greater on the non-dominant side than the dominant in all planes of 
      movement and in both unilateral and bilateral arm movement. Unilateral and 
      bilateral arm movements produce significantly different ranges and patterns of 
      spinal motion and ranges of scapular external rotation. There does not appear to 
      be any effect of age, height or weight on the ranges or patterns of motion of the 
      shoulder girdle and spine during arm elevation. INTERPRETATION: Movement of the 
      arm into elevation, irrespective of the plane of motion, has significant 
      implications for the shoulder girdle and the thoracic spine. Clinical assessment 
      of the shoulder should include the thoracic spine.

TI  - Posture in patients with shoulder overuse injuries and healthy individuals.
PG  - 287-95
AB  - Assessment of posture is an integral component of patient evaluation with 
      shoulder overuse injuries. However, the professional literature contains 
      relatively few studies that have assessed the relationship between posture, 
      function, and injury. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship 
      and differences in postural variables within and between subjects with overuse 
      injuries to the shoulder of healthy subjects. Thirty patient subjects and 30 
      healthy subjects matched for age and gender were recruited. Scapular protraction 
      and rotation, forward head position, midthoracic curvature, and passive humeral 
      elevation in the plane of the scapula were measured randomly in standing. All 
      measurement techniques were standardized and validated. Intrarater and interrater 
      reliability for all clinical measures were established before data collection. 
      Forward head position was significantly greater (p < .001) in the patient group 
      than the healthy group; humeral elevation was significantly greater (p < .001) in 
      the healthy group than in the patient group and in the uninvolved shoulders (p < 
      .01) than the involved shoulders within the patient group. Scapular protraction, 
      rotation, midthoracic curvature, and scapular symmetry were not significantly 
      different between groups. Scapula protraction and rotation were significantly 
      related (p < .05) in the patient group. No other postural variables were related. 
      Conclusions regarding the influence of posture to shoulder injury are 
      inconclusive based on several confounding variables that may have affected the 
      outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of glenohumeral osteoarthritis in young patients is 
      challenging. Total shoulder arthroplasty reliably addresses pain and dysfunction 
      but compromises glenoid bone stock. Various efforts have been made to avoid a 
      prosthetic glenoid component or to prevent glenoid erosion after 
      hemiarthroplasty. Capsular interposition, meniscal allograft, and more recently, 
      GraftJacket (Wright Medical Technology Inc, Arlington, TN, USA), a human dermal 
      collagen allograft, have been proposed for interposition arthroplasty in young 
      patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis. METHODS: From 2009 to 2010, 
      GraftJacket was used for glenoid resurfacing combined with humeral resurfacing or 
      a stemmed hemiarthroplasty in 6 patients with a mean age of 47 years (34-57 
      years). Before GraftJacket was available, 5 patients were treated with a meniscal 
      allograft and 6 with capsular interposition arthroplasty. RESULTS: At a mean of 
      16 months (9-22 months) after the GraftJacket was implanted, 5 of the 6 patients 
      were revised to a total shoulder arthroplasty or a reverse total shoulder 
      arthroplasty. The sixth patient was dissatisfied but declined further surgery. 
      The mean relative, preoperative Constant score decreased from 35% (range, 
      13%-61%) to 31% (range, 15%-43%) at revision or latest follow-up. Of the 5 
      patients with meniscal allograft, 3 underwent revision at a mean of 22 months 
      (range, 12-40 months), and 4 of the 6 patients with capsular interposition were 
      revised at a mean of 34 months (range, 23-45 months). The mean relative Constant 
      scores preoperatively and at revision or latest follow-up were 44% (range, 
      19%-68%) and 58% (range, 9%-96%) for the meniscal allograft patients and 47% 
      (range, 38%-62%) and 63% (range, 32%-92%) for the capsular interposition cases. 
      CONCLUSION: In our hands, 3 different types of biological resurfacings combined 
      with humeral hemiarthroplasty have an unacceptable early failure rate.

AB  - Shoulder dislocation is an injury with potential long-term consequences that 
      requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Patient positioning and imperfect 
      radiographic views may result in discomfort, added examination time, and 
      problematic diagnosis. The scapular Y radiograph has been shown to be useful in 
      diagnosing shoulder dislocation but is not considered sufficient in isolation. 
      Using a synthetic bone shoulder model, we propose a novel technique wherein 
      osseous landmarks are used to form angles that significantly improved diagnostic 
      accuracy for shoulder dislocation, even in significantly rotated and otherwise 
      indeterminate scapular Y radiographs.

TI  - Perthes lesion (a variant of the Bankart lesion): MR imaging and MR arthrographic 
      findings with surgical correlation.
PG  - 233-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of MR imaging in the 
      characterization of the Perthes lesion by correlating MR findings with findings 
      at arthroscopy. CONCLUSION: The use of a combination of axial and 
      abduction-external rotation position sequences on MR images can be helpful in the 
      diagnosis of a Perthes lesion. A fluid-filled joint with capsular distension, 
      caused by either a large amount of effusion or MR arthrography, was found to be 
      helpful in outlining Perthes lesions. Adding the abduction-external rotation 
      position to the protocol in patients in whom Perthes lesion is suspected will 
      increase diagnostic accuracy and may reveal a Perthes lesion not visible on axial 
      images, as was the case in 50% of the patients in our series.

TI  - [Dynamic radiographic evaluation of the antero-inferior gleno-humeral ligament].
PG  - 201-9
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this work was to propose an objective 
      radiographic evaluation of the antero-inferior gleno-humeral ligament for 
      comparison with the clinical assessment proposed by Gagey. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      A test radiogram was obtained from 32 healthy volunteers (15 men, 17 women, mean 
      age, 29 years, age range 21-54 years) free of shoulder disease. The dynamic test 
      image consisted in a strictly AP view of the shoulder in forced abduction in 
      neutral rotation. The subjects were awake and in dorsal decubitus. Displacements 
      of the scapulo-thoracic articulation were limited by a counter-force applied to 
      the acromion, in accordance with the method described by Gagey. Bilateral images 
      were obtained for comparison. Several angles were measured between the humeral 
      shaft and the scapula to search for the most reliable and reproducible 
      measurement. RESULTS: Three series of angles were measured between the axis of 
      the humeral shaft and the scapula. The mean angle between the axis of the humeral 
      shaft and line drawn from the lower rim of the glenoid cavity to the lateral 
      border of the scapular tubercle was 130.3 degrees (range 110-148 degrees) on the 
      dominant side and 131.5 degrees (108-148 degrees) on the non-dominant side; 
      giving 38 degrees variability on the dominant side and 40 degrees variation on 
      the non-dominant side and a standard deviation of 10.4 degrees on the dominant 
      side and 11.5 degrees on the non-dominant side. The mean difference in 
      gleno-humeral abduction was 3.8 degrees (range 0-14 degrees) between the dominant 
      and non-dominant side. DISCUSSION: Among the different angles measured between 
      the scapula and the humerus, the angle between the axis of the humeral shaft and 
      the line drawn from the lower rim of the glenoid cavity to the lateral border of 
      the scapular tubercle was the most reliable and reproducible. Inter-observer 
      measurements were well correlated. We observed that the variability in the 
      radiographic values of the scapulo-humeral angle was much greater than the 
      clinical values described by Gagey who, finding very constant values during 
      forced abduction, described "invariable" scapulo-humeral abduction of the 
      shoulder. Our study demonstrates that scapulo-humeral abduction is not an 
      invariable parameter. More interestingly, the difference in amplitude between the 
      dominant and non-dominant sides showed very strong interindividual correlation. 
      Interobserver variability was low and reproducibility was good. CONCLUSION: This 
      dynamic radiographic test enables a precise quantified assessment of pure 
      gleno-humeral abduction which depends on the antero-inferior gleno-humeral 
      ligament. This test is reliable and reproducible. Variations in the length of the 
      antero-inferior gleno-humeral ligament evaluated radiographically were greater 
      than described clinically. We did not find any difference in pure gleno-humeral 
      abduction greater than 14 degrees between the dominant and non-dominant sides in 
      healthy subjects.

TI  - Open rotator cuff repair without acromioplasty.
PG  - 1278-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: In most clinical reports on rotator cuff repair, acromioplasty was 
      done as part of the procedure. In this prospective study, we evaluated the 
      hypothesis that rotator cuff repair without acromioplasty would result in a 
      substantial improvement in shoulder comfort and function. METHODS: Ninety-six 
      consecutive primary repairs of full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff were 
      performed through a deltoid-muscle-splitting incision that preserved the 
      integrity of the coracoacromial arch and the deltoid insertion. All patients were 
      invited to participate in a prospective study involving periodic self-assessment 
      of shoulder function with the Simple Shoulder Test and general health status with 
      the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire, both of which are validated instruments. 
      Sixty-one patients provided follow-up information for at least two years 
      postoperatively, and the average duration of follow-up was five years. 
      Thirty-four of the tears involved the supraspinatus tendon alone; sixteen 
      involved the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons; and eleven involved the 
      supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis tendons. RESULTS: The percentage 
      of shoulders that could be used to perform each of the twelve functions on the 
      Simple Shoulder Test was significantly increased postoperatively (p < 0.002). Men 
      and women had different degrees of function preoperatively (p < 0.00000001) and 
      postoperatively (p < 0.001), but the improvement in function was essentially 
      identical for the two genders. The mean improvement in the number of shoulder 
      tests that could be performed was best for the patients with one-tendon tears 
      (4.9 tests), next best for those with two-tendon tears (3.6 tests), and worst for 
      those with three-tendon tears (3.3 tests). SF-36 scores for physical role (p < 
      0.003) and comfort (p < 0.0001) were significantly improved postoperatively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvement in self-assessed shoulder comfort and in 
      each of the twelve shoulder functions was observed after rotator cuff repairs 
      performed without acromioplasty. The technique that we used is very similar to 
      that described by Codman almost seventy years ago.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The acromion marker cluster (AMC) is a non-invasive scapular motion 
      tracking method. However, it lacks testing in clinical populations, where unique 
      challenges may present. This investigation resolved the utility of the AMC 
      approach in a compromised clinical population. METHODS: The upper body of breast 
      cancer survivors (BCS) and controls were tracked via motion capture and scapular 
      landmarks palpated and recorded using a digitizer at static neutral to maximum 
      elevation postures. The AMC tracked the scapula during dynamic maximum arm 
      abduction. Both single (SC) and double calibration (DC) methods were applied to 
      calculate scapular angles. The influences of calibration method, elevation, and 
      group on mean and absolute error with two-way fixed ANOVAs with interactions 
      (p < 0.05). Root mean square errors (RMSE) were calculated and compared. RESULTS: 
      DC improved AMC estimation of palpated scapular orientation over SC, especially 
      at higher arm elevations; RMSE averaged 11° higher for SC than DC at maximum 
      elevation, but the methods were only 2.2° different at 90° elevation. DC of the 
      AMC yielded mean error values of ∼5-10°. These approximate errors reported for 
      AMC with young, lean adults. CONCLUSIONS: The AMC with DC is a non-invasive 
      method with acceptable error for measuring scapular motion of BCS and age-matched 
      controls.

      reliability of the test battery was evaluated for 15 women with FMS. Interrater 
      reliability was calculated on 4 tests separately. Fifteen healthy women 
      constituted a reference group. RESULTS: The intrarater coefficient of variation 
      was < 8% for the shoulder range of motion tests, chair test, and 6-minute walk 
      test, and < 21% for the shoulder endurance test, with correlation coefficients 
      above 0.80 for all tests. Kappa was 0.70-0.80 for the hand-to-scapula tests. The 
      interrater coefficient of variation was < 5% for shoulder range of motion. The 
      performances of the FMS patients were significantly decreased in comparison with 
      healthy subjects in all the tests except for the hand-to-scapula movement. 
      CONCLUSIONS: All but 1 of the selected 7 tests were considered to possess 
      acceptable intrarater reliability for use in FMS in clinical physical therapy 
      practice.

TI  - Anatomy of the normal acromion investigated using MRI.
PG  - 141-4
AB  - The shape of the acromion is strongly associated with impingement syndrome and 
      with rotator cuff tears. It is notoriously difficult to image the acromion with 
      conventional radiography. We have developed MRI techniques to depict the acromion 
      in its longitudinal axis. Furthermore, we have measured the subacromial space in 
      both external and internal rotation. In previous studies, three types of acromial 
      shape have been described with the type III or hooked acromion being present in 
      66% of cases with rotator cuff tears. We studied 31 normal shoulders in 29 people 
      using MRI. Within this population aged 24-36 years, mean age 31 years, no type 
      III acromions were found. Twenty-one were type I (67.7%) and 10 were type II 
      (32.3%). In addition, we found no difference in subacromial height in external or 
      internal rotation. Low rates of intra- and interobserver error were found. These 
      results imply that the hooked acromion is not present in the normal population 
      and is, therefore, likely to be an acquired abnormality.

TI  - Arthroscopic subacromial decompression: a clinical review.
PG  - 141-7
AB  - Arthroscopic subacromial decompression has become a popular technique supplanting 
      the open Neer acromioplasty in many instances of chronic rotator cuff disease. A 
      review of 61 consecutive decompressions with a minimum follow-up of 12 months was 
      undertaken to evaluate preoperative criteria and surgical outcomes. Of the 61 
      patients, 53 patients with an average follow-up of 23 months were available for 
      review. Thirty-four men and 19 women with an average age of 47 years comprised 
      the study group. Eleven (21%) had full-thickness tears, 35 (66%) had 
      partial-thickness injuries, and 7 (13%) had normal-appearing rotator cuffs at the 
      time of arthroscopy. The UCLA shoulder rating system was used to evaluate 
      outcome. Eighty-one percent of the patients had an excellent (32%) or good (49%) 
      result whereas 19% (15% fair and 4% poor) were considered unsatisfactory. Those 
      with early impingement findings and partial rotator cuff tears were likely to 
      experience a satisfactory outcome. Patients with full-thickness rotator cuff 
      tears were less likely to experience a successful result (55%). Workmen's 
      compensation cases had a satisfactory outcome in 74%, with a predominance of good 
      over excellent results. Excluding those with full-thickness tears and 
      work-related injuries, a satisfactory outcome was achieved in 90%. Arthroscopic 
      subacromial decompression for mechanical impingement of the rotator cuff is a 
      technically demanding procedure requiring appropriate skills as well as careful 
      preoperative treatment and evaluation. For individuals in whom conservative 
      measures fail and who meet stringent criteria, namely, a largely intact rotator 
      cuff and a non-work-related injury, a highly reliable and satisfying outcome can 
      be anticipated by both patient and surgeon.

TI  - [Arthroscopic stabilisation of acute acromioclavicular dislocation using the 
      TighRope device].
PG  - 386-90
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To present the TightRope (Arthrex, Naples, FL) technique 
      and its results in the arthroscopic stabilisation of acute acromioclavicular 
      joint (ACJ) dislocation carried out at our department. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 
      July 2009 till December 2010, arthroscopic stabilisation of acute ACJ dislocation 
      was performed in 22 patients. The group consisted of 18 men and four women with 
      an average age of 37.4 years. The Rockwood type III to type V ACJ dislocations 
      (III, 16; IV, 1; V, 5) were indicated for surgery. The average interval between 
      injury and surgery was 5.4 days. In all cases, a second-generation TightRope 
      implant was inserted by the EndoButton technique joining the distal end of the 
      clavicle and the coracoid process. The results were evaluated using the UCLA 
      Shoulder Scale at 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: All 22 patients returned to 
      their pre-operative activities without any restriction of shoulder motion within 
      5 months of surgery. The average post-operative UCLA score was 31.2 points 
      (range, 28 to 35). Radiographic evidence of the loss of full reduction, with no 
      effect on the clinical outcome, was recorded in four patients (18%) during 
      post-operative rehabilitation. Of these, one had Rockwood type III, two had type 
      IV and one had type V dislocations. One patient suffered post-operative pull-out 
      of the implant from the coracoid; three patients showed skin wound healing by 
      second intention above the lateral clavicle, with one requiring surgical repair 
      under local anaesthesia. There was no neurovascular complication, intra- or 
      postoperative fracture of the coracoid process or lateral clavicle, or deep wound 
      infection. DISCUSSION: Arthroscopic stabilisation of acute ACJ dislocation is a 
      minimally invasive procedure providing the coracoclavicular ligament complex with 
      dynamic stability. In comparison with open procedures, it is less painful 
      post-operatively, allows the patients to return early to daily activities and has 
      a better cosmetic effect. It eliminates the necessity of removing the 
      osteosynthetic material, as is the case in commonly used techniques such as 
      Bosworth's method, K-wiring, osteorrhaphy or hook plate insertion. The loss of 
      full reduction in four patients, as observed on radiographs during their 
      rehabilitation, was not accompanied by any clinical problems and is in agreement 
      with the findings of other authors. In our group, it occurred in Rockwood grade 
      IV and grade V dislocations. For these, there is a possibility of using two 
      implants in order to increase stability and prevent the loss of full reduction 
      but this involves a higher risk of coracoid fracture, extension of operative time 
      and higher costs. However, a loss of reduction in some patients has also been 
      reported by the authors who have used two implants. Therefore we prefer using a 
      single TightRope implant, particularly in acute grade III ACJ dislocations 
      requiring surgical treatment in patients engaged in repetitive overhead 
      activities related to sports or occupation. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic 
      stabilisation of acute ACJ dislocations using a single TightRope implant is an 
      elegant minimally invasive method with good results in indicated cases. It proves 
      efficient particularly in Rockwood type III injuries in patients who have to do 
      repetitive overhead activities. Acute type IV and type V ACJ dislocations treated 
      by this technique show a loss of full reduction on radiographs more frequently, 
      although no effect on the clinical outcome is evident.

TI  - Training induces scapular dyskinesis in pain-free competitive swimmers: a 
      reliability and observational study.
PG  - 109-13
LID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e3182041de0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Scapular dyskinesis is a major etiological factor in overhead 
      athletes' shoulder problems. Our hypotheses were to evaluate if (1) visual 
      observation of scapular dyskinesis during scaption has substantial interobserver 
      reliability, and (2) scapular dyskinesis may be induced by swim training in 
      pain-free swimmers. DESIGN: A reliability and observational study. SETTING: 
      Bachelor project at a college institution and at a private sports orthopedic 
      hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-eight competitive swimmers with no history of 
      shoulder pain were included in the study. Fourteen swimmers were evaluated 
      regarding reliability. Inclusion criteria were competitive swimmers with high 
      training volume who previously had no shoulder pain. INTERVENTIONS: Observations 
      of scapular dyskinesis (yes/no) during simple scaption. The interobserver 
      reliability of scaption and wall push-up was evaluated in 14 swimmers using kappa 
      analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of scapular dyskinesis at 4 time 
      intervals during a swim training session. RESULTS: The scaption test resulted in 
      a weighted kappa value of 0.75. Scapular dyskinesis was seen in 29 shoulders 
      (37%) after the first time interval, in another 24 (cumulated prevalence 68%) 
      after one-half of the training session, and in an additional 4 swimmers 
      (cumulated prevalence 73%) after three-quarters of the training session. During 
      the last quarter of the training session, another 7 swimmers had dyskinesis, 
      resulting in a cumulated prevalence of 82%. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of 
      abnormal scapular kinesis during a normal training session is high in previously 
      pain-free swimmers. The prevalence increases with more training and occurs early 
      during the training session.

TI  - Measuring humeral head translation using fluoroscopy: a validation study.
PG  - 771-4
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.10.034 [doi]
AB  - Numerous techniques have been employed to monitor humeral head translation due to 
      its involvement with several shoulder pathologies. However, most of the 
      techniques were not validated. The objective of this study is to compare the 
      accuracy of manual digitization and contour registration in measuring superior 
      translation of the humeral head. Eight pairs of cadaver scapulae and humerii 
      bones were harvested for this study. Each scapula and humerus was secured in a 
      customized jig that allowed for control of humeral head translations and a vise 
      that permitted rotations of the scapula about three axes. Fluoroscopy was used to 
      take images of the shoulder bones. Scapular orientation was manipulated in 
      different positions while the humerus was at 90 degrees of humeral elevation in 
      the scapular plane. Humeral head translation was measured using the two methods 
      and was compared to the known translation. Additionally, accuracy of the contour 
      registration method to measure 2-D scapular rotations was assessed. The range for 
      the root mean square (RMS) error for manual digitization method was 0.27 mm-0.43 
      mm and the contour registration method had a RMS error ranging from 0.18 mm-0.40 
      mm. In addition, the RMS error for the scapular angle rotation using the contour 
      registration method was 2.4 degrees . Both methods showed acceptable errors. 
      However, on average, the contour registration method showed lesser measurement 
      error compared to the manual digitization method. In addition, the contour 
      registration method was able to show good accuracy in measuring rotation that is 
      useful in 2-D image analysis.

TI  - Alterations in scapular position with fatigue: a study in swimmers.
PG  - 251-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use two commonly accepted measurement techniques to determine 
      whether intense swimming exercise altered scapular position in male high school 
      swimmers. Scapular position differences between dominant and nondominant 
      shoulders were also investigated. DESIGN: A pilot study on 10 asymptomatic male 
      volunteers established the reliability of the scapular position measurement 
      techniques described by DiVeta and Kibler (intratester intraclass correlation 
      coefficients 0.86-0.98). Scapular position was prospectively recorded before and 
      after swimming practice just prior to tapering for championship competition. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Twenty male high school swimmers from two local teams, ages 13 to 
      18 years. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects completed their usual 2-hour swimming practice 
      at the peak of their training intensity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in 
      scapular position preexercise versus postexercise. RESULTS: Scapular position did 
      not change preexercise to postexercise for either the DiVeta (22.2 +/- 1.4 to 
      22.3 +/- 1.5 cm, p = 0.96) or Kibler (9.2 +/- 1.4 to 9.4 +/- 1.3 cm, p = 1.00) 
      measures. Nondominant preexercise scapular position was generally more medial and 
      moved laterally with exercise, becoming roughly equivalent to the dominant 
      shoulder. CONCLUSION: The DiVeta and Kibler scapular position measurement 
      techniques are acceptably reliable. However these techniques generally failed to 
      demonstrate significant changes in scapular position after intense swimming 
      exercise in the study population. Nondominant side scapulae typically moved 
      laterally postexercise. These findings and implications are discussed.

TI  - Three-dimensional scapular kinematics during the throwing motion.
PG  - 24-34
AB  - Proper scapular motion is crucial for normal shoulder mechanics. Scapular motion 
      affects glenohumeral joint function during throwing, yet little is known about 
      this dynamic activity. Asymptomatic subjects (10 male and 10 female), ages 21 to 
      45, were analyzed. Electromagnetic surface sensors on the sternum, acromion, and 
      humerus were used to collect 3-D motion data during three trials of low-velocity 
      throwing. Scapular angular position data were described or five predetermined 
      events throughout the throw corresponding with classic descriptions of throwing 
      phases, and trial-to-trial reliability was determined. ANOVA compared scapular 
      angles across events. Subjects demonstrated good to excellent reliability between 
      trials of the throw (ICC 0.74-0.98). The scapula demonstrated a pattern of 
      external rotation, upward rotation (peak of approx. 40 degrees), and poster 
      humeral horizontal abduction. During the arm acceleration phase, the scapula 
      moved toward greater internal rotation and began anteriorly tilting. At maximum 
      humeral internal rotation, the scapula ended in internal rotation (55 degrees), 
      upward rotation (20 degrees), and anterior tilting (3 degrees). Significant 
      differences in scapular position (p<0.05) were identified across the throwing 
      motion. Scapular data identify events in the throwing motion in which throwers 
      may be more susceptible to shoulder pathologies related to abnormal scapular 
      kinematics.

TI  - An objective measurement technique for posterior scapular displacement.
PG  - 336-41
AB  - Contemporary shoulder rehabilitation programs emphasize scapular control in the 
      treatment of shoulder pathology. In addition, scapular winging and scapular 
      tipping are often cited as key components to both the evaluative and 
      rehabilitative phase of treatment. However, the lack of objective measurement 
      procedures makes clinical evaluation of these phenomena difficult. The purpose of 
      this project was to develop a reliable technique to quantify posterior scapular 
      displacement (direction of scapular movement for winging and/or tipping). Forty 
      healthy subjects (21 males, 19 females) who reported no current shoulder pain 
      participated in this study. A measurement instrument was designed to quantify, to 
      the nearest whole degree of motion, the posterior displacement of the inferior 
      angle of the scapula from the posterior thorax. Subjects' scapulae were each 
      measured two times without holding weight (unweighted position) and two times 
      while the subjects held 10% of their body weight (weighted position). During all 
      trials, two testers were blinded from the measurement readings. Intraclass 
      correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated based on a repeated measure 
      analysis of variance to determine intertester and intratester reliability. The 
      standard error of measurement (SEM) was used to determine the measurement error. 
      Intratester within-day reliability ICCs ranged from 0.97 to 0.98, and SEM ranged 
      from 0.6 to 1.1 degrees. Intertester within-day reliability ICCs ranged from 0.92 
      to 0.97, and SEM ranged between 1.1 and 1.7 degrees. None of the calculated p 
      values for intratester and intertester reliability were statistically significant 
      (p < 0.05). We conclude that this measurement technique is a reliable method to 
      quantify posterior scapular displacement. Further research utilizing this 
      measurement technique is recommended.

TI  - Arm EMG during abduction and adduction: hysteresis cycle.
PG  - 317-20
AB  - The electromyographic study of the muscles involved in the complex movements of 
      the shoulder, is usually one way to quantifying the static and dynamic joint's 
      behavior. In particular, the deltoid medium EMG produced a phenomenon similar to 
      a hysteresis cycle when its amplitude was plotted as a function of the lateral 
      angular position during a static, step by step, sequential abduction-adduction of 
      the arm. Such a cycle was consistently repeated in 16 subjects (12 males and 4 
      females). The paired Student t-test, after comparing the mean EMG values of the 
      rectified wave for the same arm opening angle between abduction and adduction, 
      produced a highly significant difference (alpha<0.001) in all subjects. In all 
      likelihood, it manifests the participation of muscles other than the deltoid 
      medium in the overall movement (as for example, the anterior and posterior 
      deltoids), that is, they are collaborating muscles that are different in the 
      opening or lifting of the arm from those involved in its closure or lowering. 
      Thus, it is concluded that a quantifiable and significant deltoid medium EMG 
      difference has been demonstrated when the muscle is either ready to abduction or 
      ready to adduction. The effect is fully reproducible between 0 and 90 degrees of 
      an arm in static position within the scapular plane.

TI  - Patient outcome after surgical management of an accessory nerve injury.
PG  - 221-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed patient outcome following surgical reconstruction 
      of the accessory nerve after an iatrogenic injury. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective 
      chart review of 8 patients was performed. RESULTS: There were 3 men and 5 women 
      in the study, and the mean time between injury and nerve graft/repair surgery was 
      5 months. Four injuries were sustained during a lymph node biopsy. 
      Electromyography revealed a complete accessory nerve injury in all cases. In 6 
      cases, a nerve graft was required (mean length, 3.6 cm), and in 2 cases, a direct 
      nerve repair was possible. The trapezius muscle was successfully reinnervated in 
      all cases. In total, full shoulder abduction was achieved in 6 cases; in the 
      remaining 2 cases, the patients achieved shoulder abduction to 90 degrees. 
      CONCLUSION: Functional deficit after accessory nerve injury is significant. Nerve 
      graft/repair reconstruction reliably yields a satisfactory result, providing good 
      scapular rotation and thus good shoulder function.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of the subacromial space in the impingement 
      sign positions.
PG  - 595-9
AB  - External shoulder impingement is commonly diagnosed by passively moving the 
      shoulder into various positions of elevation and internal rotation in order to 
      perform impingement sign maneuvers. There is a lack of agreement among clinicians 
      regarding the positions of the anatomic structures in the subacromial space when 
      these maneuvers are performed. The purpose of this study was to use magnetic 
      resonance imaging to identify and measure the changes in anatomic structures in 
      the subacromial space as the arm was moved from complete rest to 160 degrees of 
      forward flexion during the Neer and Hawkins impingement sign maneuvers. Ten 
      subjects with normal shoulders (mean age, 32 years) were studied. The 
      acromiohumeral interval was smallest with the arm at the side (mean, 6.4 mm) and 
      progressively increased as the arm was elevated from 90 degrees to 160 degrees 
      (mean, 7.7-14.2 mm). In no instance was the rotator cuff found to be in contact 
      with the anterior acromion. The rotator cuff insertion appeared to be in closest 
      proximity to the anteroinferior acromion, not at full elevation (Neer sign 
      position), but at 90 degrees of flexion (Hawkins sign position). Our data suggest 
      that a clinically positive Hawkins sign is consistent with external shoulder 
      impingement. Clinical suspicion that mechanisms other than impingement may be 
      involved, particularly if the Neer impingement sign is also positive, is 
      nonetheless advised.

TI  - Interrater Reliability of a Novel Goniometric Technique to Measure Scapular 
      Protraction and Retraction.
LID - 7601205010 [pii]
LID - 10.5014/ajot.2022.045765 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Scapular protraction and retraction are often essential for 
      occupational performance; however, clinical assessment of these movements is 
      uniquely challenging. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the interrater reliability of a novel 
      goniometric method to measure scapular protraction and retraction. DESIGN: An 
      observational, descriptive design was implemented to evaluate interrater 
      reliability between two experienced occupational therapists who were also 
      certified hand therapists. SETTING: Academic institution. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Convenience sample of graduate students (N = 80). Outcomes and Measures: The 
      hypothesis, developed before study implementation, was that the technique would 
      demonstrate clinically acceptable interrater reliability, defined as a standard 
      error of measurement (SEM) <8°. Goniometric measurements of the scapula at rest, 
      in maximal protraction, and in maximal retraction were independently obtained 
      from each participant by each evaluator. The goniometer was aligned on the 
      scapula using the superior angle as the axis of motion to measure the movement of 
      the acromion relative to the frontal plane. The SEM was calculated in each 
      position using the intraclass correlation coefficient values and the average of 
      the standard deviations from the two raters. RESULTS: The SEM values between the 
      two evaluators for the resting, protracted, and retracted positions were 3.46°, 
      2.93°, and 2.74°, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The SEM between the 
      two evaluators for each scapular position was <4°, suggesting that the technique 
      may be clinically reliable. However, additional research regarding the 
      reliability and validity of the technique is recommended. What This Article Adds: 
      The findings of this study support the use of goniometry to measure scapular 
      protraction and retraction in relation to occupational performance. The technique 
      provides a way to quantify baseline scapular mobility and track progress.

TI  - Assessment of shoulder strength in professional baseball pitchers.
PG  - 544-51
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A bilateral comparison of strength and range of motion testing in 
      professional baseball pitchers. OBJECTIVE: We studied 39 professional male 
      baseball pitchers to determine if the shoulder used for throwing was weaker or 
      had less passive range of motion, compared to the nondominant arm. BACKGROUND: 
      Shoulder muscle weakness has been proposed as a possible risk factor for 
      developing injury. Therefore, objective quantification of the strength of 
      glenohumeral and scapular rotator muscle groups should be studied in a population 
      of professional baseball pitchers. METHODS AND MEASURES: Passive internal and 
      external range of motion was bilaterally measured at 90 degrees of abduction. 
      Muscle strength of the following muscles was measured bilaterally with a 
      hand-held dynamometer: external and internal glenohumeral rotators, 
      supraspinatus, middle trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior. RESULTS: 
      Passive external rotation of the glenohumeral joint at 90 degrees of abduction on 
      the pitching side was significantly greater than on the nonpitching side. Passive 
      internal rotation range of motion on the nonpitching side was significantly 
      greater than on the pitching side. The pitching arm's internal rotators, when 
      tested in abduction, were significantly stronger than the nonpitching arm. The 
      nonpitching arm's external rotators in the plane of the scapula, and in 
      abduction, were significantly greater than those of the pitching arm. The 
      pitching arm's middle and lower trapezius muscles were significantly stronger 
      than those of the nonpitching arm. CONCLUSION: The range of motion and strength 
      characteristics measured in this study can assist clinicians in evaluating 
      athletes who use overhead throwing motions.

TI  - Results of arthroscopic subacromial decompression in patients with subacromial 
      impingement and glenohumeral degenerative joint disease.
PG  - 299-304
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of shoulder arthroscopy 
      with subacromial decompression in patients with concurrent glenohumeral 
      arthrosis. A retrospective review of 36 patients who had arthroscopic subacromial 
      decompression with concurrent glenohumeral degenerative joint disease was 
      conducted. Office charts, operative notes, standard shoulder questionnaires, 
      radiographs, and clinical examinations were used. The mean age of patients was 61 
      years, with 5-year follow-up. Patients with Outerbridge grade 1, 2, or 3 changes 
      on either the glenoid or humerus had a mean final L'Insalata score of 90. Ten 
      patients with grade 4 changes registered an ultimate score of 50. Radiographic 
      arthrosis correlated similarly but with less reliability. Arthroscopic 
      subacromial decompression for resistant impingement symptoms in the face of mild 
      to moderate glenohumeral degenerative joint disease can improve shoulder function 
      and provide durable results. Full-thickness loss of articular cartilage or 
      radiographically severe degenerative joint disease had less predictable results.

TI  - [Fusion and function after eight scapulothoracic arthrodesis].
PG  - 649-58
LID - 10.1016/j.rco.2008.02.003 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Scapula alata resulting from a deficient musculus serratus 
      anterior leads to shoulder instability, pain and loss of elevation. Etiologies 
      include fascioscapulohumeral dystrophy and lesion of the thoracicus longus nerve. 
      Dynamic (muscle transfer) or static (scapulopexia or scapulothoracic arthrodesis) 
      stabilization methods can be proposed. The purpose of this study was to assess 
      fusion and function after eight scapulothoracic arthrodeses performed in five 
      patients. We used cerclage with compression after intercostal avivement to 
      increase the contact surface. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study 
      included four men and one woman. Three patients had fascioscapulohumeral 
      dystrophy who underwent bilateral arthrodeses and two patients with 
      post-traumatic injury to one thoracicus longus nerve. All scapulothoracic joints 
      were unstable; six were painful. There was a cosmetic prejudice in all cases. 
      Preoperative function was 71+/-6 degrees antepulsion (range: 60-80 degrees ) and 
      71+/-7 degrees abduction (range: 60-80 degrees ). Postoperative assessment 
      included: reduction of the scapula alata, gain in motion, Constant score (raw and 
      weighed), subjective assessment of daily activity, complications, respiratory 
      function in patients with double arthrodesis and bone fusion on the CT scan. 
      RESULTS: Patient follow-up was 21.5 months on average. The scapula alata was 
      reduced in all cases. Mean gain in motion was 39+/-21 degrees antepulsion and 
      41+/-26 degrees abduction. The raw Constant score was 77.75+/-11.4/100 and the 
      weighted score was 81.5+/-9.1/100. Daily activity was scored 100% in four of five 
      patients. Complications were transient intercostal dysesthesia, mild 
      exercise-induced pain, one pneumothorax which did not require drainage. There was 
      no evidence of an impact on respiratory function. The control scans revealed 
      fusion in five shoulders and nonunion in three. DISCUSSION: Scapulothoracic 
      arthrodesis enabled reduction of the scapula alata and improved shoulder function 
      for elevation and daily activities. The gain in motion and Constant score were 
      satisfactory and similar to other results in the literature. The main drawback 
      was deficient external rotation. Pain was mild and resulted from the 
      deafferentation. It resolved six months postoperatively. Secondary 
      exercise-related pain was mild with little impact. Technically, authors have 
      proposed using different ribs for the fusion, depending on the patient's 
      morphology and searching for a good position for the scapula for external 
      rotation. There have been few postoperative complications: we had one 
      pneumothorax and no neurological, vascular or pulmonary complications. Our 
      results are the first reporting CT fusion findings. Indirect signs of nonunion on 
      plain x-rays reported in earlier studies are not fully reliable, since our CT 
      scans demonstrated nonunion in three shoulders. The lack of fusion does not mean 
      poor function, as was also noted by others, since function was improved (mean 
      gain 27 degrees flexion and 25 degrees abduction).

TI  - The glenohumeral joint rotation centre in vivo.
PG  - 1629-36
AB  - Within the framework of the current call for standardization in upper extremity 
      research, three methods to determine the glenohumeral joint rotation centre in 
      vivo were tested. Therefore, subjects performed humeral movements, while a 3D 
      electromagnetic tracking device registered the motion of the humerus with respect 
      to the scapula. For the first method to estimate the glenohumeral joint rotation 
      centre five scapular bony landmarks served as input to regression equations. The 
      second method fitted a sphere through the humeral position data and the third 
      method calculated the rotation centre determining an optimal helical axis. The 
      experiment consisted of two parts, at first one subject was measured 10 times, 
      subsequently one observer measured 10 subjects twice and another observer 
      measured these subjects once. The first part of the experiment demonstrated that 
      all methods are capable to reproduce the rotation centre within 4mm, but the 
      location of the centre differed significantly between methods (p<0.001). The 
      second part, showed that inter- and intra-observer reliability was sufficiently 
      for the sphere-fitting method and for the helical-axes method. The two 
      observations of one observer differed significantly (p<0.008) using the 
      regression method. The authors prefer the helical-axes method, it is a reliable 
      and valid method which can be applied in movement registration of healthy 
      subjects and patients with a shoulder endoprosthesis, it can be applied in hinge 
      joints to determine a rotation axis instead of a rotation centre which is 
      desirable in standardized upper extremity research, and calculation time is 
      short.

AB  - This work presents an accurate method to measure gleno-humeral translations in a 
      controlled pseudo-kinematic environment. Low-dose biplanar X-rays were acquired 
      from nine healthy subjects at three elevations of the arm in the scapular plane. 
      On each set of images, shoulder bony landmarks were manually located in 3D using 
      a dedicated software. Intra-observer and inter-observer repeatability of landmark 
      identification, as well as humeral head center (GH) translations, were studied. 
      Repeatability for the identification of GH in the global coordinate system (CS) 
      was good with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) ranging from 0.57 to 2.25 mm. 
      Scapular landmark CIs ranged from 0.80 to 12 mm. Gleno-humeral translations of 
      small amplitude ( < 6 mm) were detected in seven out of nine subjects. The 
      results obtained here confirm that calibrated low-dose stereo-radiography is a 
      promising tool for the functional analysis of the shoulder.

TI  - The scapulo-humeral rhythm: effects of 2-D roentgen projection.
PG  - 63-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to illustrate the low accuracy of 
      two-dimensional (2-D) X-ray projection methods for the quantification of the 
      three-dimensional (3-D) shoulder motions. BACKGROUND: The traditional method for 
      the quantification of the gleno-humeral motion is by means of 2-D X-ray 
      recording. The motion was characterized by the scapulo-humeral rhythm: the ratio 
      of the nett humeral elevation over nett scapular rotation. The method was based 
      on the quantification of the planar projection of the spatial positions of X-ray 
      dense structures of the scapula. The deformations introduced by the central 
      projection method, a feature of X-ray projection, cannot be compensated for by 
      calibration: the position of the scapula with respect to the camera setting is 
      unknown, and skeletal landmarks of the scapula cannot uniquely be identified. The 
      transformation from 3-D orientations to 2-D angles will, therefore, be 
      inaccurate. METHODS: A 2-D X-ray projection of the scapula during a typical arm 
      abduction was simulated. The 3-D motion was obtained by means of palpation and 
      subsequent digitization of skeletal landmarks of the scapula. The 3-D positions 
      of the recorded landmarks were projected on a plane by a simulation based on the 
      parameters of the X-ray equipment. The scapulo-humeral rhythm was calculated for 
      the different scapular landmarks, and for the orientation of the subject with 
      respect to the projection axis. The results were compared with previous published 
      scapulo-humeral rhythms. RESULTS: The scapulo-humeral rhythm depends both on the 
      choice of the skeletal landmarks, used to quantify the scapular rotations, and on 
      the orientation of the subject in the X-ray setting. The full range of results 
      obtained from earlier published experiments could be obtained from a simulation 
      based on a single 3-D arm abduction. CONCLUSIONS: The 2-D scapulo-humeral rhythm, 
      obtained from planar X-ray projection, is an inaccurate parameter to define the 
      scapular motions. RELEVANCE: The 2-D scapulo-humeral rhythm is an insensitive 
      parameter to identify clinical disorders in the gleno-humeral motions, 3-D motion 
      recording should be applied. Only when stringent precautions are taken with 
      respect to repeatability of positioning of the subjects, can the method be used 
      to study intra-individual effects, e.g., the follow-up of patients during 
      treatment.

TI  - Proximally based conjoined tendon transfer for coracoclavicular reconstruction in 
      the treatment of acromioclavicular dislocation.
PG  - 2408-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report an alternative to the modified Weaver-Dunn technique that 
      can achieve stable coracoclavicular reconstruction while avoiding sacrifice of 
      the coracoacromial arch. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze 
      the functional outcomes and radiographic features of patients treated with 
      coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction with use of a proximally based conjoined 
      tendon transfer. METHODS: The cases of thirty-eight patients with type-IV, 
      type-V, and selected type-III acromioclavicular dislocations according to the 
      Rockwood classification system, who were followed for an average follow-up of 
      38.7 months, were evaluated retrospectively. Transfer of the lateral half of the 
      conjoined tendon to the distal aspect of the clavicle in a proximally based 
      fashion, with additional coracoclavicular fixation, was performed in all 
      patients. At the latest follow-up evaluation, radiographic analysis and the 
      scores on the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Constant and Murley, and 
      Simple Shoulder Test questionnaires were used to provide a final evaluation of 
      shoulder function. The ability to return to work and the ability to return to 
      sports were also recorded. RESULTS: At the time of final follow-up, the mean 
      American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score was 91.4, with a mean pain score on 
      the visual analog scale of 1.8, mean forward flexion of 148.2 degrees , and mean 
      external rotation of 38.0 degrees . The mean Constant and Murley score was 90.6. 
      The new number of positive answers on the Simple Shoulder Test was 10.9. The 
      overall rate of satisfaction (an excellent or good result) was 89% (thirty-four 
      patients). Thirty-five (92%) of the thirty-eight patients returned to their 
      previous work, and thirty-two (84%) returned to their preinjury level of sports. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The proximally based conjoined tendon transfer is a reliable 
      treatment for a high-grade acromioclavicular dislocation. The lateral half of the 
      conjoined tendon is a safe graft source with ample length, and this technique 
      avoids sacrifice of the coracoacromial ligament.

TI  - Shoulder girdle elevation during neurodynamic testing: an assessable sign?
PG  - 88-96
AB  - One of the signs advocated for monitoring during neurodynamic testing in the 
      assessment of patients with upper quadrant disorders, is the response of the 
      shoulder girdle. It is stated that a protective rising of the shoulder girdle is 
      present when patients with neurogenic disorders are assessed and that the 
      elevation is absent in asymptomatic subjects. As sensory responses are elicited 
      in the majority of asymptomatic subjects and as the range of motion (ROM) is 
      often limited during neurodynamic testing, it is questionable whether the 
      elevation of the shoulder girdle would be absent in asymptomatic subjects. The 
      aim of this study was to measure the shoulder girdle elevation force during five 
      variants of the neural tissue provocation test for the median nerve. Thirty-five 
      asymptomatic male subjects were assessed. A load cell was used to measure the 
      amount of shoulder girdle elevation force and two electrogoniometers were used to 
      measure the ROM at the elbow and wrist. When the ROM at the end of the test was 
      restricted, a gradual increase in shoulder girdle elevation force could be 
      observed throughout the test. Compared to the initial force at the start of the 
      test, all variants resulted in a significant increase in force. It is concluded 
      that a gradual increase in shoulder girdle elevation force should not be regarded 
      as an abnormal sign in the interpretation of neurodynamic tests.

TI  - Assessment of radiolucent lines about the glenoid. An in vitro radiographic 
      study.
PG  - 428-32
AB  - A study was undertaken to investigate the precision of plain radiographs in the 
      assessment of the width of radiolucent lines and to define parameters for more 
      accurate measurement. A metal-backed glenoid component was inserted into fourteen 
      cadaveric scapulae; the component had a radiolucent spacer at the central post to 
      provide a gap with a known width at the component-bone interface. The specimens 
      were mounted in a custom-designed jig, and initial radiographs were made with the 
      glenoid in neutral version; sequential radiographs then were made, at 5-degree 
      intervals, with the glenoid in 0 to 40 degrees of anteversion and retroversion. 
      Four independent observers with various levels of experience measured the width 
      of the radiolucent lines with use of digital microcalipers. Osteometric analysis 
      demonstrated that normal glenoid version ranged from 3 degrees of anteversion to 
      13 degrees of retroversion; these values were similar to those reported in 
      previous studies. Radiographic analysis showed that accurate measurement of the 
      width of the gap was dependent on the position of the glenoid. The measured 
      widths of the radiolucent lines were significantly smaller than the known width 
      of the gap when retroversion was 10 degrees or more and when anteversion was 15 
      degrees or more (p < or = 0.05). Radiolucent lines were not consistently observed 
      on radiographs that were made with the glenoid in more than 20 degrees of 
      anteversion and retroversion. An analysis of interobserver error showed close 
      agreement among the measurements made by the different observers when the glenoid 
      was in 0 and 5 degrees of rotation, with decreased agreement when the glenoid was 
      rotated more than 10 degrees from neutral. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Inaccurate 
      positioning of the patient and anatomical variation in glenoid version may 
      explain the variability in the reported onsets, progressions, and frequencies of 
      radiographic loosening of glenoid components. The findings of the present study 
      also may help to explain the poor association between clinical and radiographic 
      findings reported for patients who have pain at the site of a total shoulder 
      prosthesis. Radiographs made within 10 degrees of neutral should allow accurate 
      assessment of radiolucent lines about the glenoid.

TI  - The treatment of symptomatic os acromiale.
PG  - 325-8
AB  - Os acromiale is an uncommon condition of the shoulder. When symptomatic, os 
      acromiale may cause impingement pain, rotator cuff tears, or pain through 
      abnormal motion at the unfused apophysis. Treatment of symptomatic os acromiale 
      is controversial. This article reports on four patients with symptomatic 
      meso-acromions who were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. All 
      four patients recovered full function postoperatively with UCLA shoulder rating 
      scores improving from 19 preoperatively to 35 postoperatively. Open reduction and 
      internal fixation of a symptomatic meso-acromion is a reliable and reproducible 
      technique in which the deltoid attachment and lever arm are minimally affected.

TI  - Digital fluoroscopic assessment of the scapulohumeral rhythm.
PG  - 241-6
AB  - Previous studies have shown that abnormal rotation of the scapula is associated 
      with shoulder pathology. Among the methods which have been proposed, planar x-ray 
      measurements are probably the only methods, which enable clinicians to assess 
      accurately and objectively the scapulohumeral function in vivo. The aim of this 
      study was to develop a method for the assessment of scapulohumeral kinematics 
      using digital fluoroscopy. Anteroposterior images of the right glenohumeral joint 
      were taken, in thirty-four healthy males, with the arm at rest, 30 degrees, 60 
      degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees, 150 degrees and maximum abduction, in the 
      scapular plane. High inter- and intra-examiner reliability was observed regarding 
      the arm and scapular angle measurements (ICC = 0.92-0.99). The positioning of the 
      arm at the proposed angles was also highly accurate (< 2.3 degrees misplacement) 
      and reproducible (CV% < 5.3%). The mean radiation dose was 0.075 mSv (+/- 0.027 
      mSv). At the resting position the scapula was in slight downward rotation (-2.4 
      degrees +/- 4.3 degrees) and the arm in slight abduction (1.5 degrees +/- 6.6 
      degrees). The mean maximum scapular rotation and the mean maximum arm abduction 
      was 61.4 degrees (+/- 5.2 degrees) and 162.4 degrees (+/- 6.6 degrees) 
      respectively. A curvilinear relationship was found between the arm angle (AA) and 
      the scapular angle (SA) (p < 0.0001). The AA:SA ratio for the entire range of 
      abduction was 2.5:1. The greatest contribution of the scapula (1.7:1) achieved at 
      30 degrees-60 degrees of arm. The high accuracy and reliability of our method and 
      the low radiation recordings suggests that digital fluoroscopy may be considered 
      for further investigation of the scapulohumeral kinematics in both healthy and 
      pathological shoulders.

TI  - Two-dimensional glenoid version measurements vary with coronal and sagittal 
      scapular rotation.
PG  - 692-9
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.I.00177 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate analysis of osseous glenoid morphology is important in 
      treating glenohumeral arthritis and instability. Two-dimensional computed 
      tomography scans are used to evaluate glenoid alignment. Accuracy of this method 
      is dependent on the angle of axial reconstruction in relation to the position of 
      the scapula. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of scapular 
      rotation in the coronal and sagittal planes on glenoid version as measured on 
      two-dimensional images. METHODS: Computer-generated three-dimensional models of 
      scapulae from computed tomography scans of thirty-six shoulders in whole-body 
      cadavers were generated. The anatomic geometry of these models had been 
      previously validated. The position of the scapulae relative to the gantry was 
      determined. The three-dimensional models were rotated in 1 degree increments in 
      the coronal and sagittal planes. Glenoid version was measured on two-dimensional 
      images for each of the rotation increments. Version variability at each rotation 
      increment was calculated. RESULTS: The anatomic glenoid version (independent of 
      the resting position of the scapula) was an average (and standard deviation) of 
      2.0 degrees +/- 3.8 degrees of retroversion. The average difference between 
      anatomic glenoid version and clinical glenoid version (depending on the position 
      of the scapula on the original computed tomography axial images) was 6.9 degrees 
      +/- 5.6 degrees (range, 0.1 degrees to 22.5 degrees). Version variability with 
      coronal or sagittal rotation was significant for all degrees of rotation (p < 
      0.0001). Scapular abduction had the greatest effect on version variation and 
      resulted in 0.42 degrees of relative anteversion for every 1 degree of abduction 
      in the coronal plane. In the sagittal plane, internal rotation resulted in 
      relative anteversion. CONCLUSIONS: Any malalignment of > or = 1 degree of the 
      scapula in the coronal or sagittal plane will create inaccuracies in measuring 
      glenoid version. The plane of axial reconstruction should be aligned with the 
      scapula when two-dimensional computed tomography images are used to measure 
      glenoid version. These findings support the use of three-dimensional models to 
      evaluate glenoid version.

TI  - Measurement of scapular kinematics with the moiré fringe projection technique.
PG  - 1215-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.12.015 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of the moiré fringe 
      projection technique (MFPT) to quantify the scapular motions relative to the 
      thorax. This system was composed of a LCD projector, a digital photographic 
      camera, and a microcomputer. To automatically obtain the scapular profiles, the 
      phase shifting method was combined with the MFPT. Four fringes were projected on 
      the scapula and four on the reference planes. By the simple subtraction of the 
      reference values from the scapular phase maps, the map due to the moiré fringes 
      could be digitally obtained. After the phase decoding, the tridimensional (3D) 
      profiles were obtained without prior information about the samples and the 
      calculations of the scapular kinematics were carried out using dedicated 
      software. On average, the movements of lateral rotation ranged from -1.8+/-6.1 
      degrees to -26.5+/-3.5 degrees; the protraction from 28.4+/-4.7 degrees to 
      27.7+/-6.8 degrees, and the posterior tilt from -6.4+/-7.8 degrees to -21.7+/-6.1 
      degrees, during the arm elevation in the scapular plane performed by six healthy 
      subjects. For the test-retest reliability, the intra-class correlation 
      coefficients ranged from 0.92 to 0.997 and the maximum estimated error was 0.8%. 
      The MFPT allowed the scapular 3D measurements to be obtained in a digital and 
      non-invasive manner. The main advantages compared with other existing systems 
      were its ease in implementation, the use of standard optical components, and its 
      possible clinical applications.

TI  - Proximally based conjoined tendon transfer for coracoclavicular reconstruction in 
      the treatment of acromioclavicular dislocation. Surgical technique.
PG  - 299-308
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.H.00438 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report an alternative to the modified Weaver-Dunn technique that 
      can achieve stable coracoclavicular reconstruction while avoiding sacrifice of 
      the coracoacromial arch. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze 
      the functional outcomes and radiographic features of patients treated with 
      coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction with use of a proximally based conjoined 
      tendon transfer. METHODS: The cases of thirty-eight patients with type-IV, 
      type-V, and selected type-III acromioclavicular dislocations according to the 
      Rockwood classification system, who were followed for an average follow-up of 
      38.7 months, were evaluated retrospectively. Transfer of the lateral half of the 
      conjoined tendon to the distal aspect of the clavicle in a proximally based 
      fashion, with additional coracoclavicular fixation, was performed in all 
      patients. At the latest follow-up evaluation, radiographic analysis and the 
      scores on the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Constant and Murley, and 
      Simple Shoulder Test questionnaires were used to provide a final evaluation of 
      shoulder function. The ability to return to work and the ability to return to 
      sports were also recorded. RESULTS: At the time of final follow-up, the mean 
      American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score was 91.4, with a mean pain score on 
      the visual analog scale of 1.8, mean forward flexion of 148.2 degrees , and mean 
      external rotation of 38.0 degrees . The mean Constant and Murley score was 90.6. 
      The new number of positive answers on the Simple Shoulder Test was 10.9. The 
      overall rate of satisfaction (an excellent or good result) was 89% (thirty-four 
      patients). Thirty-five (92%) of the thirty-eight patients returned to their 
      previous work, and thirty-two (84%) returned to their preinjury level of sports. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The proximally based conjoined tendon transfer is a reliable 
      treatment for a high-grade acromioclavicular dislocation. The lateral half of the 
      conjoined tendon is a safe graft source with ample length, and this technique 
      avoids sacrifice of the coracoacromial ligament.

TI  - Acute acromioclavicular separations. A 20-year study.
PG  - 62-71
AB  - One hundred and twenty-two acromioclavicular separations treated surgically at 
      the Campbell Clinic from 1956 to 1976 have been studied. On group of 44 patients 
      who had primary excision of the distal clavicle with repair of ligaments was 
      compared with another group of 78 patients who had primary repair of the 
      ligaments only. Of the original 122 patients (average age, 27 years; range, 12 to 
      64 years), 112 were male and 10 were female. Eighty-six of the 122 patients were 
      reevaluated (average follow-up, 4.4 years; range, 1 to 16 years). No difference 
      in the two groups was apparent in range of motion or in muscle power/weakness, as 
      tested by resistive examination. There was no correlation between presence or 
      amount of degenerative changes in the acromioclavicular joint and the patient's 
      symptomatology. Of the group who had excision of the distal end of the clavicle, 
      only 4.5% had degenerative joint disease as compared with 24.3% of the other 
      group. Repair of the coracoclavicular and acromioclavicular ligaments, with a 
      beveled excision of the distal 1 cm of clavicle, has been a successful and 
      reliable method for treating Type III (complete disruption of acromioclavicular 
      and coracoclavicular ligaments and tears of deltoid and trapezius muscle 
      attachments from the clavicle) and some Type II (complete disruption of capsule 
      and acromioclavicular ligaments) injuries.

TI  - Dynamic scapulohumeral rhythm: the effects of external resistance during 
      elevation of the arm in the scapular plane.
PG  - 125-33
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize the scapulohumeral rhythm in the 
      normal shoulder during dynamic elevation of the arm in the scapular plane and to 
      compare the scapulohumeral rhythm during three different states of loading: 1) 
      arm completely unloaded and passively elevated, 2) light load consisting of 
      active elevation against the weight of the limb, and 3) heavy loading against 
      maximal resistance. Electromagnetic tracking was used to record three-dimensional 
      scapular and humeral kinematics on 25 normal subjects. Cardan angles were 
      calculated to assess the dynamic relationship of humeral elevation to scapular 
      upward rotation. The results show that during dynamic humeral elevation the 
      scapulohumeral rhythm changes depending on the phase of elevation and the 
      external load on the arm. During passive range of motion, the scapulohumeral 
      rhythm decreased from 7.9:1 to 2.1:1 as the arm was elevated. Light shoulder 
      loads caused an increase of the scapulohumeral rhythm from 3.1:1 to 4.3:1 as the 
      arm was elevated. Heavy shoulder loading resulted in an increasing scapulohumeral 
      rhythm from 1.9:1 to 4.5:1 as the arm was elevated. The results suggest that the 
      historical assumption of a simple linear 2:1 scapulohumeral rhythm ratio may be 
      overly simplistic and may not accurately describe the scapulohumeral rhythm under 
      varying dynamic conditions. Therapists need to understand the normal changing 
      relationships of the scapulohumeral rhythm under different conditions for 
      accurate interpretation of clinical observations.

TI  - Technetium-99m human immunoglobulin scintigraphy in patients with adhesive 
      capsulitis: a correlative study with bone scintigraphy.
PG  - 243-8
AB  - Adhesive capsulitis (AC) is a disorder that is characterized by shoulder pain and 
      progressive limitation of both active and passive shoulder motion. Although the 
      underlying pathological mechanisms of the disease are not well understood, the 
      inflammatory reactions depending on the stage have been demonstrated 
      histologically. The purpose of the study is to investigate the inflammatory 
      changes that can be demonstrated with Tc-99m HIG in AC, and to determine the 
      presence of correlations between scintigraphic findings and the clinical 
      assessment. Twenty-one patients (12 females and 9 males) with a mean age of 
      50.57+/-8.49 were included in the study. AC was diagnosed according to recognized 
      criteria. The planar X-ray images of the affected shoulders of all patients were 
      normal. The patients were evaluated with the Constant Scoring System, and the 
      functional and pain assessment parts of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons' 
      Form (ASES). Three phase bone scans and Tc-99m HIG scintigraphy were performed at 
      least two days apart. Bone scan and Tc-99m HIG scintigraphy were evaluated 
      visually and HIG uptake was evaluated in comparison with the contralateral normal 
      shoulder. Bone scan demonstrated hypervascularity in 9 of the 21 patients (43%), 
      whereas increased osteoblastic activity was detected in 19 (90%) in the affected 
      shoulder. Tc-99m HIG uptake was positive in 12 (57%), and negative in 9 (43%) 
      patients. All patients with increased Tc-99m HIG accumulation in the affected 
      shoulder, also had increased osteoblastic activity on Tc-99m bone scintigraphy. A 
      significant correlation was found between HIG uptake and constant, functional and 
      pain scores. The difference between these scores was also statistically 
      significant in patients with HIG positive and negative uptake. This study 
      indicates that there is a good correlation between Tc-99m HIG scan findings and 
      clinical scores. Tc-99m HIG accumulation in the affected shoulder may be related 
      to continuing inflammatory reaction to AC. Tc-99m HIG scan may be a noninvasive, 
      complementary method for demonstrating continuing inflammatory changes and may 
      help in staging the disease.

TI  - Surgical treatment of complete acromioclavicular dislocations.
PG  - 324-31
AB  - Forty-four patients, ranging in age from 17 to 57 years (average, 32), were 
      evaluated an average of 4 years (range, 2 to 9) after surgical reconstruction for 
      Allman-Tossy Grade III acromioclavicular dislocations. Twenty-seven patients 
      underwent repair for acute injuries (< 3 weeks after injury) and 17 patients 
      underwent reconstructions for chronic injuries (> 3 weeks). Coracoclavicular 
      fixation with heavy nonabsorbable sutures was used to correct superior 
      displacement in all cases. In addition, transfer of the coracoacromial ligament 
      to the distal clavicle was performed in 15 of the 27 early repairs and 17 of the 
      17 late reconstructions. Overall, 26 of 27 (96%) early repairs and 13 of 17 (77%) 
      late reconstructions achieved satisfactory results. There was a trend for better 
      results and return to sports or heavy labor with early repairs; however, this was 
      not statistically significant (P = 0.065). When the results of early repairs were 
      compared with those of late reconstructions performed more than 3 months after 
      injury, the results of the shoulders undergoing early repair were significantly 
      better (P < 0.01). Overall, 39 of 44 (89%) patients achieved a satisfactory 
      result. Surgical reconstruction for acromioclavicular dislocation provides 
      reliable results including use of the arm for sports or repetitive work.

PG  - 629-33
AB  - In this paper the applicability in terms of measurement accuracy of the "Flock of 
      Birds" six D.O.F. electromagnetic tracking device in shoulder research is 
      investigated. Position measurements in a workspace of approximately 1 m3 were 
      performed using a stylus. The andom error at the stylus tip appeared to be 1.86, 
      1.98 and 2.54 mm for x-, y- and z-coordinate, respectively. The error caused by 
      distortion of the magnetic field by metal in the concrete of especially the floor 
      was 20.8, 22.2 and 20.4 mm for the x-, y- and z-coordinate, respectively. 
      Calibration and leaving out the measurements closest to the floor lowered this 
      error to 2.07, 2.38 and 2.35 mm. Orientation errors of the shoulder bones 
      evolving from the measurement inaccuracy were estimated from repeated 
      measurements of shoulder bony landmarks of ten subjects by means of the stylus. 
      These errors were generally below 2 degrees. This is lower than found for the 
      same measurements using a spatial linkage digitizer. It is concluded that the 
      "Flock of Birds" is a useful tool for shoulder kinematic studies.

AB  - Dynamic pattern of Scapulothoracic rhythm during arm abduction in scapular plane 
      is studied using computer-imaging technique. Aim of the study is to produce a 
      reproducible and reliable way of calculating the scapular movement and 
      glenohumeral movement using least possible roentgenographic exposure. Moving 
      X-ray screening picture of the shoulder joint is analysed using video capture 
      computer programme and the images at different degrees of abduction are then 
      analysed for scapular movement using computer aided designer and drafting 
      software. Results were comparable to the authoritative shoulder analysis carried 
      out in the past, the difference of radiation exposure, approximately 10 times 
      less.

TI  - Computed tomography in primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis without humeral head 
      elevation.
PG  - 187-94
AB  - Few studies have evaluated computed tomography in glenohumeral osteoarthritis 
      without humeral head elevation. Two recent studies included only ten and 11 
      patients, respectively. We evaluated computed tomography findings in 113 cases of 
      primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis without humeral head elevation. Glenoid 
      retroversion was substantially increased, with a mean of 16 degrees versus 8 
      degrees in a control group. The method used to measure this parameter was 
      reproducible, with a mean interobserver variability of 4 degrees for a 95% 
      confidence interval (P < or = 0.05). Humeral retrotorsion was apparently 
      decreased (8 degrees), but osteoarthritis-related changes in the humeral head 
      resulted in substantial measurement errors (interobserver variability, 11 degrees 
      for a 95% confidence interval; P < or = 0.05). Humeral head subluxation was found 
      in 35% of cases and measurement of this parameter was reproducible (interobserver 
      variability, 4 degrees for a 95% confidence interval). Changes in the glenoid 
      over time were dependent on the position of the humeral head in the glenoid 
      fossa, which classified the shape of the glenoid with satisfactory 
      reproducibility (intra- and interobserver Kappa, 0.68). The subscapularis and 
      infraspinatus muscles were normal (stage 0 or 1) in 98% and 91% of cases, 
      respectively and the method of Goutallier and Bernageau used for muscle 
      evaluation proved highly reproducible (Kappa, 0.85). Computed tomography is 
      invaluable for planning surgical treatment for primary glenohumeral 
      osteoarthritis without humeral head elevation.

TI  - Anterior acromioplasty for subacromial impingement in patients younger than 40 
      years of age.
PG  - 111-6
AB  - The indications and results of anterior acromioplasty in patients older than 40 
      years of age are well documented; however, little is reported concerning this 
      procedure in younger patients because the majority are treated conservatively. 
      Over the last seven years, 26 patients younger than 40 years of age were treated 
      by anterior acromioplasty for subacromial impingement resistant to conservative 
      therapy. The indication for surgery was failed conservative therapy in 17 
      patients. Six patients had impingement despite previous surgery, such as failed 
      acromioplasty, biceps tenolysis, and biceps tenodesis. Two patients had 
      impingement secondary to greater tuberosity malunion. The average duration of 
      symptoms was 27 months and of conservative therapy, 17 months. All patients had a 
      bursectomy and anterior acromioplasty. In addition, eight had a complete 
      acromioclavicular arthroplasty for concurrent acromioclavicular arthritis, four 
      had a modified acromioclavicular arthroplasty for impingement under the 
      acromioclavicular joint, three had calcium excisions, and one had a rotator cuff 
      repair. The greater tuberosity malunions were advanced in one patient and excised 
      in one. The results were 81% (21) excellent and good, 15% (four) fair, and 4% 
      (one) poor. The average follow-up period was 33 months. The majority of younger 
      patients with subacromial impingement can be successfully treated conservatively. 
      In those patients with persistent symptoms, open acromioplasty can reliably give 
      good results with regard to pain and function.

TI  - Virtual power based algorithm for decoupling large motions from infinitesimal 
      strains: application to shoulder joint biomechanics.
PG  - 387-96
AB  - New trends of numerical models of human joints require more and more computation 
      of both large amplitude joint motions and fine bone stress distribution. 
      Together, these problems are difficult to solve and very CPU time consuming. The 
      goal of this study is to develop a new method to diminish the calculation time 
      for this kind of problems which include calculation of large amplitude motions 
      and infinitesimal strains. Based on the Principle of Virtual Power, the present 
      method decouples the problem into two parts. First, rigid body motion is 
      calculated. The bone micro-deformations are then calculated in a second part by 
      using the results of rigid body motions as boundary conditions. A finite element 
      model of the shoulder was used to test this decoupling technique. The model was 
      designed to determine the influence of humeral head shape on stress distribution 
      in the scapula for different physiological motions of the joint. Two versions of 
      the model were developed: a first version completely deformable and a second 
      version based on the developed decoupling method. It was shown that biomechanical 
      variables, as mean pressure and von Mises stress, calculated with the two 
      versions were sensibly the same. On the other hand, CPU time needed for 
      calculating with the new decoupled technique was more than 6 times less than with 
      the completely deformable model.

AB  - Field and laboratory studies of arm-swinging in gibbons reveal its singularity 
      even compared to spider monkeys. On the basis of principal components and 
      discriminant analyses of size-corrected forelimb variables, this study confirms 
      their morphological uniqueness and the more generalized nature of the spider 
      monkey forelimb. Long forearms, well-developed scapular spines, and sagittally 
      thicker radial shafts are features associated strictly with gibbon arm-swinging. 
      On the other hand, large humeral heads, projecting medial epicondyles, and 
      axially elongated scapulae, traditionally regarded as arm-swinging traits, are 
      probably more important for climbing.

AB  - The abduction in the scapular plane and forward flexion of the arm were studied 
      in ten subjects by electromyography combined with goniometry permitting 
      simultaneous measurement of arm and glenohumeral angles. The "integrated" 
      electromyograms from six should girdle muscles plotted against the arm angle were 
      submitted to variance analysis for pattern discrimination. The progression of 
      electromyographic activities in these muscles was discriminable with errors 
      ranging from 0.0 to 26.3 percent and could be classified in several categories. 
      Their relationship with functional mechanism to the abduction movement was not 
      necessarily constant, but accelerated just before the maximum elevation.

PG  - 139-147
LID - 10.1080/09638288.2020.1760948 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the reliability and discriminative validity of a proposed 
      adapted tool for the assessment of movement control in patients with and without 
      neck pain. METHOD: A cross-sectional study at a University hospital center 
      involving 25 pain-free healthy controls and 25 patients suffering from neck pain. 
      Participants were assessed by two raters for inter-rater reliability and 1 week 
      afterwards by a same rater for intra-rater reliability. The assessment involved a 
      test for the axioscapular (adapted scapular holding test; SHT) and craniocervical 
      (adapted craniocervical flexion test; CCFT) region for which intra-class 
      correlation coefficients (ICCs) were computed to define the reliability. 
      Discriminative validity to distinguish patients from controls was assessed by 
      cross-validated computation of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative 
      likelihood ratios, overall accuracy, and area under the curve. RESULTS: The 
      proposed tool was able to reliably assess sensorimotor impairment in participants 
      at the craniocervical region (ICC(intra) = [0.52-0.82]; ICC(inter) = 
      [0.60-0.85]), left axioscapular region (ICC(intra) = [0.43-0.77]; ICC(inter) = 
      0.71-0.90), and right axioscapular region (ICC(intra) = [0.47-0.79]; ICC(inter) = 
      [0.42-0.77]). Furthermore, the tool yielded a sensitivity of 0.86, a specificity 
      of 0.57, and accuracy of 0.71 (based on cross-validation). CONCLUSION: The 
      proposed tool is able to reliably evaluate patients based on their sensorimotor 
      performance in the craniocervical and axioscapular region.Implications for 
      rehabilitationNeck pain is related to sensorimotor impairment including 
      neuromuscular differences and atypical sensormimotor control 
      strategies.Clinicians should not avoid the challenging task of screening for 
      sensorimotor impairment in patients reporting neck pain.The proposed tool 
      supplemented with other tools might guide clinicians in the evaluation of 
      sensorimotor impairment.

      sequences for the assessment of shoulder pathology.
PG  - 593-601
LID - 10.1007/s00330-021-08183-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the performance of 6-min MRI with a fat-saturated 
      3D-controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration 
      (CAIPIRINHA) Sampling perfection with application-optimized contrast using 
      different flip angle evolution (SPACE) TSE protocol with 10-min 2D TSE MRI 
      protocol for assessment of abnormalities of the shoulder. METHODS: Forty-nine 
      subjects underwent both 3D fat-saturated-CAIPIRINHA SPACE and 2D TSE sequences of 
      the shoulder on a 3.0-T system. Following randomization and anonymization, two 
      musculoskeletal radiologists evaluated the 2D and 3D images independently for 
      image quality and diagnostic capability. Descriptive statistics, inter-observer, 
      and inter-method concordance were investigated. p values < 0.05 were considered 
      significant. RESULTS: For image quality assessment, 2D images were similar to 3D 
      CAIPIRINHA SPACE images (p = 0.05). 3D had lower noise standard deviation (SD) 
      and higher fluid CNR than 2D images (p = 0.00). For diagnostic capability 
      assessment, using 2D TSE as a standard of reference, sensitivity, specificity, 
      and accuracy of 3D SPACE were, respectively, 94.81%, 94.12%, and 94.39% for 
      tendon abnormalities; 97.06%, 80.00%, and 91.84% for acromioclavicular joint 
      abnormalities; 88.89%, 100.00%, and 93.89% for adjacent bone alterations; and 
      97.30%, 100%, and 97.96% for joint fluid/effusion assessment. The inter-method 
      concordance was moderate to almost perfect. The inter-observer-concordance of the 
      shoulder assessment was also moderate to almost perfect, with SSP lesions 
      demonstrating the greatest concordance. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of 6-min 3D 
      fat-saturated-CAIPIRINHA SPACE MRI for shoulder MRI is similar to that of 10-min 
      2D TSE MRI. 3D fat-saturated-CAIPIRINHA SPACE MRI can be utilized to reduce scan 
      time without degradation in image quality. KEY POINTS: • CAIPIRINHA acceleration 
      3D fat-saturated-MRI of the shoulder is achievable in 6 min with high spatial 
      resolution. • 3D fat-saturated CAIPIRINHA MRI is similar to 2D MRI in the 
      shoulder assessment. • 3D CAIPIRINHA MRI images enable rapid diagnosis of 
      shoulder abnormalities without image quality degradation.

TI  - [Endoscopic acromioplasty in total rupture of the rotator cuff].
PG  - 369-78
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The authors have conducted a study to evaluate the possible 
      efficacy of endoscopic decompression without repair in the treatment of rotator 
      cuff tears. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We report 42 cases of endoscopic acromioplasty 
      realized for full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Mean follow-up was 28.8 months. 
      The principal presenting symptom was pain, with a mean duration of 29 months. 
      Antero-external acromioplasty was realized by endoscopy using motorized drill 
      bits, with sectioning or resecting the acromio-coracoid ligament. Revision 
      consisted of a standard clinical examination, following the protocol of Constant, 
      and a radiologic examination by sub-acromial frontal and scapular profile x-rays 
      as advised by Liotard. RESULTS: The functional results were very good, with 94 
      per cent of patients satisfied. The mean Constant score was 67.4 (14-100) 
      corresponding on the average to 84 per cent of the score of a healthy shoulder 
      for the same age and sex. The improvement concerned essentially the score of the 
      pain, which increased on the average 7.4 points out of 15 (10.2/15 at revision) 
      and of the activity level (14.8/20 as opposed to 8/20 initially). Less important 
      was the improvement of the active mobility score (from 25.2 to 34/40 at 
      revision). The force was measured according to the Constant scale, with a mean of 
      8.3 points out of 25. The mean duration of absence from work for the active 
      patients was 2.4 months. Neither infectious nor neurological complications were 
      noted. The radiographic analysis showed a decrease of the acromial edge, 
      significative as compared to the opposite side. On the profile x-ray, we observed 
      48 per cent flat acromions in contrast to 80 per cent curved types on the 
      opposite side. The only element influencing the pain score was the size of the 
      rupture, but the statistical result was weak. The final Constant score was 
      strongly influenced by by the size of the rupture, the active mobility, the 
      pre-operative active and passive mobility, as well as by the presence of head 
      excentration on pre-operative x-rays. DISCUSSION: Comparison with other series of 
      endoscopic acromioplasty for full-thickness rotator cuff tears has permitted us 
      to confirm the validity of our series. We have especially evaluated this series 
      in comparison to those with surgical repair. The subjective results, as well as 
      those for pain, are equivalent; results on active mobility and force were not as 
      good. We propose, therefore, this technique of low morbidity, in the presence of 
      total ruptures in older and sedentary patients. The antalgic effect of endoscopic 
      acromioplasty allows, in these patients, a functionally satisfying 
      rehabilitation.

TI  - Effective glenoid version in professional baseball players.
PG  - 340-4
AB  - The pathomechanics of the throwing shoulder have yet to be fully elucidated. The 
      focus of this study reported here was to further characterize the morphology of 
      the glenoid in a population of elite throwing athletes. We obtained magnetic 
      resonance imaging scans of 38 professional baseball players (dominant shoulders) 
      and of 35 age matched nonthrowing control patients (17 dominant and 18 
      nondominant shoulders). Seven measurements were made by 3 blinded reviewers on 3 
      axial images per patient: version of superior glenoid, middle glenoid, inferior 
      glenoid, superior capsulolabral junction, middle capsulolabral junction, inferior 
      capsulolabral junction, and depth of concavity of glenoid in a middle slice. Mean 
      age of the 38 players (24 pitchers, 14 fielders) was 26.8 years, and mean age of 
      the 35 control patients was 27.6 years. Intraclass correlation coefficients 
      ranged from .55 to .84 for the version measurements. There were no statistically 
      significant differences between the pitchers and the fielders on any of the 7 
      measurements, but such differences were found between the throwers and the 
      dominant-shoulder control patients on all 7 measurements. There were only 2 
      differences (version of superior glenoid, depth of concavity of glenoid in a 
      middle slice) between dominant- and nondominant- shoulder control patients. There 
      was significantly more retroversion in the osseous and soft tissues of the elite 
      throwing athletes than in the nonthrowing control patients. This increased 
      retroversion may play a role in development of internal impingement in the 
      overhead athlete.

TI  - Repetitive pointing to remembered proprioceptive targets improves 3D hand 
      positioning accuracy.
PG  - 184-205
AB  - Repetitive pointing movements to remembered proprioceptive targets were 
      investigated to determine whether dynamic proprioception could be used to modify 
      the initial sensorimotor conditions associated with an active definition of the 
      target position. Twelve blindfolded subjects used proprioception to reproduce a 
      self-selected target position as accurately as possible. Ten repetitions for each 
      limb were completed using overhead and scapular plane pointing tasks. A 3D 
      optical tracking system determined hand trajectory start and endpoint positions 
      for each repetition. These positions quantified three-dimensional pointing errors 
      relative to the target position and the initial and preceding movement 
      repetitions, as well as changes in movement direction and extent. Target position 
      and cumulative start position errors were significantly greater than the 
      corresponding preceding movement (inter-repetition) errors, and increased as the 
      trial progressed. In contrast, hand trajectory start and endpoint 
      inter-repetition errors decreased significantly with repeated task performance, 
      as did movement extent, although it was consistently underestimated for each 
      repetition. Pointing direction remained constant, except for the angle of 
      elevation for scapular plane pointing, which consistently decreased throughout 
      the trial. The results suggest that the initial conditions prescribed by actively 
      defining a proprioceptive target were subsequently modified by dynamic 
      proprioception, such that movement reproduction capability improved with repeated 
      task performance.

TI  - Coracoclavicular stabilization using a suture anchor technique.
PG  - 294-300
AB  - Multiple fixation options exist for coracoclavicular stabilization, but many are 
      technically demanding and require hardware removal. In the study reported here, 
      we reviewed a specific fixation technique that includes suture anchors moored in 
      the base of the coracoid process. We retrospectively reviewed 24 consecutive 
      cases of patients who underwent coracoclavicular stabilization with a suture 
      anchor for a type III or type V acromioclavicular (AC) joint separation or a 
      group II, type II or type V distal clavicle fracture. Eighteen of the 22 patients 
      had full strength and painless range of motion (ROM) in the affected extremity by 
      3 months and at final follow-up (minimum, 24 months; mean, 39 months). Two 
      patients were lost to follow-up. Four patients had early complications likely 
      secondary to documented noncompliance. Two of these 4 patients underwent 
      reoperation with a similar procedure and remained asymptomatic at a minimum 
      follow-up of 15 months. One patient underwent osteophyte and knot excision 7 
      months after surgery and remained asymptomatic at 30 months. Our results suggest 
      that coracoclavicular stabilization using a suture anchor technique is a safe and 
      reliable method of treating acromioclavicular joint separations and certain 
      distal clavicle fractures in the compliant patient.

TI  - An analytical approach to determine the in situ forces in the glenohumeral 
      ligaments.
PG  - 311-5
AB  - The purpose of this study was to use an analytical approach to determine the 
      forces in the glenohumeral ligaments during joint motion. Predictions from the 
      analytical approach were validated by comparing them to experimental data. Using 
      a geometric model, the lengths of the four glenohumeral ligaments were determined 
      during anterior-posterior loading simulations and forward flexion-extension. The 
      corresponding force in each structure was subsequently calculated based on length 
      data via load-elongation curves obtained experimentally. During the anterior 
      loading simulation at 0 deg of abduction, the superior glenohumeral ligament 
      carried up to 71 N at the maximally translated position. At 90 deg of abduction, 
      the anterior band of the inferior glenohumeral ligament had the highest force of 
      45 N during anterior loading. These results correlated well with those found in 
      previous experimental studies. We believe that this validated analytical approach 
      can be used to predict the forces in the glenohumeral ligaments during more 
      complex joint motion as well as assist surgeons during shoulder repair 
      procedures.

AB  - The shoulder is one of the most complex joints of the human body, mainly because 
      of its large range of motion, but also because of its active muscular 
      stabilisation. Actually, the numerous stabilizing muscles and degrees of freedom 
      yield indeterminate biomechanical models. To solve this indeterminate, most 
      models use reverse dynamics with a simplified ball-socket joint, preventing 
      therefore the natural humerus translation. In this paper, an algorithm was 
      specifically developed to solve the indeterminate problem by a feedback control 
      of muscle activation, allowing the natural humerus translation. Abduction was 
      considered in the scapular plane, accounting for the three deltoid parts and the 
      rotator cuff muscles. The major aim of this study was to validate the numerical 
      algorithm, which was here restricted to two-dimensions in order to compare the 
      numerical solution to a known algebraic one. This comparison gave a relative 
      error below 0.1%. The joint reaction force was comparable to other models and the 
      humerus translation was in agreement with in vivo or in vitro studies.

TI  - Determination of subacromial space width and inferior acromial mineralization by 
      3D CT. Preliminary data from patients with unilateral supraspinatus outlet 
      syndrome.
PG  - 329-37
AB  - A reduction of the subacromial space and an increased subacromial pressure have 
      been considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of rotator cuff 
      lesions. The objective of the current study was to develop a CT based method for 
      measuring the acromiohumeral distance and inferior acromial mineralization. In 
      seven patients with unilateral rupture of the rotator cuff and two with 
      impingement syndrome, transverse CT images were obtained at a section thickness 
      of 1 mm with muscular relaxation in a standardized position. The bones were then 
      reconstructed three-dimensionally, and the minimal vertical distance between the 
      acromion and the humerus was determined in three secondary frontal images on both 
      sides. The distribution of mineralization within the inferior surface of the 
      acromion was assessed using CT osteoabsorptiometry. Although the Constant score 
      was significantly reduced in the diseased shoulders, the width of the subacromial 
      space was not routinely lower than on the contralateral side. In seven cases the 
      maximal inferior acromial mineralization was identical in both shoulders, and in 
      two cases it was lower on the affected side. These preliminary data suggest that 
      with muscular relaxation no narrowing of the subacromial space can be detected in 
      secondary frontal CT images, and that a potential increase of subacromial 
      pressure is not high enough to cause a measurable increase in inferior acromial 
      bone density. The method presented makes it possible to investigate the 
      pathogenesis of the supraspinatus outlet syndrome in vivo with greater precision 
      than has so far been possible with conventional radiography.

PG  - 175-81
AB  - A retrospective study of fifty-two patients (48 cases followed up), with 
      Allman-Tossy grade III acromioclavicular separations, who were treated with 
      coracoclavicular reconstruction by Mersilene prosthetic substitute (Mersilene 
      tape with polyester suture, 5 mm wide, 30 cm, Ethicon), was carried out. The 
      average follow up was 38 months, with the longest being 10 years, and the 
      shortest being 8 months. The average age of the patients was 32 years, with a 
      range from 20 to 62 years. Two groups were divided by age. Although the younger 
      age group showed better results than the elder one in pain, range of motion and 
      return to previous occupation or sports, the overall outcome was satisfactory in 
      41 of 48 (86%) followed patients. For the grade III acromioclavicular separation 
      patients, surgical reconstruction with Mersilene looping provides a reliable 
      result including use of the arm for sports or repetitive work.

TI  - Capturing the frame of reference of shoulder muscle forces.
PG  - 237-45
AB  - We have adjusted and validated models of the lines of action of six human 
      shoulder muscles. Compared to other models of the shoulder mechanism (e.g., 9, 
      11, 17, 24) ours is greatly simplified in that the scapula and its many muscles 
      are largely neglected, and the action of each of six broad muscles is summarized 
      by a single line segment. The close correspondence between measured and predicted 
      moment direction over a wide range of postures suggests that this latter 
      simplification was reasonable. We found that assignment of two via points (one 
      fixed to the origin and one fixed to the insertion) was adequate to represent the 
      measured actions, and our sensitivity analysis highlights the importance of via 
      point placement. Because our model predicts the action of each muscle over a very 
      large range of arm postures, it should be useful for future investigations of the 
      control of muscle forces.

TI  - The "arthroscopic impingement test".
PG  - 224-30
AB  - Arthroscopic acromioplasty is an effective technique to treat refractory 
      impingement syndrome of the shoulder; however, it is a technically demanding 
      procedure and failure due to inadequate acromial resection has been reported. The 
      purpose of this study was to describe a more reliable technique of arthroscopic 
      acromioplasty ("arthroscopic impingement test") that allows determination of 
      subacromial space available (SSA) during shoulder flexion after acromioplasty. 
      During a 2-year period, 70 consecutive patients (group I) underwent arthroscopic 
      acromioplasty by a conventional technique and 50 consecutive patients (group II) 
      underwent the modified technique. Both groups were comparable in terms of age, 
      gender, chronicity of symptoms, incidence of workman's compensation cases, side 
      of surgery, and operative findings. In group I, four patients (6%) failed due to 
      inadequate acromioplasty and at time of revision were found to have 0 mm SSA at 
      120 degrees flexion (contact of cuff on acromion). After revision acromioplasty, 
      SSA at 120 degrees flexion was measured as > 3 mm, and impingement symptoms 
      resolved postoperatively. In group II, there were no failures and SSA after 
      initial acromioplasty was found to average 13 mm at 0 degree 10 mm at 45 degrees, 
      8 mm at 90 degrees, and 6 mm at 120 degrees flexion. In four cases, the 
      "arthroscopic impingement test" determined that there was inadequate SSA at 120 
      degrees (< 3 mm) after initial acromioplasty, and these were revised by further 
      acromioplasty at time of surgery. It was concluded that the "arthroscopic 
      impingement test" improves reliability of arthroscopic acromioplasty by verifying 
      adequate acromial resection in a position of impingement.

TI  - Diagnosis of glenoid labral tears using 3-tesla MRI vs. 3-tesla MRA: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 699-709
LID - 10.1007/s00402-018-2894-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Various protocols exist for magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA) of 
      the shoulder, including 3D isotropic scanning and positioning in neutral (2D 
      neutral MRA), or abduction-external-rotation (ABER). HYPOTHESIS: MRA does not 
      improve diagnostic accuracy for labral tears when compared to magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) performed using 3-Tesla (3T) magnets. METHOD: Systematic review of 
      the Cochrane, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases according to PRISMA guidelines. 
      Included studies compared 3T MRI or 3T MRA (index tests) to arthroscopic findings 
      (reference test). Methodological appraisal performed using QUADAS-2. Pooled 
      sensitivity and specificity were calculated. RESULTS: Ten studies including 929 
      patients were included. Index test bias and applicability were a concern in the 
      majority of studies. The use of arthroscopy as the reference test raised concern 
      of verification bias in all studies. For anterior labral lesions, 3T MRI was less 
      sensitive (0.83 vs. 0.87 p = 0.083) than 3T 2D neutral MRA. Compared to 3T 2D 
      neutral MRA, both 3T 3D Isotropic MRA and 3T ABER MRA significantly improved 
      sensitivity (0.87 vs. 0.95 vs. 0.94). For SLAP lesions, 3T 2D neutral MRA was of 
      similar sensitivity to 3T MRI (0.84 vs. 0.83, p = 0.575), but less specific (0.99 
      vs. 0.92 p < 0.0001). For posterior labral lesions, 3T 2D neutral MRA had greater 
      sensitivity than 3T 3D Isotropic MRA and 3T MRI (0.90 vs. 0.83 vs. 0.83). 
      CONCLUSIONS: At 3-T, MRA improved sensitivity for diagnosis of anterior and 
      posterior labral lesions, but reduced specificity in diagnosis of SLAP tears. 3T 
      MRA with ABER positioning further improved sensitivity in diagnosis of anterior 
      labral tears. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.

AB  - Aseptic glenoid component loosening is a common cause of total shoulder 
      arthroplasty (TSA) failure, but early detection is difficult because pain often 
      appears late and radiolucent lines are of uncertain significance. This study 
      sought to answer the following questions: (1) What types of glenoid component 
      motion may be observed during the first 3 years following implantation?; (2) Is 
      the appearance of radiolucent lines around the glenoid component a reliable 
      indicator of component motion?; and (3) Are clinical outcomes correlated with 
      early glenoid component motion within the first 3 years after TSA? Eleven 
      patients (mean age, 60.6 years) underwent TSA using a cemented, all-polyethylene 
      glenoid component with tantalum bead implantation. Clinical outcomes (American 
      Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] score, visual analog scale [VAS] pain score, 
      and range of motion) were compared pre- and postoperatively, and radiolucencies 
      were graded according to the criteria of Lazarus et al. Patients were evaluated 
      using radiostereometric analysis at 6 months and 1, 2, and 3 years 
      postoperatively to measure component micromotion in translation and rotation. At 
      a mean follow-up of 50.2 months, mean ASES score had improved from 30.3 to 81.3 
      (P<.001), mean VAS pain score had improved from 8 to 1 (P<.001), active forward 
      flexion had improved from 109° to 155° (P=.001), active external rotation had 
      improved from 28° to 54° (P=.003), and internal rotation had improved from the 
      level of the sacrum to L3 (P=.002). Radiolucencies were detected around none of 
      the components at 1 year, 6 components at 2 years, and 5 components at 3 years, 
      and these radiolucencies were mostly found around components that experienced 
      high levels of rotational motion.

AB  - Shoulder motion has been mainly analysed in children based on thoraco-humeral 
      (TH) joint kinematics, excluding the scapula-thoracic (ST) and gleno-humeral (GH) 
      joints. In order to measure 3D scapulo-humeral motion using an optoelectronic 
      system, we propose a protocol based on an acromion marker cluster (AMC), a 
      functional method to determine the gleno-humeral rotation centre and different 
      Euler sequences. This study investigated the validity of the AMC compared to the 
      palpation of anatomical landmarks with a scapula locator, assessed the 
      intra-session repeatability and the ability to discriminate differences of such a 
      protocol in 10 typically developing children (TD) and 10 children with hemiplegic 
      cerebral palsy (HCP) during 6 different tasks (flexion, abduction, horizontal 
      abduction, hand to head, hand to controlateral shoulder and hand to back pocket). 
      For both populations, the AMC method showed an overall Root Mean Square Error 
      (RMSE) of 5.5°. The AMC method under-estimated the protraction/retraction of the 
      scapula during abduction. The within-session reliability was good to excellent 
      for all tasks except the hand to back pocket task. The YXY recommended Euler 
      sequence for TH and GH joints resulted in gimbal lock for most of the tasks 
      whereas the XZY sequence could be used for most of the tasks and most of the 
      children.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Levator scapulae (LS) muscle stretching exercises are a common method 
      of lengthening a shortened muscle; however, the appropriate stretching position 
      for lengthening the LS in people with a shortened LS remains unclear. The purpose 
      of this study was to compare the effects of different stretching exercise 
      positions on the LS and introduce effective stretching exercise methods to 
      clinicians. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four university students (12 men, 12 women) with 
      a shortened LS were recruited. METHODS: LS muscle activity, LS index (LSI), and 
      cervical range of motion (ROM) were measured pre (baseline) and post three 
      different stretching exercise positions (sitting, quadruped, and prone). RESULTS: 
      The LSI and cervical ROM exceeded the minimal detectable change and had 
      significant changes. The LSI was greater in the sitting position than at the 
      baseline (p = 0.01), quadruped position (p < 0.01); the LSI in the prone position 
      presented a higher increase than the quadruped position (p = 0.01). The cervical 
      ROM increased in the sitting position when compared to the baseline (p < 0.01) 
      and quadruped position (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Stretching the LS in the sitting 
      position was the most effective exercise for improving LS muscle length and 
      cervical ROM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of only the coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments may 
      restore superior-inferior (S-I) but not anterior-posterior (A-P) stability of the 
      acromioclavicular (AC) joint. Concomitant reconstruction of both the AC and CC 
      ligaments may more reliably restore intact biomechanical characteristics of the 
      AC joint. METHODS: Ten matched pairs of shoulders were utilized. Five specimens 
      underwent CC ligament reconstruction while an equal number underwent combined AC 
      and CC ligament reconstruction utilizing an intramedullary tendon graft. Each of 
      the reconstructions was compared with the intact contralateral control. 
      Translational and load to failure characteristics were compared between groups. 
      RESULTS: No difference was found in S-I translation between intact specimens and 
      CC-only reconstructions (P = .20) nor between intact specimens and AC/CC 
      reconstructions (P = .33) at 10 Newton (N) loads. Significant differences were 
      noted in A-P translation between intact specimens and CC-only reconstructions (P 
      < .001) but no difference in A-P translation between intact specimens and AC/CC 
      reconstructions (P = .34). CONCLUSION: The A-P and S-I translational 
      biomechanical characteristics of the AC joint were restored using the new 
      technique described. Reconstruction of the CC ligaments only (versus AC/CC 
      combined) led to significantly increased translational motion in the A-P plane as 
      compared to intact control specimens.

TI  - Dynamic contact area ratio in shoulder instability: an innovative diagnostic 
      technique measuring interplay of bony lesions.
PG  - 2361-2366
LID - 10.1007/s00167-019-05816-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The hypothesis of this study is that Dynamic Contact Area Ratio of the 
      humerus and glenoid, measured with CT scans, is significantly reduced in patients 
      with anterior shoulder instability compared to the Dynamic Contact Area Ratio in 
      a control group of people without shoulder instability. METHODS: Preoperative CT 
      scans of patients who underwent surgery for anterior shoulder instability were 
      collected. Additionally, the radiologic database was searched for control 
      subjects. Using a validated software tool (Articulis) the CT scans were converted 
      into 3-dimensional models and the amount the joint contact surface during 
      simulated motion was calculated. RESULTS: CT scans of 18 patients and 21 controls 
      were available. The mean Dynamic Contact Area Ratio of patients was 25.2 ± 6.7 
      compared to 30.1 ± 5.1 in healthy subjects (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: Dynamic 
      Contact Area Ratio was significantly lower in patients with anterior shoulder 
      instability compared to controls, confirming the hypothesis of the study. The 
      findings of this study indicate that calculating the Dynamic Contact Area Ratio 
      based on CT scan images may help surgeons in diagnosing anterior shoulder 
      instability. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

TI  - The reliability of hand-held dynamometry in measuring isometric strength of the 
      shoulder internal and external rotator musculature using a stabilization device.
PG  - 119-24
AB  - Although hand-held dynamometry is considered an objective method of measuring 
      strength, the reliability of the procedure can be compromised by inadequate 
      tester strength and insufficient stabilization of the dynamometer and subject. 
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the test-retest reliability of a 
      hand-held dynamometer with the use of a portable stabilization device while 
      testing the shoulder internal and external rotator musculature. The isometric 
      strength of the shoulder rotator musculature was tested twice in 30 asymptomatic 
      adult volunteers (15 male and 15 female) between 18 and 63 years of age by using 
      an intrasession design. Consistency of the testing protocol was maintained 
      through the use of an arm stabilization apparatus, which fixed the arm in 30 
      degrees of the scapular plane and a portable dynamometer stabilization device. 
      Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC's) were high, ranging from ICC (3,1) = 
      0.971-0.972 for the test-retest trials of internal and external rotation. There 
      was no significant difference between sessions one and two for maximum internal 
      rotation (p = 0.431) and maximum external rotation strength (p = 0.780). The 
      results indicate that the testing protocol with stabilization device is a 
      reliable method for measuring strength of the internal and external rotator 
      shoulder musculature.

TI  - Measurement of muscle thickness of the serratus anterior and lower trapezius 
      using ultrasound imaging in competitive recreational adult swimmers, with and 
      without current shoulder pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare serratus anterior and lower trapezius muscle thickness 
      between swimmers with and without current shoulder pain, and between sides when 
      measured by real-time ultrasound imaging. DESIGN: A single blinded age and 
      gender-matched case-control study with 26 symptomatic and 26 asymptomatic 
      recreational swimmers. METHODS: Muscle thickness of serratus anterior and lower 
      trapezius were measured using previously validated real-time ultrasound imaging 
      protocols. Serratus anterior thickness was measured in side lying with 90° of 
      glenohumeral flexion at rest and during a scapular protraction contraction. Lower 
      trapezius thickness was measured in prone with 145° of glenohumeral abduction 
      whilst at rest and when holding the weight of the arm. RESULTS: There was no 
      statistically significant difference between the muscle thickness of serratus 
      anterior and lower trapezius between the symptomatic shoulder and the 
      dominance-matched shoulder in the asymptomatic group of swimmers. There was also 
      no significant difference in muscle thickness between the symptomatic side and 
      asymptomatic side within the symptomatic group. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be 
      no difference in serratus anterior and lower trapezius thickness between swimmers 
      who have mild to moderate shoulder pain, who continue to swim and those who do 
      not have shoulder pain. When imaging the serratus anterior and lower trapezius in 
      swimmers with mild shoulder pain, clinicians should expect no differences between 
      sides. If muscle thickness differences between sides are detected in recreational 
      swimmers, this may indicate that the swimmer is participating in other 
      asymmetrical activities or has a higher level of shoulder pain.

TI  - Evaluation of the Constant score: which is the method to assess the objective 
      strength?
PG  - 403
LID - 10.1186/s12891-019-2795-6 [doi]
LID - 403
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Constant score (CS) is one of the most frequently applied tools 
      for the assessment of the shoulder joint. However, evaluation of strength is not 
      standardized leading to potential bias when comparing different studies. METHODS: 
      Seventy-six patients with fractures of the proximal humerus undergoing open 
      reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) were assessed using standardized CS 
      strength measurements at the deltoid muscle insertion and at the wrist in three 
      different arm positions. Variation coefficients were evaluated for each patient 
      and position. RESULTS: Forty women (57%) and 36 men (43%) were examined 96 months 
      in mean after ORIF. We could state a maximum of 105.3 N difference if 
      measurements were performed at the wrist or the insertion of the deltoid muscle 
      in 90° forward flexion on the injured arm (167.9 ± 83.1 N; 62.6 ± 29.4 N). The 
      lowest variation coefficient of the three performed measurements could be stated 
      at the deltoid muscle insertion in a 90° abduction position in the scapula plane 
      (6.94 ± 5.5). CONCLUSION: Following our study results, different positions of 
      force measurement can change the total CS by a whole category (e.g. "very good" 
      to "good"). We recommend performing the measurement at the insertion of the 
      deltoid muscle in a 90° abduction position in the scapula plane. Otherwise, even 
      in the non-injured, it is hard to reach a "normal" shoulder function, based on 
      the CS. When using the CS as outcome parameter, authors must give detailed 
      information about the force measuring and use an exact measuring device.

LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2015.07.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of the range of axial rotation of the glenohumeral joint 
      will improve understanding of shoulder function, with applications in shoulder 
      rehabilitation and sports medicine. However, there is currently no complete 
      description of motion of the joint. The study aimed to develop a reliable 
      protocol to quantify the internal and external axial rotations of the 
      glenohumeral joint during active and passive motion at multiple humeral 
      positions. METHODS: Optical motion tracking was used to collect kinematic data 
      from 20 healthy subjects. The humerus was positioned at 60°, 90°, and 120° of 
      humerothoracic elevation in the coronal, scapular, and sagittal planes. Internal 
      and external rotations were measured at each position for active and passive 
      motion, where intrasubject standard deviations were used to assess variations in 
      internal-external rotations. RESULTS: The protocol showed intrasubject 
      variability in the axial rotational range of <5° for active and passive rotations 
      at all humeral positions. Maximum internal rotation was shown to be dependent on 
      humeral position, where a reduced range was measured in the sagittal plane (P < 
      .001) and at 120° elevations (P < .001). Conversely, maximum external rotations 
      were not affected by humeral position. CONCLUSION: The results describe normal 
      ranges of internal-external rotation of the glenohumeral joint at multiple 
      humeral positions. The protocol's low variability means that it could be used to 
      test whether shoulder pathologic conditions lead to changes in axial rotational 
      range at specific humeral positions.

TI  - Shoulder joint position sense improves with elevation angle in a novel, 
      unconstrained task.
PG  - 559-68
AB  - Proprioception, encompassing the submodalities of kinesthesia and joint position 
      sense, is important in the maintenance of joint stability, especially in the 
      shoulder. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of plane and 
      elevation angle on unconstrained shoulder joint position sense. Twenty-two 
      subjects (12 male, 10 female) without a history of shoulder pathology were 
      recruited from a university campus. Subjects attempted to replicate, with respect 
      to plane and elevation angles, various target positions. Target positions 
      consisted of five plane angles at 90 degrees of arm elevation and five arm 
      elevation angles in the scapular plane. All target positions were tested twice to 
      assess the reliability of the measurement. Intraclass correlation coefficients 
      were generally low across target positions, possibly owing to the novelty and 
      demanding nature of the task. No differences in repositioning errors were 
      observed between plane angles (p = 0.255). Repositioning errors decreased 
      linearly as the elevation angle increased from 30 degrees to 90 degrees (p = 
      0.007) and increased again from 90 degrees to 110 degrees of elevation (p = 
      0.029). Our results suggest that unconstrained joint position sense may be 
      enhanced with increased muscular activation levels. Further, afferent feedback 
      from musculotendinous mechanoreceptors may dominate over that from 
      capsuloligamentous sources in unconstrained movements.

TI  - Patient Posture Affects Simulated ROM in Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty: A 
      Modeling Study Using Preoperative Planning Software.
PG  - 619-631
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000002003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Component selection and placement in reverse total shoulder 
      arthroplasty (RTSA) is still being debated. Recently, scapulothoracic orientation 
      and posture have emerged as relevant factors when planning an RTSA. However, the 
      degree to which those parameters may influence ROM and whether modifiable 
      elements of implant configuration may be helpful in improving ROM among patients 
      with different postures have not been thoroughly studied, and modeling them may 
      be instructive. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Using a dedicated expansion of a conventional 
      preoperative planning software, we asked: (1) How is patient posture likely to 
      influence simulated ROM after virtual RTSA implantation? (2) Do changes in 
      implant configuration, such as humeral component inclination and retrotorsion, or 
      glenoid component size and centricity improve the simulated ROM after virtual 
      RTSA implantation in patients with different posture types? METHODS: In a 
      computer laboratory study, available whole-torso CT scans of 30 patients (20 
      males and 10 females with a mean age of 65 ± 17 years) were analyzed to determine 
      the posture type (Type A, upright posture, retracted scapulae; Type B, 
      intermediate; Type C, kyphotic posture with protracted scapulae) based on the 
      measured scapula internal rotation as previously described. The measurement of 
      scapular internal rotation, which defines these posture types, was found to have 
      a high intraclass correlation coefficient (0.87) in a previous study, suggesting 
      reliability of the employed classification. Three shoulder surgeons each 
      independently virtually implanted a short, curved, metaphyseal impaction stem 
      RTSA in each patient using three-dimensional (3D) preoperative surgical planning 
      software. Modifications based on the original component positioning were 
      automatically generated, including different humeral component retrotorsion (0°, 
      20°, and 40° of anatomic and scapular internal rotation) and neck-shaft angle 
      (135°, 145°, and 155°) as well as glenoid component configuration (36-mm 
      concentric, 36-mm eccentric, and 42-mm concentric), resulting in 3720 different 
      RTSA configurations. For each configuration, the maximum potential ROM in 
      different planes was determined by the software, and the effect of different 
      posture types was analyzed by comparing subgroups. RESULTS: Irrespective of the 
      RTSA implant configuration, the posture types had a strong effect on the 
      calculated ROM in all planes of motion, except for flexion. In particular, 
      simulated ROM in patients with Type C compared with Type A posture demonstrated 
      inferior adduction (median 5° [interquartile range -7° to 20°] versus 15° [IQR 7° 
      to 22°]; p < 0.01), abduction (63° [IQR 48° to 78°] versus 72° [IQR 63° to 82°]; 
      p < 0.01), extension (4° [IQR -8° to 12°] versus 19° [IQR 8° to 27°]; p < 0.01), 
      and external rotation (7° [IQR -5° to 22°] versus 28° [IQR 13° to 39°]; p < 
      0.01). Lower retrotorsion and a higher neck-shaft angle of the humeral component 
      as well as a small concentric glenosphere resulted in worse overall ROM in 
      patients with Type C posture, with severe restriction of motion in adduction, 
      extension, and external rotation to below 0°. CONCLUSION: Different posture types 
      affect the ROM after simulated RTSA implantation, regardless of implant 
      configuration. An individualized choice of component configuration based on 
      scapulothoracic orientation seems to attenuate the negative effects of posture 
      Type B and C. Future studies on ROM after RTSA should consider patient posture 
      and scapulothoracic orientation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In patients with Type C 
      posture, higher retrotorsion, a lower neck-shaft angle, and a larger or inferior 
      eccentric glenosphere seem to be advantageous.

TI  - A Robotic Glenohumeral Simulator for Investigating Prosthetic Implant 
      Subluxation.
LID - 015001 [pii]
LID - 10.1115/1.4044388 [doi]
AB  - Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is an effective treatment for glenohumeral (GH) 
      osteoarthritis. However, it still suffers from a substantial rate of mechanical 
      failure, which may be related to cyclic off-center loading of the humeral head on 
      the glenoid. In this work, we present the design and evaluation of a GH joint 
      robotic simulator developed to study GH translations. This five-degree-of-freedom 
      robot was designed to replicate the rotations (±40 deg, accuracy 0.5 deg) and 
      three-dimensional (3D) forces (up to 2 kN, with a 1% error settling time of 
      0.6 s) that the humeral implant exerts on the glenoid implant. We tested the 
      performances of the simulator using force patterns measured in real patients. 
      Moreover, we evaluated the effect of different orientations of the glenoid 
      implant on joint stability. When simulating realistic dynamic forces and implant 
      orientations, the simulator was able to reproduce stable behavior by measuring 
      the translations of the humeral head of less than 24 mm with respect to the 
      glenoid implant. Simulation with quasi-static forces showed dislocation in 
      extreme ranges of implant orientation. The robotic GH simulator presented here 
      was able to reproduce physiological GH forces and may therefore be used to 
      further evaluate the effects of glenoid implant design and orientation on joint 
      stability.

TI  - Precision of shoulder anatomical landmark calibration by two approaches: a 
      CAST-like protocol and a new anatomical palpator method.
PG  - 587-91
LID - 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2008.12.013 [doi]
AB  - The objective of the study was to compare the precision of shoulder anatomical 
      landmark palpation using a CAST-like method and a newly developed anatomical 
      palpator device (called A-Palp) using the forefinger pulp directly. The 
      repeated-measures experimental design included four examiners that twice repeated 
      measurements on eleven scapula and humerus anatomical landmarks during two 
      sessions. Inter-session and inter-examiner precision was determined on 
      volunteers. A-Palp accuracy was obtained from in vitro measurements and using 
      virtual palpation on 3D bone models. Error propagation on the motion 
      representation was also analyzed for a continuous motion of abduction movement 
      performed in the shoulder joint. Palpation results showed that CAST and A-Palp 
      methods lead to similar precision with the Maximal A-Palp calibration error being 
      1.5mm. In vivo precision of the CAST and A-Palp methods varied between 4mm 
      (inter-session) and 8mm (inter-examiner). Mean propagation of the palpation error 
      on the motion graph representation was 2 degrees and 5 degrees for scapula and 
      humerus, respectively. A-Palp accuracy was 3.6 and 8.1mm for scapula and humerus, 
      respectively. The A-Palp seems promising and could probably become an additional 
      method next to today's marker-based motion analysis systems (i.e., Helen-Hayes 
      configuration, CAST method).

TI  - Optimal normalization tests for shoulder muscle activation: an electromyographic 
      study.
PG  - 647-53
AB  - To accurately compare electromyographic data from different muscles and different 
      subjects, it is necessary to normalize the integrated data obtained from each 
      muscle. The purpose of this study was to identify the manual muscle testing 
      positions that elicit maximal neural activation (integrated electromyography) of 
      three rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis) and 
      five shoulder synergists (pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and anterior, 
      middle, and posterior deltoids). The electromyographic activity of these eight 
      muscles was examined in the nondominant shoulders of nine subjects. Indwelling 
      wire electrodes (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis) and surface 
      adhesive electrodes (pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and anterior, middle, 
      and posterior deltoids) were placed. Each subject performed a series of 27 
      isometric contractions, and optimal tests (maximal neural activation) were 
      identified for each muscle. Four tests were identified that resulted in the 
      maximal neural activation of all eight shoulder muscles: 90 degrees of scapular 
      elevation with -45 degrees of humeral rotation for the supraspinatus, anterior 
      deltoid, and middle deltoid: external rotation at 90 degrees of scapular 
      elevation and -45 degrees of humeral rotation for the infraspinatus and posterior 
      deltoid: internal rotation at 90 degrees of scapular elevation and neutral 
      humeral rotation for the subscapularis and latissimus dorsi: and internal 
      rotation at 0 degree of elevation and neutral rotation for the pectoralis major. 
      These results identify four standard testing positions that will provide 
      reference values for normalization of maximal voluntary contraction for the eight 
      muscles of the shoulder examined in this study. Standardization of these test 
      positions offers normalization guidelines that can be used in future dynamic 
      electromyography studies of the shoulder.

TI  - Surface electromyographic analysis of exercises for the trapezius and serratus 
      anterior muscles.
PG  - 247-58
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This study used a prospective, single-group repeated-measures 
      design to analyze differences between the electromyographic (EMG) amplitudes 
      produced by exercises for the trapezius and serratus anterior muscles. OBJECTIVE: 
      To identify high-intensity exercises that elicit the greatest level of EMG 
      activity in the trapezius and serratus anterior muscles. BACKGROUND: The 
      trapezius and serratus anterior muscles are considered to be the only upward 
      rotators of the scapula and are important for normal shoulder function. 
      Electromyographic studies have been performed for these muscles during active and 
      low-intensity exercises, but they have not been analyzed during high intensity 
      exercises. METHODS AND MEASURES: Surface electrodes recorded EMG activity of the 
      upper, middle, and lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles during 10 
      exercises in 30 healthy subjects. RESULTS: The unilateral shoulder shrug exercise 
      was found to produce the greatest EMG activity in the upper trapezius. For the 
      middle trapezius, the greatest EMG amplitudes were generated with 2 exercises: 
      shoulder horizontal extension with external rotation and the overhead arm raise 
      in line with the lower trapezius muscle in the prone position. The arm raise 
      overhead exercise in the prone position produced the maximum EMG activity in the 
      lower trapezius. The serratus anterior was activated maximally with exercises 
      requiring a great amount of upward rotation of the scapula. The exercises were 
      shoulder abduction in the plane of the scapula above 120 degrees and a diagonal 
      exercise with a combination of shoulder flexion, horizontal flexion, and external 
      rotation. CONCLUSION: This study identified exercises that maximally activate the 
      trapezius and serratus anterior muscles. This information may be helpful for 
      clinicians in developing exercise programs for these muscles.

TI  - Aseptic Glenoid Baseplate Loosening After Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty: A 
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e7
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.RVW.18.00132 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening can lead to the failure of 
      reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). Estimates of the prevalence of 
      aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening after RTSA are required to guide clinical 
      decisions, but published results are variable and lack precision. The goal of 
      this meta-analysis was to determine a precise estimate of the prevalence of 
      aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening after RTSA and to explore variation in the 
      prevalence according to different variables, such as the type of procedure 
      (primary or revision), preoperative diagnosis, the center of rotation of the 
      glenoid component (medialized or lateralized), study size, the definition of 
      aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening, and the duration of follow-up. METHODS: The 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
      guidelines were followed. We searched the MEDLINE and Embase databases for 
      English-language articles describing the outcomes after RTSA with a minimum 
      12-month follow-up in which radiographic findings of aseptic glenoid baseplate 
      loosening were reported. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and 
      meta-regression was used to explore the influence of variables on heterogeneity. 
      Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: One hundred 
      and three studies (covering 6,583 RTSAs) performed from 1991 to 2015 met our 
      inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of radiographic aseptic glenoid 
      baseplate loosening for all RTSAs was 1.16% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80% 
      to 1.69%). The prevalence of aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening was lower among 
      primary RTSAs (0.90%; 95% CI, 0.54% to 1.49%) than among revision RTSAs (3.64%; 
      95% CI, 1.91% to 6.84%). The pooled prevalence of aseptic glenoid baseplate 
      loosening by diagnosis was 2.69% for osteoarthritis with bone loss, 1.71% for 
      cuff tear arthropathy, 1.20% for rheumatoid arthritis, 1.08% for sequelae of 
      fracture, 0.94% for irreparable massive cuff tear, and 0.25% for acute proximal 
      humeral fracture. The prevalence of aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening was not 
      significantly different for prostheses with a medialized center of rotation 
      (1.15%) versus a lateralized center of rotation (1.84%). CONCLUSIONS: To our 
      knowledge, the present study represents the first meta-analysis investigating 
      only aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening after RTSA. Multiple variables were 
      found to be associated with the prevalence of aseptic glenoid baseplate 
      loosening. The rates reported here are lower than those reported previously 
      because of the inclusion of more recent evidence and more studies that evaluated 
      aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV. See 
      Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - Rotator cuff tear pain and tear size and scapulohumeral rhythm.
PG  - 148-59
LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-44.2.148 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The body of knowledge concerning shoulder kinematics in patients with 
      rotator cuff tears is increasing. However, the level of understanding regarding 
      how pain and tear size affect these kinematic patterns is minimal. OBJECTIVE: To 
      identify relationships between pain associated with a full-thickness rotator cuff 
      tear, tear size, and scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) and to determine whether pain 
      and tear size serve as predictors of SHR. DESIGN: A test-retest design was used 
      to quantify pain and SHR before and after a subacromial lidocaine injection. 
      Correlation and multivariate analyses were used to identify relationships among 
      pain, tear size, and SHR. SETTING: Orthopaedic biomechanics research laboratory. 
      PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen patients (age range, 40-75 years) with 
      diagnosed full-thickness rotator cuff tears participated. They were experiencing 
      pain at the time of testing. INTERVENTION(S): Shoulder kinematic data were 
      collected with an electromagnetic tracking system before and after the patient 
      received a lidocaine injection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Pain was rated using a 
      visual analog scale. Three-dimensional scapular kinematics and glenohumeral 
      elevation were assessed. Scapular kinematics included anterior-posterior tilt, 
      medial-lateral tilt, and upward-downward rotation. A regression model was used to 
      calculate SHR (scapular kinematics to glenohumeral elevation) for phases of 
      humeral elevation and lowering. RESULTS: Linear relationships were identified 
      between initial pain scores and SHR and between tear size and SHR, representing 
      an increased reliance on scapular motion with increasing pain and tear size. Pain 
      was identified as an independent predictor of SHR, whereas significant findings 
      for the effect of tear size on SHR and the interaction between pain and tear size 
      were limited. CONCLUSIONS: We noted an increased reliance on scapular 
      contributions to overall humeral elevation with increasing levels of pain and 
      rotator cuff tear size. Pain associated with a rotator cuff tear serves as a 
      primary contributor to the kinematic patterns exhibited in patients with rotator 
      cuff tears.

PG  - 685-94
LID - 10.1016/j.jelekin.2007.11.014 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the intra and interday 
      reliability of surface electromyographic amplitude values of the scapular girdle 
      muscles and upper limbs during 3 isometric closed kinetic chain exercises, 
      involving upper limbs with the fixed distal segment extremity on stable base of 
      support and on a Swiss ball (relatively unstable). Twenty healthy adults 
      performed the exercises push-up, bench-press and wall-press with different effort 
      levels (80% and 100% maximal load). Subjects performed three maximal voluntary 
      contractions (MVC) in muscular testing position of each muscle to obtain a 
      reference value for root mean square (RMS) normalization. Individuals were 
      instructed to randomly perform three isometric contraction series, in which each 
      exercise lasted 6 s with a 2-min resting-period between series and exercises. 
      Intra and interday reliabilities were calculated through the intraclass 
      correlation coefficient (ICC 2.1), standard error of the measurement (SEM). 
      Results indicated an excellent intraday reliability of electromyographic 
      amplitude values (ICC > or = 0.75). The interday reliability of normalized RMS 
      values ranged between good and excellent (ICC 0.52-0.98). Finally, it is 
      suggested that the reliability of normalized electromyographic amplitude values 
      of the analyzed muscles present better values during exercises on a stable 
      surface. However, load levels used during the exercises do not seem to have any 
      influence on variability levels, possibly because the loads were quite similar.

TI  - Latarjet reconstruction in patients with anterior shoulder instability and 
      significant Hill-Sachs lesion.
PG  - 421-427
AB  - Management of glenohumeral instability with large Hill-Sachs lesions remains 
      controversial either to address or just grafting the glenoid rim defects. This 
      study was done to investigate if open Latarjet is sufficient to prevent recurrent 
      instability in patients with significant Hill-Sachs defects without addressing 
      these lesions. In the period between October 2009 and November 2014 twenty three 
      patients with shoulder instability and significant bone loss were treated by open 
      Latarjet. All patients were followed up for a period ranged from 17 to 58 months 
      (median ± SD : 30 ± 13.9).The mean preoperative Rowe score was significantly 
      increased from 45.4 to 91.5 (p value <0,001). At the final follow up there was 17 
      patients with excellent result, 5 patients with good result and 2 patients with 
      fair result. In conclusion, Latarjet provides a reliable and effective 
      stabilization for anteroinferior glenohumeral instability with significant bone 
      loss and engaging Hill-Sachs lesion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Improvement in internal rotation (IR) is not reliably achieved after 
      reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). The purpose of this study was to 
      evaluate the relationship between postoperative IR and glenoid-sided 
      lateralization following RSA in an implant using metallic lateralization. 
      METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study of RSAs with minimum 1-year clinical 
      follow-up was performed. Patients were stratified based on the amount of 
      glenoid-sided implant lateralization into 4 groups: 0-2 mm (n = 57), 4 mm (n 
      =238), 6 mm (n = 95), and 8 mm (n = 65). The primary study outcome was active IR 
      at a minimum of 1 year postoperatively, measured both by spinal level and in 
      degrees with the shoulder abducted to 90°. Secondary outcomes were active forward 
      flexion and external rotation, belly press strength, and subjective 
      patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Comparisons were made with 1-way 
      analyses of variance. Linear regression analyses evaluating for the association 
      of glenoid lateralization with active IR were also performed to control for 
      additional confounders, including demographics and other implant variables such 
      as glenosphere diameter, humeral lateralization, humeral version, and whether the 
      subscapularis was repaired. RESULTS: A total of 455 patients were included in the 
      study. The mean age was 69 years, and 48% of patients were male. IR differences 
      varied by the method of measurement (spinal level vs. IR in degrees with arm 
      abducted). Overall, patients with 8 mm of glenoid lateralization had 
      significantly improved IR compared with all other lateralization groups. Patients 
      with 6 mm of glenoid lateralization had significantly improved IR compared with 
      the 0-2- and 4-mm groups. There were no significant differences in the secondary 
      outcomes or PROs between lateralization groups. In the regression analysis, 
      glenoid lateralization was the only implant-related variable that was 
      significantly associated with improved IR for both measurement methods. 
      Glenosphere diameter and humeral version were both significantly associated with 
      IR measured in degrees with the arm abducted but not spinal level. CONCLUSIONS: 
      For the studied implant system, glenoid lateralization of 6-8 mm was associated 
      with improved active IR at 1 year compared to patients with less glenoid 
      lateralization with no significant differences in active forward flexion, 
      external rotation, or PROs. In a multivariable analysis, increased humeral 
      retroversion was associated with increased IR at 90° and increasing glenosphere 
      diameter was associated with decreased IR at 90°, whereas BMI, subscapularis 
      repair, and humeral lateralization did not significantly affect active IR.

AB  - ➤: Muscle tendon transfers (MTTs) are effective surgical procedures for reducing 
      pain and for improving active shoulder range of motion and patient-reported 
      outcomes for a wide range of pathologies, including serratus anterior and 
      trapezius muscle palsy, irreparable subscapularis tears, irreparable 
      posterosuperior rotator cuff tears, irreparable posterior rotator cuff tears in 
      the setting of reverse shoulder arthroplasty, and symptomatic complete deltoid 
      deficiency. ➤: The principles of MTT include ensuring that the transferred muscle 
      is expendable, the muscle tendon unit has similar excursion, the line of pull of 
      the transferred tendon and of the recipient muscle are similar in terms of 
      biomechanical force, and the transferred muscle should replace at least 1 grade 
      of strength of the deficient recipient muscle. ➤: When MTT procedures are 
      considered, patients must have exhausted all nonoperative management, have 
      preserved passive range of motion, and have an understanding of the postoperative 
      expectations and potential complications. ➤: For patients with scapulothoracic 
      abnormal motion (STAM) due to long thoracic nerve palsy, the indirect or direct 
      pectoralis major tendon transfer is an effective procedure for reducing pain and 
      improving active forward elevation. For patients with STAM due to spinal 
      accessory nerve palsy, the Eden-Lange or the triple tendon transfer procedures 
      reduce pain and improve active forward elevation and abduction as well as 
      patient-reported clinical outcomes. ➤: Both pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi 
      transfer procedures for isolated irreparable subscapularis deficiency without 
      anterosuperior humeral head escape result in improvement with respect to pain, 
      patient-reported outcomes, and forward elevation, with the pectoralis major 
      tendon transfer demonstrating durable long-term outcomes. ➤: The latissimus dorsi 
      or lower trapezius tendon transfer procedures for irreparable posterosuperior 
      rotator cuff tears reliably improve patient-reported outcomes, forward elevation, 
      abduction, and external rotation range of motion. Additionally, latissimus dorsi 
      transfer with or without teres major transfer can be used to restore active 
      external rotation, both in the native shoulder and in the setting of reverse 
      shoulder arthroplasty. ➤: The complications of MTTs include infection, hematoma, 
      and failure of tendon transfer healing; therefore, it is recommended that these 
      complex procedures be performed by shoulder surgeons with appropriate training.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing stiffness in the upper trapezius muscle may contribute to 
      imbalance of scapular motion, and result in shoulder and neck discomfort during 
      shoulder flexion. Therefore, it is essential to quantify upper trapezius 
      stiffness in various shoulder positions in order to aid in the prevention of 
      these disorders and to optimize rehabilitation. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the 
      present study were to examine the intra and inter-tester reliability of MyotonPRO 
      device in measuring upper trapezius stiffness and its ability to determine 
      changes in stiffness during shoulder flexion. METHODS: Twenty healthy male 
      subjects (mean age: 28.3±4.8 years) were studied. The stiffness of upper 
      trapezius was quantified using the MyotonPRO device. RESULTS: The results 
      revealed excellent intra and inter-tester reliability for measuring upper 
      trapezius stiffness with the shoulder in a neutral position, and also found a 
      14.2% increase in stiffness upon shoulder flexion between 0° and 60° of flexion. 
      Minimal detectable change (MDC) was 26.3 N/m. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate 
      that MyotonPRO device is a feasible tool to quantify upper trapezius stiffness as 
      well as changes in muscle stiffness. Thus, it is important to assess the changes 
      in upper trapezius muscle stiffness due to pathology or treatments for future 
      studies.

TI  - Arthroscopic Bankart-Bristow-Latarjet procedure: the development and early 
      results of a safe and reproducible technique.
PG  - 1434-50
LID - 10.1016/j.arthro.2010.07.011 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the reproducibility and safety of a novel arthroscopic 
      technique combining a Bristow-Latarjet procedure with a Bankart repair and to 
      report the early clinical and radiologic results. METHODS: Forty-seven 
      consecutive patients with glenoid bone loss and capsular deficiency were treated 
      with this all-arthroscopic technique; six patients had a failed arthroscopic 
      capsulolabral repair. The coracoid fragment was osteotomized, passed with the 
      conjoined tendon through the subscapularis muscle, and fixed in the standing 
      position with a cannulated screw on the abraded glenoid neck. The capsule and 
      labrum were then reattached on the glenoid rim, leaving the coracoid bone block 
      in an extra-articular position. Potential intraoperative and postoperative 
      complications were recorded. All patients were reviewed and had postoperative 
      radiographs; 35 had computed tomography scans. RESULTS: The procedure was 
      performed entirely arthroscopically in 41 of 47 patients (88%); a conversion to 
      open surgery was needed in 6 patients (12%). The axillary nerve was identified in 
      all cases, and no neurologic injuries were observed. No patient had any 
      recurrence of instability at the most recent follow-up (mean, 16 months). The 
      mean Rowe score was 88 ± 16.7, and the mean Walch-Duplay score was 87.6 ± 12.9. 
      The Subjective Shoulder Value was 87.5% ± 12.7%. The bone block was subequatorial 
      in 98% of the cases (46 of 47) and flush to the glenoid surface in 92% (43 of 
      47); it was too lateral in 1 (2%) and too medial (>5 mm) in 3 (6%). There was 1 
      bone block fracture and 7 migrations. CONCLUSIONS: The arthroscopic 
      Bristow-Latarjet-Bankart procedure is reproducible and safe. This procedure 
      allows restoration of shoulder stability in patients with glenoid bone loss and 
      capsular deficiency, as well as in the case of failed capsulolabral repair. 
      Arthroscopy offers the advantage of providing adequate visualization of both the 
      glenohumeral joint and the anterior neck of the scapula, allowing accurate 
      placement of the bone block and screw. Surgeons should be aware that the 
      procedure is technically difficult and potentially dangerous because of the 
      proximity of the brachial plexus and axillary vessels. Training on cadaveric 
      specimens and transition from open to mini-open and, finally, to all arthroscopic 
      is recommended. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical outcome and 
      radiographic findings after arthroscopic superior capsule reconstruction (ASCR) 
      for symptomatic irreparable rotator cuff tears. METHODS: From 2007 to 2009, 
      24 shoulders in 23 consecutive patients (mean, 65.1 years) with irreparable 
      rotator cuff tears (11 large, 13 massive) underwent ASCR using fascia lata. We 
      used suture anchors to attach the graft medially to the glenoid superior tubercle 
      and laterally to the greater tuberosity. We added side-to-side sutures between 
      the graft and infraspinatus tendon and between the graft and residual anterior 
      supraspinatus/subscapularis tendon to improve force coupling. Physical 
      examination, radiography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed 
      before surgery; at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery; and yearly thereafter. 
      Average follow-up was 34.1 months (24 to 51 months) after surgery. RESULTS: Mean 
      active elevation increased significantly from 84° to 148° (P < .001) and external 
      rotation increased from 26° to 40° (P < .01). Acromiohumeral distance (AHD) 
      increased from 4.6 ± 2.2 mm preoperatively to 8.7 ± 2.6 mm postoperatively (P < 
      .0001). There were no cases of progression of osteoarthritis or rotator cuff 
      muscle atrophy. Twenty patients (83.3%) had no graft tear or tendon retear during 
      follow-up (24 to 51 months). The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) 
      score improved from 23.5 to 92.9 points (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: ASCR restored 
      superior glenohumeral stability and function of the shoulder joint with 
      irreparable rotator cuff tears. Our results suggest that this reconstruction 
      technique is a reliable and useful alternative treatment for irreparable rotator 
      cuff tears. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Ambulatory measurement of shoulder and elbow kinematics through inertial and 
      magnetic sensors.
PG  - 169-78
AB  - Inertial and magnetic measurement systems (IMMSs) are a new generation of motion 
      analysis systems which may diffuse the measurement of upper-limb kinematics to 
      ambulatory settings. Based on the MT9B IMMS (Xsens Technologies, NL), we 
      therefore developed a protocol that measures the scapulothoracic, humerothoracic 
      and elbow 3D kinematics. To preliminarily evaluate the protocol, a 23-year-old 
      subject performed six tasks involving shoulder and elbow single-joint-angle 
      movements. Criteria for protocol validity were limited cross-talk with the other 
      joint-angles during each task; scapulohumeral-rhythm close to literature results; 
      and constant carrying-angle. To assess the accuracy of the MT9B when measuring 
      the upper-limb kinematics through the protocol, we compared the MT9B estimations 
      during the six tasks, plus other four, with the estimations of an optoelectronic 
      system (the gold standard), in terms of RMS error, correlation coefficient (r), 
      and the amplitude ratio (m). Results indicate that the criteria for protocol 
      validity were met for all tasks. For the joint angles mainly involved in each 
      movement, the MT9B estimations presented RMS errors <3.6 degrees , r > 0.99 and 
      0.9 < m < 1.09. It appears therefore that (1) the protocol in combination with 
      the MT9B is valid for, and (2) the MT9B in combination with the protocol is 
      accurate when, measuring shoulder and elbow kinematics, during the tasks tested, 
      in ambulatory settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Restoring shoulder mobility, stability, and strength is a key goal in 
      patients with brachial plexus injuries. Shoulder arthrodesis is chiefly used as 
      an adjunct to, or after failure of, initial direct nerve surgery. The objective 
      of this study was to compare clinical and functional shoulder outcomes after 
      direct nerve transfer vs. shoulder arthrodesis in adults with supra-clavicular 
      brachial plexus injuries. HYPOTHESIS: Shoulder arthrodesis, currently used as a 
      salvage procedure in brachial palsy injuries, deserves to be viewed to a valid 
      alternative to direct nerve transfer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study 
      was conducted in 58 patients with a follow-up of at least 2 years. Among them, 20 
      were managed by transfer of a spinal accessory nerve fascicle to the 
      supra-scapular nerve and 38 by shoulder arthrodesis. Outcome measures were 
      shoulder range-of-motion, isometric shoulder strength, and the Disabilities of 
      the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score. RESULTS: Mean age at surgery was 24 
      years and mean follow-up was 46 months (range, 24-156 months). Motion ranges of 
      the shoulder were not significantly different between the two treatment groups. 
      Data variance was significantly greater in the nerve transfer group than in the 
      shoulder arthrodesis group for scapular antepulsion (p=0.0011), abduction 
      (p<0.001), and external rotation (p=0.0066). Strength was significantly greater 
      in the arthrodesis group in all directions of motion. The DASH scores showed no 
      significant between-group differences. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study 
      conflict with the widely help opinion that nerve transfer to the supra-scapularis 
      nerve produces better clinical outcomes compared to shoulder arthrodesis. Nerve 
      transfer was not better than shoulder arthrodesis in our patients. The data 
      variance heterogeneity suggests poor predictability and reliability of nerve 
      transfer, in contrast to the modest but predictable and uniform results of 
      shoulder arthrodesis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV, retrospective observational 
      comparative study.

AB  - Pain and tenderness of the upper trapezius are the major complaints among people 
      with chronic neck and shoulder disorders. Hyper-activation and increased muscle 
      tension of the upper trapezius during arm elevation will cause imbalance of the 
      scapular muscle force and contribute to neck and shoulder disorders. Assessing 
      the elasticity of the upper trapezius in different arm positions is therefore 
      important for identifying people at risk so as to give preventive programmes or 
      for monitoring the effectiveness of the intervention programmes for these 
      disorders. This study aimed to establish the reliability of supersonic shear 
      imaging (SSI) in quantifying upper trapezius elasticity/shear elastic modulus and 
      its ability to measure the modulation of muscle elasticity during arm elevation. 
      Twenty-eight healthy adults (15 males, 13 females; mean age = 29.6 years) were 
      recruited to participate in the study. In each participant, the shear elastic 
      modulus of the upper trapezius while the arm was at rest and at 30° abduction was 
      measured by two operators and twice by operator 1 with a time interval between 
      the measurements. The results showed excellent within- and between-session 
      intra-operator (ICC = 0.87-0.97) and inter-observer (ICC = 0.78-0.83) reliability 
      for the upper trapezius elasticity with the arm at rest and at 30° abduction. An 
      increase of 55.23% of shear elastic modulus from resting to 30° abduction was 
      observed. Our findings demonstrate the possibilities for using SSI to quantify 
      muscle elasticity and its potential role in delineating the modulation of upper 
      trapezius elasticity, which is essential for future studies to compare the 
      differences in shear elastic modulus between normal elasticity and that of 
      individuals with neck and shoulder disorders.

      separations].
PG  - 228-36
LID - 10.1007/s00064-013-0276-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The surgical procedure aims at anatomic reduction and stabilization of 
      the acromioclavicular joint in vertical and horizontal planes for acute 
      separations using a trans-clavicular and trans-coracoidal suture tape fixation 
      with additional acromioclavicular joint augmentation with a PDS cord cerclage. 
      For chronic instability adding a tendon graft is essential for sustainable 
      stability. INDICATIONS: Acute und chronic acromioclavicular joint separations 
      type Rockwood III-VI. Recurrent AC-joint instability with intact coracoid process 
      (with tendon graft). CONTRAINDICATIONS: Acromioclavicular joint separations type 
      Rockwood I-II. Asymptomatic chronic AC-separations type Rockwood III-IV. Fracture 
      close to base of coracoid process General contraindications for (elective) 
      surgery. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Vertical reconstruction of the coraco-clavicular 
      ligaments using a drill-guide for trans-clavicular and trans-coracoidal tunnel 
      placement for high-strength suture tapes over titanium buttons. Additional 
      stabilization of the AC-joint with a transosseus figure of 8 PDS suture cord 
      cerclage. POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Postoperatively the arm is put in a regular 
      sling for 6 weeks. Free active range of motion of wrist and elbow. Shoulder range 
      of motion is limited to 30° of flexion and abduction and 80° internal and 0° 
      external rotation for 2 weeks. Extended to active-assisted 45° flexion and 
      abduction in weeks 3 and 4 and advanced to 60° flexion/abduction and free 
      internal/external rotation in weeks 5 and 6. Range of motion is unlimited from 
      week 7. Full daily life activities after 3 months, high-impact sports after 5-6 
      months postoperatively. RESULTS: The presented surgical technique reliably 
      stabilizes the acromioclavicular joint. It's biomechanical properties with only 
      the single-tunnel coracoclavicular suture tapes is on the level of the native 
      vertical stability, which can be additionally improved for better horizontal 
      stability with the cerclage over the AC-joint.

TI  - The scapuloacromial angle: a 3D analysis of acromial slope and its relationship 
      with shoulder impingement.
PG  - 1371-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To quantify acromial slope (the scapuloacromial [SA] angle). MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: We used shoulder MR studies in 64 subjects who were stratified 
      surgically into impingement (with and without tear) and nonimpingement (shoulder 
      instability) groups. We measure, in three dimensions, the angle between unit 
      normal vectors to planes of best fit to the undersurface of the acromion and the 
      medial surface of the blade of the scapula. We examine the projection of this SA 
      angle onto the transverse, coronal, and sagittal planes to gauge some measure of 
      rotation, lateral tilt, and anterior tilt with respect to the patient. 
      Orientation of the acromion and scapular blade in relation to the MR scanner and 
      therefore to the patient was also calculated. RESULTS: We found no significant 
      differences between these two groups when examining age and side of pathology. A 
      statistically significant difference was seen between males and females. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study does not support the idea that a flatter acromial slope 
      causes impingement and is an etiological basis for rotator cuff tears. We believe 
      that acromial slope, regardless of imaging plane, is not useful in classifying 
      patients who present with shoulder pain and should not be considered as a source 
      of pathologic changes.

TI  - Activation and tremor of the shoulder muscles to the demands of an archery task.
PG  - 415-21
LID - 10.1080/02640410903536434 [doi]
AB  - Physiological tremor and strength during the maintenance of shoulder position 
      occur during a precision aiming task, such as archery. It is unclear how 
      positions for precision demands affect physiological tremor and associated 
      muscular activities. The purpose of this study was to assess the tremor amplitude 
      and muscular activities of the shoulder between the various positions for 
      precision demands. Ten males (age 21.9 +/- 2.0 years) participated in the study. 
      Electromyography (EMG) was quantified on eight humeral/scapular muscles. The 
      tremor was measured by the acceleration component of a motion tracking sensor in 
      the 3-7 Hz and 8-12 Hz frequency bands. Participants simulated six preparatory 
      archery shooting positions (3 arm angles x 2 arm draw positions) and performed 
      isometric contractions. The relative root mean square (RMS) amplitudes of the 
      shoulder muscles were significantly greater for the full drawing position 
      compared with the partial position (humeral muscles: P = 0.011; scapular muscles: 
      P = 0.026). In the full drawing position, increased humeral/scapular muscle EMG 
      amplitude was moderately associated with an increased power spectrum of 8-12/3-7 
      Hz tremor in humerus/scapula motion (R = 0.43-0.57). To minimize fluctuations in 
      high strength muscle performance, 90 degrees of elevation in the full drawing 
      position may be a suitable position for demands in archery. In addition, scapular 
      muscle amplitude is important for stability to reduce humerus tremor during 
      archery performance.

TI  - Upper limb kinematics after cervical spinal cord injury: a review.
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1186/1743-0003-12-9 [doi]
LID - 9
AB  - Although a number of upper limb kinematic studies have been conducted, no review 
      actually addresses the key-features of open-chain upper limb movements after 
      cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). The aim of this literature review is to 
      provide a clear understanding of motor control and kinematic changes during 
      open-chain upper limb reaching, reach-to-grasp, overhead movements, and fast 
      elbow flexion movements after tetraplegia. Using data from MEDLINE between 1966 
      and December 2014, we examined temporal and spatial kinematic measures and when 
      available electromyographic recordings. We included fifteen control case and 
      three series case studies with a total of 164 SCI participants and 131 healthy 
      control participants. SCI participants efficiently performed a broad range of 
      tasks with their upper limb and movements were planned and executed with strong 
      kinematic invariants like movement endpoint accuracy and minimal cost. Our review 
      revealed that elbow extension without triceps brachii relies on increased 
      scapulothoracic and glenohumeral movements providing a dynamic coupling between 
      shoulder and elbow. Furthermore, contrary to normal grasping patterns where 
      grasping is prepared during the transport phase, reaching and grasping are 
      performed successively after SCI. The prolonged transport phase ensures correct 
      hand placement while the grasping relies on wrist extension eliciting either 
      whole hand or lateral grip. One of the main kinematic characteristics observed 
      after tetraplegia is motor slowing attested by increased movement time. This 
      could be caused by (i) decreased strength, (ii) triceps brachii paralysis which 
      disrupts normal agonist-antagonist co-contractions, (iii) accuracy preservation 
      at movement endpoint, and/or (iv) grasping relying on tenodesis. Another feature 
      is a reduction of maximal superior reaching during overhead movements which could 
      be caused by i) strength deficit in agonist muscles like pectoralis major, ii) 
      strength deficit in proximal synergic muscles responsible for scapulothoracic and 
      glenohumeral joint stability, iii) strength deficit in distal synergic muscles 
      preventing the maintenance of elbow extension by shoulder elbow dynamic coupling, 
      iv) shoulder joint ankyloses, and/or v) shoulder pain. Further studies on open 
      chain movements are needed to identify the contribution of each of these factors 
      in order to tailor upper limb rehabilitation programs for SCI individuals.

TI  - Intertester reliability of shoulder complaints diagnoses in primary health care.
PG  - 224-31
LID - 10.1080/02813432.2016.1207139 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Shoulder complaints are frequently encountered in general practice, 
      but precise diagnosing is challenging. This study investigated agreement of 
      shoulder complaints diagnoses between clinicians in a primary health care 
      setting. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Four primary health care 
      clinicians used patients' history and functional examination of the shoulder by 
      selective tissue tension techniques (STTs), to diagnose shoulder complaints. 
      SUBJECTS: 62 patients, aged 18-75 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reliability of 
      diagnoses was assessed by observed intertester agreement and Cohen's kappa. A 
      total of 372 diagnostic pairs were available for intertester comparisons. 
      RESULTS: Six diagnoses were assigned by all clinicians; supraspinatus-, 
      infraspinatus-, subscapularis-tendinopathies; chronic subacromial bursitis; 
      glenohumeral capsulitis, and acromioclavicular joint lesion. The observed 
      agreement on these diagnoses ranged from 0.84 for glenohumeral capsulitis to 0.97 
      for acromioclavicular joint lesion. Kappa scores were 0.46 (95% CI 0.33, 0.58) 
      for chronic subacromial bursitis; 0.53 (95% CI 0.34, 0.68), 0.59 (95% CI 0.47, 
      0.70), and 0.68 (95% CI 0.53, 0.82) for infraspinatus -, supraspinatus -, and 
      subscapularis-tendinopathy, respectively. For glenohumeral capsulitis and 
      acromioclavicular lesion kappa scores were 0.66 (95% CI 0.57, 0.73) and 0.78 (95% 
      CI 0.61, 0.90). Kappa scores were higher for individual diagnoses than for 
      individual tests, except for limitation in passive abduction (0.70, 95% CI 0.62, 
      0.78) and passive lateral rotation (0.66, 95% CI 0.57, 0.73). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Although experienced clinicians showed substantial intertester agreement, precise 
      diagnoses of shoulder complaints in primary health care remain a challenge. The 
      present results call for further research on refined diagnoses of shoulder 
      complaints. Key points   Based on medical history and a systematic functional 
      examination by selective tissue tension techniques (STTs), we investigated the 
      agreement of shoulder complaints diagnoses across four primary health care 
      clinicians and 62 patients. • Agreements on diagnoses were generally better than 
      the agreement on individual tests. • Good kappa scores were obtained for the 
      diagnoses glenohumeral capsulitis, rotator cuff tendinopathy, and 
      acromioclavicular lesion. • Further research is necessary to investigate the 
      diagnostic validity of functional shoulder examination by the STTs method.

TI  - Use of Patient-Specific Instrumentation (PSI) for glenoid component positioning 
      in shoulder arthroplasty. A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e0201759

LID - e0201759
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA) anatomical, reverse or both is an 
      increasingly popular procedure but the glenoid component is still a weak element, 
      accounting for 30-50% of mechanical complications and contributing to the 
      revision burden. Component mal-positioning is one of the main aetiological 
      factors in glenoid failure and thus Patient-Specific Instrumentation (PSI) has 
      been introduced in an effort to optimise implant placement. The aim of this 
      systematic literature review and meta-analysis is to compare the success of PSI 
      and Standard Instrumentation (STDI) methods in reproducing pre-operative surgical 
      planning of glenoid component positioning. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A search 
      (restricted to English language) was conducted in November 2017 on MEDLINE, the 
      Cochrane Library, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov. Using the search terms 
      "Patient-Specific Instrumentation (PSI)", "custom guide", "shoulder", "glenoid" 
      and "arthroplasty", 42 studies were identified. The main exclusion criteria were: 
      no CT-scan analysis results; studies done on plastic bone; and use of a reusable 
      or generic guide. Eligible studies evaluated final deviations from the planning 
      for version, inclination, entry point and rotation. Reviewers worked 
      independently to extract data and assess the risk of bias on the same studies. 
      RESULTS: The final analysis included 12 studies, comprising 227 participants 
      (seven studies on 103 humans and five studies on 124 cadaveric specimens). 
      Heterogeneity was moderate or high for all parameters. Deviations from the 
      pre-operative planning for version (p<0.01), inclination (p<0.01) and entry point 
      (p = 0.02) were significantly lower with the PSI than with the STDI, but not for 
      rotation (p = 0.49). Accuracy (deviation from planning) with PSI was about 1.88° 
      to 4.96°, depending on the parameter. The number of component outliers (>10° of 
      deviation or 4mm) were significantly higher with STDI than with PSI (68.6% vs 
      15.3% (p = 0.01)). CONCLUSION: This review supports the idea that PSI enhances 
      glenoid component positioning, especially a decrease in the number of outliers. 
      However, the findings are not definitive and further validation is required. It 
      should be noted that no randomised clinical studies are available to confirm 
      long-term outcomes.

AB  - The objective of the research was to determine the optimal location and method of 
      attachment for accelerometer-based motion sensors, and to validate their ability 
      to differentiate rest and increases in speed in healthy dogs moving on a 
      treadmill. Two accelerometers were placed on a harness between the scapulae of 
      dogs with one in a pouch and one directly attached to the harness. Two additional 
      accelerometers were placed (pouched and not pouched) ventrally on the dog's 
      collar. Data were recorded in 1s epochs with dogs moving in stages lasting 3 min 
      each on a treadmill: (1) at rest, lateral recumbency, (2) treadmill at 0% slope, 
      3 km/h, (3) treadmill at 0% slope, 5 km/h, (4) treadmill at 0% slope, 7 km/h, (5) 
      treadmill at 5% slope, 5 km/h, and (6) treadmill at 5% slope, 7 km/h. Only the 
      harness with the accelerometer in a pouch along the dorsal midline yielded 
      statistically significant increases (P<0.05) in vector magnitude as walking speed 
      of the dogs increased (5-7 km/h) while on the treadmill. Statistically 
      significant increases in vector magnitude were detected in the dogs as the 
      walking speed increased from 5 to 7 km/h, however, changes in vector magnitude 
      were not detected when activity intensity was increased as a result of walking up 
      a 5% grade. Accelerometers are a valid and objective tool able to discriminate 
      between and monitor different levels of activity in dogs in terms of speed of 
      movement but not in energy expenditure that occurs with movement up hill.

LID - 10.1136/bjsm.2008.048074 [doi]
AB  - Chronic shoulder pain and dysfunction are common complaints among overhead 
      athletes seeking care from physical medicine and rehabilitation. Impingement is a 
      frequently described pathological condition in the overhead athlete. Impingement 
      symptoms may be the result of rotator cuff pathology, shoulder instability, 
      scapular dyskinesis or muscle dysfunction, biceps pathology, SLAP lesions and 
      chronic stiffness of the posterior capsule. At present, numerous different 
      shoulder tests have been described in literature and discussed with respect to 
      their individual diagnostic accuracy. However, in view of the number of shoulder 
      tests, it is often a challenge for the clinician to select the appropriate tests 
      for diagnosing the underlying pathology. The purpose of this paper is to present 
      and discuss a clinical algorithm which may be used in the early detection of the 
      underlying causes of impingement symptoms. In this algorithm, a specific 
      chronology and selection of diagnostic tests may offer the clinician a guideline 
      in his physical examination of the athlete with shoulder pain.

TI  - A biomechanical investigation of the static stabilisers of the glenohumeral joint 
      in the dog.
PG  - 55-61
AB  - The aim was to determine the relative contribution of the glenohumeral 
      ligaments/joint capsule complex and the limited joint volume/adhesion-cohesion 
      (UV/AC) mechanisms to the static stability of the canine glenohumeral joint 
      (GHJ). The GHJ of 32 complete cadaver specimens were manipulated to determine the 
      presence of gross laxity (> 2mm translation) at joint angles of 150 degrees, 135 
      degrees and 90 degrees. Following the removal of the peri-articular muscles, 
      laxity was measured by applying a 15N force to the scapula in a variety of 
      directions whilst the humerus was fixed to a jig. This was repeated for the 
      abovementioned angles in intact joints and after venting and flushing to 
      eliminate the UV/AC mechanisms. Results of clinical palpation and biomechanical 
      studies were compared. Manipulation revealed a marked variation between joints 
      although there was a tendency for progressive laxity as the joint was flexed. 
      This finding was supported by the biomechanical study that also demonstrated no 
      significant difference between intact and vented joints except in a cranio-caudal 
      direction at 135 degrees and 90 degrees, and in a medial/lateral direction at 135 
      degrees. Static stabilisers permitted a wide range of motion. Individual clinical 
      palpations did not correlate well with biomechanical findings. Manipulation was 
      difficult to perform and is unlikely to be a reliable method for determining 
      subtle joint laxity. The static stabilisers do not appear to play a significant 
      role in providing joint constraint during normal range of motion (except 
      extension). Diagnoses of pathological laxity attributable to the static 
      stabilisers should be made with caution and surgical treatments should take 
      cognizance of the above-mentioned biomechanical features.

TI  - Towards a new protocol of scoliosis assessments and monitoring in clinical 
      practice: A pilot study.
PG  - 721-30
LID - 10.3233/BMR-140574 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although intensively investigated, the procedures for assessment and 
      monitoring of scoliosis are still a subject of controversies. OBJECTIVE: The aim 
      of this study was to assess validity and reliability of a number of 
      physiotherapeutic measurements that could be used for clinical monitoring of 
      scoliosis. METHODS: Fifteen healthy (symmetric) subjects were subjected to a set 
      of measurements two times, by two experienced and two inexperienced 
      physiotherapists. Intra-observer and inter-observer reliability of measurements 
      were determined. Following measurements were performed: body height and weight, 
      chest girth in inspirium and expirium, the length of legs, the spine translation, 
      the lateral pelvic tilt, the equality of the shoulders, position of scapulas, the 
      equality of stature triangles, the rib hump, the existence of m. iliopsoas 
      contracture, Fröhner index, the size of lumbar lordosis and the angle of trunk 
      rotation. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficient was high (> 0.8) for 
      majority of measurements when experienced physiotherapists performed them, while 
      inexperienced physiotherapists performed precisely only basic, easy measurements. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We showed in this pilot study on healthy subjects, that majority of 
      basic physiotherapeutic measurements are valid and reliable when performed by 
      specialized physiotherapist, and it can be expected that this protocol will gain 
      high value when measurements on subjects with scoliosis are performed.

TI  - The Muscle Cross-sectional Area on MRI of the Shoulder Can Predict Muscle Volume: 
      An MRI Study in Cadavers.
PG  - 871-883
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000001044 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle volume is important in shoulder function. It can be used to 
      estimate shoulder muscle balance in health, pathology, and repair and is 
      indicative of strength based on muscle size. Although prior studies have shown 
      that muscle area on two-dimensional (2-D) images correlates with 
      three-dimensional (3-D) muscle volume, they have not provided equations to 
      predict muscle volume from imaging nor validation of the measurements. 
      QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We wished to create an algorithm that quickly, accurately, 
      and reliably estimates the volume of the shoulder muscles using cross-sectional 
      area on MR images with low error. Specifically, we wished to (1) determine which 
      MR imaging planes provide the highest correlation between shoulder muscle 
      cross-sectional area and volume; (2) derive equations to predict muscle volume 
      from cross-sectional area and validate their predictive capability; and (3) 
      quantify the reliability of muscle cross-sectional area measurement. METHODS: 
      Three-dimensional MRI was performed on 10 cadaver shoulders, with sample size 
      chosen for comparison to prior studies of shoulder muscle volume and in 
      consideration of the cost of comprehensive analysis, followed by dissection for 
      muscle volume measurement via water displacement. From each MR series, 3-D models 
      of the rotator cuff and deltoid muscles were generated, and 2-D slices of these 
      muscle models were selected at defined anatomic landmarks. Linear regression 
      equations were generated to predict muscle volume at the plane(s) with the 
      highest correlation between volume and area and for planes identified in prior 
      studies of muscle volume and area. Volume predictions from MR scans of six 
      different cadaver shoulders were also made, after which they were dissected to 
      quantify muscle volume. This validation population allowed the calculation of the 
      predictive error compared with actual muscle volume. Finally, reliability of 
      measuring muscle areas on MR images was calculated using intraclass correlation 
      coefficients for inter-rater reliability, as measured between two observers at a 
      single time point. RESULTS: The rotator cuff planes with the highest correlation 
      between volume and area were the sum of the glenoid face and the midpoint of the 
      scapula, and for the deltoid, it was the transverse plane at the top of the 
      greater tuberosity. Water and digital muscle volumes were highly correlated (r ≥ 
      0.993, error < 4%), and muscle areas correlated highly with volumes (r ≥ 0.992, 
      error < 2%). All correlations had p < 0.001. Muscle volume was predicted with low 
      mean error (< 10%). All intraclass correlation coefficients were > 0.925, 
      suggesting high inter-rater reliability in determining muscle areas from MR 
      images. CONCLUSION: Deltoid and rotator cuff muscle cross-sectional areas can be 
      reliably measured on MRI and predict muscle volumes with low error. CLINICAL 
      RELEVANCE: Using simple linear equations, 2-D muscle area measurements from 
      common clinical image analysis software can be used to estimate 3-D muscle 
      volumes from MR image data. Future studies should determine if these muscle 
      volume estimations can be used in the evaluation of patient function, changes in 
      shoulder health, and in populations with muscle atrophy. Additionally, these 
      muscle volume estimation techniques can be used as inputs to musculoskeletal 
      models examining kinetics and kinematics of humans that rely on subject-specific 
      muscle architecture.

TI  - Scapulothoracic kinematic pattern in the shoulder pain and scapular dyskinesis: A 
      principal component analysis approach.

AB  - The relationship between shoulder pain and scapular dyskinesis (SDK) is unclear. 
      Differences between groups with and without SDK have been demonstrated, focusing 
      on the amount of scapular motion at specific degrees of humeral elevation. 
      However, this approach does not consider the temporal information and shape of 
      the scapular motion temporal series. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) may 
      clarify this variability and advance current understanding of 'abnormal' movement 
      patterns. This study aimed to evaluate the scapular kinematics in patients with 
      shoulder pain and in asymptomatic participants with and without SDK using PCA. 
      Data were collected in 98 participants separated in four groups: Pain + SDK 
      (n = 24), Pain (n = 25), No Pain + SDK (n = 24), and No Pain (n = 25). 
      Scapulothoracic kinematic data were measured with an electromagnetic tracking 
      device during arm elevation and lowering phases. PCA and analysis of variance 
      were used to compare the groups. The No Pain + SDK group had a progressive 
      increasing in anterior tilt over the elevation phase compared to the Pain (effect 
      size = 0.79) and No Pain (effect size = 0.80) groups. During the arm-lowering, 
      the Pain + SDK group had a progressive increasing in anterior tilt over this 
      phase in comparison to the No Pain + SDK group (effect size = 0.68). Therefore, 
      PCA demonstrated differences in the scapular anterior tilt related to SDK and 
      shoulder pain. The presence of SDK revealed a scapular pattern with progressive 
      increasing in anterior tilt over the elevation phase. However, during the 
      arm-lowering phase, asymptomatic participants with SDK changed their motion 
      pattern, unlike the symptomatic group, reinforcing the suggested association 
      between scapular modifications and shoulder symptoms.

TI  - Functional assessment for shoulder impingement syndrome after anterior 
      acromioplasty.
PG  - 354-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Impingement syndrome is a common cause of shoulder pain. Conservative 
      treatment should always be initially considered. But for those patients with 
      persistent symptoms, open acromioplasty is a reliable method to relieve pain and 
      improve function. METHODS: From May 1989 to September 1994, a series of 36 
      anterior acromioplasties for impingement syndrome of the shoulder in 34 patients 
      was retrospectively analyzed. Among them, rotator cuff tear was found in 25, and 
      concomitant cuff repair was performed in 20. Five shoulders were not repaired 
      because of a massive tear with marked cuff retraction. Neer's functional criteria 
      and Constant's functional score were used to evaluate the results of anterior 
      acromioplasty. The postoperative evaluation included patient satisfaction, relief 
      of pain, range of motion and full use of the shoulder. RESULTS: Thirty-four 
      patients with an average follow-up of 34 months were available for assessment. 
      The average Constant's functional score was 94.7 points in the excellent group 
      (55.5%), 77.2 points in the good group (30.5%) and 58.6 points in the poor group 
      (13.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall there was an 86% satisfactory rate by Neer's 
      criteria. Anterior acromioplasty appears to be an effective procedure for 
      shoulder impingement syndrome.

TI  - Surgical management of the symptomatic os acromiale.
PG  - 521-8
AB  - Os acromiale is an uncommon cause of shoulder pain with symptoms often resulting 
      from an unstable meso-acromion. The associated pain may be due to impingement 
      from the unfused fragment, a concomitant rotator cuff tear, or gross motion at 
      the os acromiale site. Currently, initial treatment includes physical therapy, 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and subacromial corticosteroid injections. 
      Surgical intervention is reserved for patients who do not respond to nonoperative 
      treatment. Treatment options include open fragment excision, open reduction and 
      internal fixation, and arthroscopic decompression. Open fragment excision can 
      lead to persistent deltoid dysfunction and should be reserved for small fragments 
      or after failed internal fixation. Open reduction and internal fixation allows 
      for both preservation of large fragments and anterior deltoid function. Internal 
      fixation is technically difficult, has led to frequent nonunion rates and often 
      requires hardware removal as a result of postoperative irritation. Arthroscopic 
      subacromial decompression with complete or nearly complete resection of the 
      unstable meso-acromion can be performed without the aforementioned complications. 
      The surgical technique requires no special instrumentation and may be performed 
      reproducibly by those familiar with arthroscopic techniques of the shoulder. 
      Advantages include more rapid rehabilitation, better range of motion, and shorter 
      surgical times. Satisfactory short-term results have shown this to be an 
      effective treatment option for the unstable meso-acromion.

      indiscriminate imaging is expensive, may delay care, and unnecessarily exposes 
      patients to potentially harmful ionizing radiation. To improve diagnostic chest 
      imaging utilization, we conducted 3 prospective multicenter studies over 12years 
      to derive and validate decision instruments (DIs) to guide the use of chest x-ray 
      (CXR) and chest computed tomography (CT). The first DI, NEXUS Chest x-ray, 
      consists of seven criteria (Age >60years; rapid deceleration mechanism; chest 
      pain; intoxication; altered mental status; distracting painful injury; and chest 
      wall tenderness) and exhibits a sensitivity of 99.0% (95% confidence interval 
      [CI] 98.2-99.4%) and a specificity of 13.3% (95% CI, 12.6%-14.0%) for detecting 
      clinically significant injuries. We developed two NEXUS Chest CT DIs, which are 
      both highly reliable in detecting clinically major injuries (sensitivity of 
      99.2%; 95% CI 95.4-100%). Designed primarily to focus on detecting major 
      injuries, the NEXUS Chest CT-Major DI consists of six criteria (abnormal CXR; 
      distracting injury; chest wall tenderness; sternal tenderness; thoracic spine 
      tenderness; and scapular tenderness) and exhibits higher specificity (37.9%; 95% 
      CI 35.8-40.1%). Designed to reliability detect both major and minor injuries 
      (sensitivity 95.4%; 95% CI 93.6-96.9%) with resulting lower specificity (25.5%; 
      95% CI 23.5-27.5%), the NEXUS CT-All rule consists of seven elements (the six 
      NEXUS CT-Major criteria plus rapid deceleration mechanism). The purpose of this 
      review is to synthesize the three DIs into a novel, cohesive summary algorithm 
      with practical implementation recommendations to guide selective chest imaging in 
      adult blunt trauma patients.

AB  - Accuracy of shoulder kinematics predicted by multi-body kinematics optimisation 
      depend on the joint models used. This study assesses the influence of four 
      different subject-specific gleno-humeral joint models within multi-body 
      kinematics optimisation: a 6-degree-of-freedom joint (i.e. single-body kinematics 
      optimisation), a sphere-on-sphere joint (with two spheres of different radii) and 
      a spherical joint with or without penalised translation. To drive these models, 
      the 3D coordinates of 12 skin markers of 6 subjects performing static arm 
      abduction poses up to 180° were used. The reference data was obtained using 
      biplane X-rays from which 3D bone reconstructions were generated: scapula and 
      humerus were 3D reconstructed by fitting a template model made of geometrical 
      primitives on the two bones' X-rays. Without any motion capture system, the 
      recording of the skin markers was performed at the very same time than the X-rays 
      with radiopaque markers. The gleno-humeral displacements and angles, and 
      scapula-thoracic angles were computed. The gleno-humeral sphere-on-sphere joint 
      provided slightly better results than the spherical joint with or without 
      penalised translation, but considerably better gleno-humeral displacements than 
      the 6-DoF joint. Considering that it can easily be personalised from medical 
      images, this sphere-on-sphere model seems promising for shoulder multi-body 
      kinematics optimisation.

AB  - A comparison of electromyographic (EMG) activity of muscles between and within 
      subjects, and during separate occasions of testing, requires normalization. The 
      most common way for generating the reference level used for normalizing shoulder 
      EMG data is with a maximum isometric voluntary contraction (MVIC). The purpose of 
      this study was to develop a parsimonious set of standardized tests that generate 
      an MVIC in all the major muscle groups of the shoulder. Twelve muscles of the 
      dominant shoulder of 15 subjects were examined using a combination of surface and 
      intramuscular electrodes during 15 tests. The results indicated that many tests 
      maximally activated more than one muscle simultaneously. Four tests were 
      identified as being sufficient for generating an MVIC in the 12 muscles examined 
      and are recommended as the standard set for normalizing shoulder muscle EMG: 
      abduction 90 degrees with internal rotation ("empty can"), internal rotation in 
      90 degrees abduction ("internal rotation 90 degrees"), flexion at 125 degrees 
      with scapula resistance ("flexion 125 degrees"), and horizontal adduction at 90 
      degrees flexion ("palm press"). The use of these shoulder normalization tests 
      will make comparisons between shoulder EMG studies more reliable.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Observational, descriptive design. BACKGROUND: Despite scapular 
      mobility being essential for the completion of activities of daily living (ADLs), 
      there is currently no established, a reliable goniometric technique to measure 
      scapular protraction and retraction. A proposed method has shown clinically 
      significant inter-rater reliability for a goniometric technique for these 
      measurements. PURPOSE: This observational descriptive study examined the 
      intra-rater reliability of a goniometric technique to assess scapular protraction 
      and retraction among a sample of healthy adults. METHODS: An occupational 
      therapist who is a certified hand therapist (CHT) and an occupational therapy 
      student used goniometry to measure the neutral (resting), protracted, and 
      retracted positions of the right and left scapula for a sample of healthy young 
      adults (n = 54; a total of 108 data points for each measurement). These 
      measurements were compared to analyze intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. 
      RESULTS: For measurements of the scapula in neutral, protraction, and retraction, 
      the standard error of measure (SEM) for repeat measures by the expert and novice 
      raters was < 4.5° and < 3.9° respectively and ICC values ranged from poor to 
      moderate (0.37-0.63). The SEM for measures between evaluators was < 5.0° and the 
      ICC was poor (0.16-0.35). Minimum detectable change (MDC) values as a percentage 
      of the mean (% MDC) ranged between 15.9 and 43.7% for intra-rater reliability and 
      21.9-52.8% for inter-rater reliability. DISCUSSION: The results of the study were 
      mixed; variance of less than 5° for repeat measures by the same rater and 
      measures between raters suggest clinically acceptable reliability. However, 
      variance as a proportion of available motion (%MDC) demonstrates a broader range 
      both above and below the threshold of 30% suggested for rehabilitation 
      assessments. CONCLUSION: There are few efficient, reliable techniques to measure 
      scapular mobility in clinical practice. The absolute reliability of goniometry to 
      measure scapular protraction and retraction is similar to measurements of other 
      joints. However, additional research and possible refinement of the technique is 
      recommended to further address relative reliability and validity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study presents the preliminary results of a new arthroscopic 
      technique consisting of the association of 2 procedures, capsulolabral repair and 
      subscapularis augmentation tenodesis, in the treatment of traumatic anterior 
      shoulder instability with both glenoid bone loss and a Hill-Sachs lesion. 
      METHODS: Eighty-nine patients engaged in sports were enrolled in this 
      retrospective case-series study with 2 to 5 years' follow-up. All patients 
      underwent a computed tomography scan to assess the percentage of glenoid bone 
      loss by the Pico method. A prior stabilization procedure had failed in 20 
      patients, who were then segregated into a different group. Visual analog scale 
      (VAS), Rowe, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores were used to 
      assess the results. RESULTS: Only 3 of 89 patients had a post-traumatic 
      redislocation. The mean length of follow-up was 31.5 months (range, 
      25-60 months). The VAS, Rowe, and ASES scores showed significant improvements: 
      The VAS score decreased from a mean of 3.1 to 0.5 (P = .0157), the Rowe score 
      increased from 58.9 to 94.1 (P = .0215), and the ASES score increased from 68.5 
      to 95.5 (P = .0197). The mean deficit of external rotation was 6° with the arm at 
      the side of the trunk, and the mean deficit was 3° with the arm in 90° of 
      abduction. CONCLUSIONS: The described procedure is a reproducible and effective 
      technique used to restore joint stability in patients engaged in sports who have 
      incurred anterior recurrent shoulder dislocation associated with glenoid bone 
      loss (<25%) and a Hill-Sachs lesion.

AB  - Objectives. To establish anatomical landmarks for biceps tendon groove 
      localization based on intrinsic anatomical relations and to validate the 
      localization with ultrasonographic measurement. Design. Perspective, 
      observational, single-blinded pilot study. Participants. 25 healthy male and 
      female volunteers ages 24-50 years. Methods. We used two anatomical landmarks, 
      the medial epicondyle vertical line related landmark and the coracoid process 
      landmark. The distance from the groove skin mark to the medial epicondyle 
      vertical line and the coracoid process was measured horizontally and was measured 
      at 0° and 45° of shoulder external rotation, respectively. Results. Medial 
      epicondyle vertical lines were 9.3 mm/21.5 mm medial to the groove at 0°/45° of 
      shoulder external rotation, respectively. Correlation coefficients were 
      0.04/0.10, 0.32/0.42, and 0.26/0.37 for weight, height, and BMI in 0°/45° of 
      shoulder external rotation, respectively. The distance between the coracoid 
      process and the groove was 44.0 mm/62.2 mm in 0°/45° of shoulder external 
      rotation, respectively. Correlation coefficients were 0.36/0.41, 0.36/0.54, and 
      0.18/0.12 for weight, height, and BMI in 0°/45° of shoulder external rotation, 
      respectively. Conclusions. The medial epicondyle vertical line and the coracoid 
      process landmark are both useful anatomical landmarks to localize the biceps 
      groove. The anatomical landmark based localization is essentially not correlated 
      with subject's weight, height, or BMI.

AB  - Based on the 7-year experience of the Italian Clinical Network for FSHD, we 
      revised the FSHD clinical form to describe, in a harmonized manner, the 
      phenotypic spectrum observed in FSHD. The new Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation 
      Form (CCEF) defines various clinical categories by the combination of different 
      features. The inter-rater reproducibility of the CCEF was assessed between two 
      examiners using kappa statistics by evaluating 56 subjects carrying the molecular 
      marker used for FSHD diagnosis. The CCEF classifies: (1) subjects presenting 
      facial and scapular girdle muscle weakness typical of FSHD (category A, 
      subcategories A1-A3), (2) subjects with muscle weakness limited to scapular 
      girdle or facial muscles (category B subcategories B1, B2), (3) 
      asymptomatic/healthy subjects (category C, subcategories C1, C2), (4) subjects 
      with myopathic phenotype presenting clinical features not consistent with FSHD 
      canonical phenotype (D, subcategories D1, D2). The inter-rater reliability study 
      showed an excellent concordance of the final four CCEF categories with a κ equal 
      to 0.90; 95 % CI (0.71; 0.97). Absolute agreement was observed for categories C 
      and D, an excellent agreement for categories A [κ = 0.88; 95 % CI (0.75; 1.00)], 
      and a good agreement for categories B [κ = 0.79; 95 % CI (0.57; 1.00)]. The CCEF 
      supports the harmonized phenotypic classification of patients and families. The 
      categories outlined by the CCEF may assist diagnosis, genetic counseling and 
      natural history studies. Furthermore, the CCEF categories could support selection 
      of patients in randomized clinical trials. This precise categorization might also 
      promote the search of genetic factor(s) contributing to the phenotypic spectrum 
      of disease.

TI  - The measurement of shoulder alignment in cricket fast bowling.
PG  - 507-10
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare thoracic spine alignment with two- and 
      three-dimensional calculations of shoulder alignment (defined as a line joining 
      the acromion processes of the right and left scapula) when all measures were 
      projected onto the transverse plane. A six-camera Vicon system was used to 
      reconstruct three markers positioned on the plane of the thorax such that the 
      orthogonal vector to the thoracic spine, projected onto the transverse plane, was 
      used as a virtual shoulder alignment during cricket fast bowling. This same 
      measurement system was used to calculate the three-dimensional line between the 
      acromion processes projected onto the transverse plane. These acromion markers 
      were also used to calculate the two-dimensional transverse plane alignment of the 
      shoulders from images recorded by a video camera positioned above ball release. 
      All cameras operated at 50 Hz. A significant association was recorded between 
      thorax alignment and the three- (0.97) and two-dimensional (0.87) shoulder 
      alignment estimations at back-foot impact. The strength of association remained 
      at front-foot impact, when correlations of 0.89 (three-dimensional) and 0.84 
      (two-dimensional) were recorded. However, at ball release, non-significant 
      associations of 0.58 (three-dimensional) and 0.41 (two-dimensional), representing 
      shoulder alignment differences of approximately 10 degrees, were recorded. The 
      95% limits of agreement comparisons for shoulder alignment at back-foot impact, 
      front-foot impact and ball release produced mean random errors for the two 
      comparisons of 9.5 degrees, 11.7 degrees and 22.5 degrees respectively. Three- 
      and two-dimensional transverse plane projections of shoulder alignment are 
      reasonable estimates of thorax alignment at back-foot impact and front-foot 
      impact but not at ball release.

AB  - Healthy shoulder function requires the coordination of the rotator cuff muscles 
      to maintain the humeral head's position in the glenoid. While glenohumeral 
      stability has been studied in various settings, few studies have characterized 
      the effect of dynamic rotator cuff muscle loading on glenohumeral translation 
      during shoulder motion. We hypothesize that dynamic rotator cuff muscle 
      activation decreases joint translation during continuous passive abduction of the 
      humerus in a cadaveric model of scapular plane glenohumeral abduction. The effect 
      of different rotator cuff muscle activity on glenohumeral translation was 
      assessed using a validated shoulder testing system. The Dynamic Load profile is a 
      novel approach, based on musculoskeletal modeling of human subject motion. 
      Passive humeral elevation in the scapular plane was applied via the testing 
      system arm, while the rotator cuff muscles were activated according to the 
      specified force profiles using stepper motors and a proportional control feedback 
      loop. Glenohumeral translation was defined according to the International Society 
      of Biomechanics. The Dynamic load profile minimized superior translation of the 
      humeral head relative to the conventional loading profiles. The total magnitude 
      of translation was not significantly different (0.805) among the loading profiles 
      suggesting that the compressive forces from the rotator cuff primarily alter the 
      direction of humeral head translation, not the magnitude. Rotator cuff muscle 
      loading is an important element of cadaveric shoulder studies that must be 
      considered to accurately simulate glenohumeral motion. A rotator cuff muscle 
      activity profile based on human subject muscle activity reduces superior 
      glenohumeral translation when compared to previous RC loading profiles.

TI  - Reliability of 3-Dimensional Glenoid Component Templating and Correlation to 
      Intraoperative Component Selection.
PG  - E280-E292
AB  - Although implant-specific intraoperative targeting devices for glenoid sizing 
      exist, a validated method for preoperatively templating glenoid component size in 
      primary total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) based on digital imaging does not. We 
      conducted a study to determine if 3-dimensional (3-D) digital imaging could be 
      used for preoperative templating of glenoid component size and to compare 
      templated glenoid sizes with implanted glenoid sizes. We created 3-D digital 
      models from 3 glenoid component implant sizes and preoperative scapular computed 
      tomography scans of 24 patients who underwent primary TSA. In study arm 1, 
      surgeons templated the 3-D components using only 2 df (superior-inferior and 
      anterior-posterior planes). In study arm 2, surgeons templated the 3-D components 
      using 6 df (superior-inferior, anterior-posterior, and rotational planes). 
      Overall intraobserver agreement was substantial (0.67) in study arm 1 (P < .001) 
      and moderate (0.58) in study arm 2 (P < .001). In arm 1, overall interobserver 
      agreement was fair (0.36) for trial 1 (P < .001) and fair (0.32) for trial 2 (P < 
      .001). In arm 2, overall interobserver agreement was moderate (0.54) for trial 1 
      (P < .001) and moderate (0.43) for trial 2 (P < .001). In both arms, surgeons 
      tended to template glenoid components smaller than those implanted 
      intraoperatively, particularly for female patients. Our findings show that 3-D 
      digital models can be consistently and reliably used for preoperative templating 
      of glenoid com-ponent size.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Large glenoid bone defects in the setting of glenohumeral arthritis 
      can present a challenge to the shoulder arthroplasty surgeon. The results of 
      large structural autografting at the time of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty 
      (RTSA) are relatively unknown. METHODS: This retrospective case series describes 
      the clinical and radiographic results of large structural autografting from the 
      humeral head to the glenoid during primary RTSA. RESULTS: Of 17 patients who met 
      inclusion criteria, 14 (82% follow-up) were evaluated postoperatively at a mean 
      of 2.6 years (range, 2.0-5.4 years). Mean inclination correction was 19° ± 12° 
      (range, 3°-35°). Complications occurred in 3 patients, including 1 transient 
      brachial plexus palsy, 1 loose baseplate, and 1 dislocation treated with closed 
      reduction. Radiographic images showed 100% of grafts incorporated. Active forward 
      elevation improved from 80° ± 40° to 130° ± 49° (P = .028). The visual analog 
      scale score for pain improved from 8.1 ± 1.3 to 2.5 ± 3.1 (P = .005). The Simple 
      Shoulder Test improved from 1.8 ± 1.1 to 6.5 ± 4 (P = .012). The American 
      Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score improved from 22 ± 10 to 66 ± 25 (P = .012). 
      All patients (100%) were satisfied, and all patients (93%) but 1 stated that they 
      would undergo the procedure again if given the chance. CONCLUSIONS: RTSA 
      incorporating structural grafting of the glenoid with humeral head autograft 
      results in significant improvements in active forward elevation, pain, and 
      function, with a low complication rate. This technique can reliably be used to 
      achieve correction of large (up to 35°) glenoid defects with a 93% chance of 
      baseplate survival and a 100% chance of graft incorporation in the short-term.

TI  - Roentgenographic findings in massive rotator cuff tears. A long-term observation.
PG  - 92-6
AB  - It is difficult to determine the size and localization of rotator cuff tears 
      preoperatively. But with the special arthrographic technique, a diagnosis with 
      about 80% accuracy was possible in 65 surgically confirmed rotator cuff tears. 
      With this technique, 22 massive cuff tears were found in conservatively treated 
      patients. In these patients, the plain roentgenograms obtained at the initial 
      examination were also analyzed. The roentgenographic findings included narrowing 
      of the acromiohumeral interval and degenerative changes of the humeral head, the 
      tuberosities, the acromion, the acromioclavicular joint, and the glenohumeral 
      joint. Based on these data, five roentgenographic grades of massive cuff tears 
      were identified. Of seven patients with massive tears, which had been treated 
      conservatively and followed for more than eight years, the roentgenographic 
      grades advanced in five. One shoulder progressed to cuff-tear arthropathy. Based 
      on these observations, it is proposed that the following pathogenetic mechanisms 
      are responsible for the progressive roentgenographic changes: (1) arm elevation 
      in activities of daily living, (2) rupture of the long head of biceps tendon, (3) 
      the abnormal fulcrum of the humeral head against the acromion and the 
      coracoacromial ligament, and (4) the weakness of external rotation. A massive 
      cuff tear will progress to cuff-tear arthropathy, with each step of progression 
      accompanied by characteristic roentgenographic changes.

TI  - The relationship of strength and muscle balance to shoulder pain and impingement 
      syndrome in elite quadriplegic wheelchair rugby players.
PG  - 210-4
AB  - Wheelchair athletes are susceptible to injuries related to overuse of the 
      shoulder, in particular shoulder impingement syndrome. The present study examined 
      the relationship of shoulder pain to demographic details, isokinetic strength and 
      muscle balance in 8 elite quadriplegic rugby players. Demographic data were 
      collected using personal interviews and each subject was clinically examined for 
      signs of impingement syndrome by a physician. In addition each subject underwent 
      bilateral isokinetic strength testing of the shoulder at 60 and 180 deg/s for 
      abduction/adduction and internal/external rotation. A series of step-wise 
      multiple discriminant analysis successfully predicted clinical symptoms from 
      demographic, muscular strength and balance data. In particular, there was a 
      significant deficit in adductor strength and this was related to shoulder pain 
      and wasting of the scapular muscles. This strength deficit may be due to the high 
      level of spinal lesions in the quadriplegic population. The level of spinal 
      lesion may contribute to the aetiology of shoulder pathology in quadriplegia, and 
      differentiate it from that observed in able-bodied athletes who exhibit weak 
      abductors.

TI  - Surface contamination artificially elevates initial sweat mineral concentrations.
PG  - 1534-40
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.01437.2010 [doi]
AB  - Several sweat mineral element concentrations decline with serial sampling. 
      Possible causes include reduced dermal mineral concentrations or flushing of 
      surface contamination. The purpose of this study was to simultaneously sample 
      mineral concentrations in transdermal fluid (TDF), sweat, and serum during 
      extended exercise-heat stress to determine if these compartments show the same 
      serial changes during repeat sampling. Sixteen heat-acclimated individuals walked 
      on a treadmill (1.56 m/s, 3.0% grade) in a 35°C, 20% relative humidity (RH), 1 
      m/s wind environment 50 min each hour for 3 h. Mineral concentrations of Ca, Cu, 
      Fe, K, Mg, Na, and Zn were measured each hour from serum, sweat from upper back 
      (sweat pouch) and arm (bag), and TDF from the upper back. Sites were meticulously 
      cleaned to minimize surface contamination. Mineral concentrations were determined 
      by spectrometry. TDF remained stable over time, with exception of a modest 
      increase in TDF [Fe] (15%) and decrease in TDF [Zn] (-18%). Likewise, serum and 
      pouch sweat samples were stable over time. In contrast, the initial arm bag sweat 
      mineral concentrations were greater than those in the sweat pouch, and [Ca], 
      [Cu], [Mg], and [Zn] declined 26-76% from initial to the subsequent samples, 
      becoming similar to sweat pouch. Nominal TDF mineral shifts do not affect sweat 
      mineral concentrations. Arm bag sweat mineral concentrations are initially 
      elevated due to skin surface contaminants that are not removed despite meticulous 
      cleaning (e.g., under fingernails, on arm hair), then decrease with extended 
      sweating and approach those measured from the scapular region.

TI  - Lines of action and stabilizing potential of the shoulder musculature.
PG  - 184-97
LID - 10.1111/j.1469-7580.2009.01090.x [doi]
AB  - The objective of the present study was to measure the lines of action of 18 major 
      muscles and muscle sub-regions crossing the glenohumeral joint of the human 
      shoulder, and to compute the potential contribution of these muscles to joint 
      shear and compression during scapular-plane abduction and sagittal-plane flexion. 
      The stabilizing potential of a muscle was found by assessing its contribution to 
      superior/inferior and anterior/posterior joint shear in the scapular and 
      transverse planes, respectively. A muscle with stabilizing potential was oriented 
      to apply more compression than shear at the glenohumeral joint, whereas a muscle 
      with destabilizing potential was oriented to apply more shear. Significant 
      differences in lines of action and stabilizing capacities were measured across 
      sub-regions of the deltoid and rotator cuff in both planes of elevation (P < 
      0.05), and substantial differences were observed in the pectoralis major and 
      latissimus dorsi. The results showed that, during abduction and flexion, the 
      rotator cuff muscle sub-regions were more favourably aligned to stabilize the 
      glenohumeral joint in the transverse plane than in the scapular plane and that, 
      overall, the anterior supraspinatus was most favourably oriented to apply 
      glenohumeral joint compression. The superior pectoralis major and inferior 
      latissimus dorsi were the chief potential scapular-plane destabilizers, 
      demonstrating the most significant capacity to impart superior and inferior shear 
      to the glenohumeral joint, respectively. The middle and anterior deltoid were 
      also significant potential contributors to superior shear, opposing the combined 
      destabilizing inferior shear potential of the latissimus dorsi and inferior 
      subscapularis. As potential stabilizers, the posterior deltoid and subscapularis 
      had posteriorly-directed muscle lines of action, whereas the teres minor and 
      infraspinatus had anteriorly-directed lines of action. Knowledge of the lines of 
      action and stabilizing potential of individual sub-regions of the shoulder 
      musculature may assist clinicians in identifying muscle-related joint 
      instabilities, assist surgeons in planning tendon reconstructive surgery, aid in 
      the development of rehabilitation procedures designed to improve joint stability, 
      and facilitate development and validation of biomechanical computer models of the 
      shoulder complex.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Physiological and functional ratios of internal and external rotators 
      are used to assess the muscle balance of shoulder joint. Ratios are usually 
      calculated from the peak torque value (PT) of each muscle group, without taking 
      into account the angular positions at which PT are reached. The aim of our study 
      was to propose an alternative and reliable method based on sectorial analysis for 
      isokinetic assessment of the shoulder muscle balance. METHOD: 22 men 
      (23.0 ± 2.7y) participated in isokinetic tests of the muscle rotators in a seated 
      position in scapular plane, at 60 °s(-1), in concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) 
      modes for both shoulders. Peak torque (PT) and torque averaged per range of 10° 
      (T) were calculated for internal and external rotators. Physiological and 
      functional ratios were calculated with classic peak approach (PT-ratios) and new 
      sectorial approach (T-ratios). RESULTS: PT-ratios and T-ratios were different 
      (P < 0.05). T-ratios were different between the angular ranges (P < 0.05). The 
      reliability was variable as function of angular ranges. The majority of the 
      T-ratios calculated over non-extreme angular ranges were more reliable than 
      PT-ratios (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.14-0.75; coefficient of 
      variation=7.0-28.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The angular range method showed a better 
      reliability than the peak torque method. Angular range method better reflects the 
      functional reality because it takes into account the muscular potential in its 
      entirety of the range of movement.

AB  - In this work, we extend the modeling techniques of human shoulder-arm 
      musculoskeletal dynamics by 1) proposing an extended model with 12 joint degrees 
      of freedom and 27 muscles (modeled as 42 musculotendinous actuators) that is 
      capable of most physiologically and anatomically possible movements, 2) proposing 
      a forward dynamics model driven by muscle activation, where the scapulothoracic 
      constraint is formulated as an anatomically consistent force field, and 3) 
      applying the state-of-the-art inverse dynamics solution on this model. We 
      experimentally validate it against electromyograms for 10 activities of daily 
      living. This validated shoulder-arm musculoskeletal model may e.g., serve as a 
      reference plant model in studying human motor control or as part of a human 
      simulator in the future.

TI  - Arthroscopic labral repair to the glenoid rim.
PG  - 20-30
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a new arthroscopic approach for 
      traumatic instability that effectively reattaches avulsed capsulolabral tissue to 
      the glenoid articular rim with sutures. This technique does not depend on 
      fixation devices, trans-scapular drilling, or implantation of suture anchors. We 
      attached a three-dimensional position sensor and force and torque transducer to 
      the humerus and scapula of eight normal cadaveric shoulders to measure the 
      normal, surgically unstable (arthroscopic Bankart lesion), and repaired 
      preparations. We assessed eight motion ranges and six laxity tests. Capsulolabral 
      release increased all passive ranges and allowed significant translational 
      increases on posterior drawer and crank testing. After repair, motion was never 
      decreased and there were no differences in laxity relative to normal. 
      Neurovascular structures were never at risk. Our arthroscopic repair provides 
      anatomic reattachment and effective deepening of the glenoid con-cavity similar 
      to that achieved by open repair. This new method restores joint stability, 
      preserves motion, and can withstand forceful loads. Ongoing clinical trials will 
      substantiate whether the technique is as safe and reliable as shown 
      cadaverically.

TI  - Validation of a new model-based tracking technique for measuring 
      three-dimensional, in vivo glenohumeral joint kinematics.
PG  - 604-9
AB  - Shoulder motion is complex and significant research efforts have focused on 
      measuring glenohumeral joint motion. Unfortunately, conventional motion 
      measurement techniques are unable to measure glenohumeral joint kinematics during 
      dynamic shoulder motion to clinically significant levels of accuracy. The purpose 
      of this study was to validate the accuracy of a new model-based tracking 
      technique for measuring three-dimensional, in vivo glenohumeral joint kinematics. 
      We have developed a model-based tracking technique for accurately measuring in 
      vivo joint motion from biplane radiographic images that tracks the position of 
      bones based on their three-dimensional shape and texture. To validate this 
      technique, we implanted tantalum beads into the humerus and scapula of both 
      shoulders from three cadaver specimens and then recorded biplane radiographic 
      images of the shoulder while manually moving each specimen's arm. The position of 
      the humerus and scapula were measured using the model-based tracking system and 
      with a previously validated dynamic radiostereometric analysis (RSA) technique. 
      Accuracy was reported in terms of measurement bias, measurement precision, and 
      overall dynamic accuracy by comparing the model-based tracking results to the 
      dynamic RSA results. The model-based tracking technique produced results that 
      were in excellent agreement with the RSA technique. Measurement bias ranged from 
      -0.126 to 0.199 mm for the scapula and ranged from -0.022 to 0.079 mm for the 
      humerus. Dynamic measurement precision was better than 0.130 mm for the scapula 
      and 0.095 mm for the humerus. Overall dynamic accuracy indicated that rms errors 
      in any one direction were less than 0.385 mm for the scapula and less than 0.374 
      mm for the humerus. These errors correspond to rotational inaccuracies of 
      approximately 0.25 deg for the scapula and 0.47 deg for the humerus. This new 
      model-based tracking approach represents a non-invasive technique for accurately 
      measuring dynamic glenohumeral joint motion under in vivo conditions. The 
      model-based technique achieves accuracy levels that far surpass all previously 
      reported non-invasive techniques for measuring in vivo glenohumeral joint motion. 
      This technique is supported by a rigorous validation study that provides a 
      realistic simulation of in vivo conditions and we fully expect to achieve these 
      levels of accuracy with in vivo human testing. Future research will use this 
      technique to analyze shoulder motion under a variety of testing conditions and to 
      investigate the effects of conservative and surgical treatment of rotator cuff 
      tears on dynamic joint stability.

TI  - The early migration of a partially cemented fluted pegged glenoid component using 
      radiostereometric analysis.
PG  - 1191-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2011.07.028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiostereometric analysis measures the position of rigid bodies in 3 
      dimensions with very high precision and can be used to measure early micromotion 
      of glenoid implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiostereometric analysis was used 
      to measure migration of 11 partially cemented fluted pegged glenoid components in 
      patients with osteoarthritis who underwent shoulder arthroplasty during a 2-year 
      period. Patients were evaluated using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons 
      (ASES) and Constant scores and by a computed tomography (CT) scan at the 2-year 
      follow-up. RESULTS: Migration patterns could be classified into 2 groups: The 
      first group showed little if any migration, the second group rotated by 4° or 
      more as early as 3 months after operation. The maximum total point motion reached 
      up to 2 mm by the 6-month follow-up. At 12 months, the 2 groups could be 
      identified by the presence or absence of focal lucency around the central peg. At 
      the end of 2 years, CT scans were able to classify the same 2 migration patterns 
      by the presence or absence of osseointegration around the cementless central peg 
      of the glenoid implant. The clinical effect of the absence of osseointegration in 
      this novel glenoid component is unknown because both groups had similar clinical 
      results at 2 years. CONCLUSION: Rapid early migration associated with focal 
      lucency and absence of osseointegration was observed in 6 of 11 components. We 
      postulate that lack of initial fixation leads to early movement of the glenoid 
      component and failure of osseointegration.

TI  - Late results of total shoulder replacement in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 39-45
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis of the shoulder is a progressive and destructive joint 
      disease, and similar to arthritis in other joints, progression of the disease is 
      unpredictable and may stop at any stage of involvement. Between 1983 and 1996, 
      more than 500 shoulder prostheses were implanted in patients at the authors' 
      institution. Total shoulder replacement yields satisfactory short and long term 
      results even in patients with severely destructed joints. Pain relief is reliable 
      and significant as reported in short and long term studies. In most patients the 
      functional result is good or acceptable. Although range of motion is only 
      slightly increased, a satisfactory overall range of motion is achieved by most 
      patients because of the unaffected scapulothoracic motion. However, deteriorating 
      results, emphasizing the complexity of shoulder arthroplasty, were seen with 
      increasing observation time in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Proximal 
      migration of the humeral prosthesis attributable to rotator cuff failure, with 
      secondary eccentric glenoid loading and progressive loosening, is latent in 
      patients with chronic progressive rheumatoid disease and was by far the most 
      common complication (42%) in the present series.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The effectiveness of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) for 
      improving athletic performance in healthy athletes is unclear. Assessing the 
      effect of SMT on other performance outcomes in asymptomatic populations may 
      provide insight into the management of athletes where direct evidence may not be 
      available. Our objective was to systematically review the literature on the 
      effect of SMT on performance-related outcomes in asymptomatic adults. METHODS: 
      MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      were systematically searched from 1990 to March 23, 2018. Inclusion criteria was 
      any study examining a performance-related outcome of SMT in asymptomatic adults. 
      Methodological quality was assessed using the SIGN criteria. Studies with a low 
      risk of bias were considered scientifically admissible for a best evidence 
      synthesis. We calculated the between group mean change and 95% confidence 
      intervals. RESULTS: Of 1415 articles screened, 20 studies had low risk of bias, 
      seven were randomized crossover trials, 10 were randomized controlled trials 
      (RCT) and three were RCT pilot trials. Four studies showed SMT had no effect on 
      physiological parameters at rest or during exercise. There was no effect of SMT 
      on scapular kinematics or transversus abdominus thickness. Three studies 
      identified changes in muscle activation of the upper or lower limb, compared to 
      two that did not. Five studies showed changes in range of motion (ROM). One study 
      showed an increase lumbar proprioception and two identified changes in 
      baropodometric variables after SMT. Sport-specific studies show no effect of SMT 
      except for a small increase in basketball free-throw accuracy. CONCLUSION: The 
      preponderance of evidence suggests that SMT in comparison to sham or other 
      interventions does not enhance performance-based outcomes in asymptomatic adult 
      population. All studies are exploratory with immediate effects. In the few 
      studies suggesting a positive immediate effect, the importance of such change is 
      uncertain. Further high-quality performance specific studies are required to 
      confirm these preliminary findings.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging for supraspinatus muscle atrophy after cuff repair.
PG  - 93-9
AB  - Between 1998 to 2000, the shoulders of 17 patients with rotator cuff tears were 
      examined using magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively, and 6 and 12 months 
      after open surgical repair. To assess the course of the supraspinatus muscle 
      atrophy, the easily reproducible magnetic resonance imaging parameters occupation 
      ratio and tangent sign in the Y-shaped view of the supraspinous fossa were 
      evaluated and compared with the clinical examination. Occupation ratio is a 
      quantitative parameter that reflects the area ratio, expressed as a percentage of 
      the supraspinatus muscle belly to the supraspinous fossa. The tangent sign is a 
      qualitative parameter that represents a line connecting the coracoid process and 
      the apex of the scapular spine. Occupation ratio and tangent sign are reliable 
      diagnostic tools in magnetic resonance imaging assessment of supraspinatus muscle 
      atrophy. The sensitivity of the magnetic resonance imaging parameter occupation 
      ratio is 75% and the specificity is 85%. The imaging parameter tangent sign has a 
      sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 85%. There is a significant relationship 
      between occupation ratio, tangent sign, and improvement of strength and mobility 
      registered in the score of Constant and Murley 12 months after surgery.

TI  - The reproducibility of closed-pouch sweat collection and thermoregulatory 
      responses to exercise-heat stress.
PG  - 748-51
AB  - Seven active male subjects cycled for 60 min at 29.5 (0.8)% peak work rate on 
      three separate occasions in a hot environmental condition [36.0 (0.1) degrees C, 
      60 (1)% relative humidity] in order to determine the reproducibility of a 
      closed-pouch sweat collection technique for sweat composition at the scapula, 
      forearm and thigh. To confirm that sweat composition was not influenced by 
      between-trial variations in sudomotor drive, local sweat rate, whole-body sweat 
      rate, heart rate (HR), rectal temperature (T(re)) and mean skin temperature 
      (T(sk)) responses were also measured, consequently reproducibility was also 
      established for these variables. Sweat composition did not differ among trials, 
      with the mean coefficients of variation (CVs) for sweat [Na(+)], [K(+)] and pH 
      being 10.4 (7.4)%, 8.1 (6.5)% and 1.3 (1.1)%, respectively. Local sweat rates did 
      not differ among the three trials (P>0.05) although whole-body sweat rate was 
      reduced in the third trial (P<0.05). The mean CVs were 11.0 (7.8)% and 4.7 (1.6)% 
      for local and whole-body sweat rates, respectively. Between-trial differences 
      were not evident for T(re), T(sk) or HR with mean CVs of 0.3 (0.2)%, 0.7 (0.6)% 
      and 3.9 (1.7)%, respectively, although HR tended to be greater in the first trial 
      ( P=0.08). It is proposed that moderate variations in sweat composition were 
      influenced by variations in the local sweat rate, which were induced by 
      application of the pouch.

TI  - Upper limb kinematics: development and reliability of a clinical protocol for 
      children.
PG  - 279-85
LID - 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2010.11.021 [doi]
AB  - This study proposed a child-friendly measurement procedure for the 
      three-dimensional analysis of upper limb movements, based on a comprehensive 
      movement protocol. Within and between session reliability was tested in a group 
      of 10 typically developing children (TDC) (mean age 10.3±3.2 years). The movement 
      protocol was constructed for children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP) and 
      contained three reach tasks (forwards, upwards, sideways), three reach-to-grasp 
      tasks (with objects requiring different hand orientations) and three gross motor 
      tasks. Upper limb kinematics were calculated following the ISB-guidelines. 
      Reliability of movement duration/speed and endpoint joint angles was assessed 
      with the intraclass correlation coefficient; similarity of the waveforms with the 
      coefficient of multiple correlation; measurement errors were also calculated. 
      Reliability coefficients were generally high for movement duration/speed and most 
      kinematic parameters. Endpoint angles for scapular tilting, shoulder elevation 
      plane and elevation, elbow flexion-extension and wrist ulnar-radial deviation 
      showed highest reliability. Angular waveforms were best repeated for scapular 
      medio-lateral rotation and pro-retraction, shoulder elevation plane and 
      elevation, and elbow flexion-extension. Results also seemed task-dependent. This 
      study indicated that the proposed procedure could be used reliably to quantify 
      upper limb movements in TDC. However, to compose proper age-related standards for 
      the different tasks, larger study samples are needed. This will also help with a 
      well-founded task-selection depending on the joints of interest. Finally, further 
      research will need to establish the reliability in children with HCP.

TI  - Functional outcome of glenohumeral fusion in brachial plexus palsy: a report of 
      54 cases.
PG  - 683-8
LID - 10.1016/j.jhsa.2012.01.012 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The restoration of shoulder function is a major issue in brachial plexus 
      palsy. Although several tendon and nerve transfers have been described, shoulder 
      arthrodesis remains a reliable technique in this context. This study planned to 
      compare surgical and functional outcomes of 2 glenohumeral arthrodesis bone graft 
      techniques: massive subacromial corticocancellous versus cancellous only grafts. 
      METHODS: We reviewed 54 patients who had shoulder arthrodesis according to 2 
      parameters after a mean follow-up of 37 months. The primary outcome measure was 
      the rate of fusion according to the surgical technique. A total of 26 patients 
      received a massive subacromial corticocancellous bone autograft, and 28 patients 
      received only cancellous bone. The secondary outcome measure was the range of 
      scapulothoracic motion measured by a video-assisted method according to type of 
      neurological lesion. Brachial plexus palsy was complete in 32 cases and partial 
      in 22 cases. All patients had recovered active elbow flexion before undergoing 
      shoulder arthrodesis. Of the 54 patients, 48 had no postoperative immobilization. 
      RESULTS: The overall fusion rate was 76% after the first surgical procedure and 
      94% at last follow-up. Reoperation led to fusion in 10 cases, whereas 3 cases 
      never fused. Pseudarthrosis rate after first surgery was 4% in the group with 
      massive subacromial graft versus 43% in the group with cancellous bone graft. The 
      mean range of motion was 59° in abduction (57° for complete palsy and 62° for 
      partial palsy) with 42 cases 45° or greater. The mean range of motion was 48° in 
      rotation (50° for complete palsy and 46° for partial palsy) with 35 cases 45° or 
      greater. CONCLUSIONS: Shoulder fusion provided active abduction greater than 45° 
      in more than 75% of cases and active rotation greater than 45° in almost 65% of 
      cases. Using a massive subacromial graft significantly reduced pseudarthrosis 
      rate (P < .001). TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic III.

AB  - This review investigates current protocols using Inertial Measurement Units 
      (IMUs) in shoulder research, and outlines future paths regarding IMU use for 
      shoulder research. Different databases were searched for relevant articles. 
      Criteria for study selection were (1) research in healthy persons or persons with 
      shoulder problems, (2) IMUs applied as assessment tool for the shoulder (in 
      healthy subjects and shoulder patients) or upper limb (in shoulder patients), (3) 
      peer-reviewed, full-text papers in English or Dutch. Studies with less than five 
      participants and without ethical approval were excluded. Data extraction included 
      (1) study design, (2) participant characteristics, (3) type/brand of IMU, (4) 
      tasks included in the assessment protocol, and (5) outcomes. Risk of bias was 
      assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Scapulothoracic/glenohumeral and 
      humerothoracic kinematics were reported in respectively 10 and 27 of the 37 
      included papers. Only one paper in healthy persons assessed, next to 
      scapulothoracic/glenohumeral kinematics, other upper limb joints. IMUs' validity 
      and reliability to capture shoulder function was limited. Considering applied 
      protocols, 39% of the protocols was located on the 
      International-Classification-of-Functioning (ICF) function level, while 38% and 
      23% were on the 'capacity' and 'actual performance'-sublevel, of the ICF-activity 
      level. Most available IMU-research regarding the shoulder is clinically less 
      relevant, given the widely reported humerothoracic kinematics which do not add to 
      clinical-decision-making, and the absence of protocols assessing the complete 
      upper limb chain. Apart from knowledge on methodological pitfalls and 
      opportunities regarding the use of IMUs, this review provides future research 
      paths.

TI  - [Arthrodesis of the shoulder for post-traumatic palsy of the brachial plexus. 
      Analysis of a series of 18 cases].
PG  - 386-95
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: In case of severe traction injuries of the supraclavicular 
      brachial plexus in adult, the functional results of direct shoulder nerve repair 
      are less predictable than those of the elbow. Furthermore, the surgical 
      management of the remaining flail shoulder is still controversial. The 
      post-operative results and the indication for shoulder arthrodesis are evaluated 
      in this study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between October 1978 and January 1994, 18 
      gleno-humeral arthrodesis were performed on 18 patients for paralytic shoulder 
      following brachial plexus injury. The average age at the time of operation was 25 
      years. A C5C6 lesion was present in 2 patients, a C5C6C7 lesion in 8 patients and 
      a C5 to T1 lesion in the remaining 8 patients. Seven patients had a suprascapular 
      nerve reinnervation failure. All these 18 patients recovered an active elbow 
      flexion spontaneously or following direct nerve repair, tendon or free muscle 
      transfer. The average delay between nerve repair and arthrodesis was 2 years and 
      4 months. For fixation, we always used internal fixation by screws, combined to 
      an external fixator device in 10 cases. RESULTS: 16 patients were reviewed with 
      an average follow-up of 6 years and 10 months (min. 6 months, max. 15 years and 8 
      months). Two types of complications occurred: 2 cases of gleno-humeral non-union 
      requiring revision with bone-grafting, and 3 humeral fractures in the first 6 
      months after arthrodesis. The study of the arthrodesis position showed an average 
      abduction of 25 degrees, an average flexion of 18 degrees, an average internal 
      rotation of 22 degrees. The average motion values are 60 degrees of abduction and 
      flexion, 14 degrees of extension, 0 degree of external rotation and 48 degrees of 
      internal rotation. The range of motion depends closely on scapulo-thoracic 
      muscles strength, especially the serratus anterior muscle. A flail hand primarily 
      influences the subjective result. 14 of the 16 patients could easily reach their 
      mouth. The average muscle shoulder strength, evaluated with the Isobex device, is 
      11 kg for flexion and abduction, 9 kg for adduction, 8 kg for internal rotation 
      and 4 kg for external rotation. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Gleno-humeral 
      arthrodesis is a reliable method for restoring shoulder function in case of 
      brachial plexus sequellae lesion, giving more strength, but less external 
      rotation than shoulder nerve repair.

TI  - Shoulder bony landmarks location using the EOS low-dose stereoradiography system: 
      a reproducibility study.
PG  - 153-8
LID - 10.1007/s00276-009-0566-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the reproducibility of shoulder bony landmarks location 
      using the EOS low-dose stereoradiography system, in order to validate this new 
      tool for the study of gleno-humeral pseudo-kinematics. METHODS: An inter and 
      intraobserver reproducibility study of shoulder bony landmarks location 
      concerning 22 healthy volunteers. This study concerned the neutral position, arm 
      at rest. Humerus and scapula were modeled with simple geometric shapes using 
      specific software. Those shapes were positioned on A-P and lateral x-rays views. 
      Images analysis of the 22 subjects was carried out three times (n(r) = 3), by two 
      observers (n(o) = 2), for a total of n(tot) = 132 analyses. RESULTS: We obtained 
      a very good reproducibility for the humeral head center and the diaphysis axis 
      with 95% confidence interval (IC95%) inferior to 1.09 mm and 0.41 degrees, 
      respectively. The uncertainty was higher for the lateral and medial epicondyles. 
      Regarding the scapular bony landmarks, we observed a good reproducibility for the 
      tip of the coracoid process, the inferior glenoid rim, and the axillar border 
      with a 95% confidence interval lower than 2.13, 2.91 mm, and 3.67 degrees, 
      respectively. The uncertainty was higher for the most postero-lateral point of 
      the acromion and the superior glenoid rim. CONCLUSION: Our analysis of the x-rays 
      obtained with the EOS low-dose stereoradiography system assessed the location 
      reliability and reproducibility of specific scapular and humeral bony landmarks. 
      This work opens the way to gleno-humeral pseudo-kinematics analysis using EOS 
      imaging system.

TI  - Improved Outcomes Following Arthroscopic Superior Capsular Reconstruction May Not 
      Be Associated With Changes in Shoulder Kinematics: An In Vivo Study.
PG  - 267-275
LID - S0749-8063(21)00637-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.arthro.2021.06.018 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the in vivo effects of superior capsule reconstruction 
      (SCR) on glenohumeral kinematics during abduction and to compare those kinematics 
      results with patient-reported outcomes, range of motion, and strength. METHODS: 
      Dynamic biplane radiography was used to image 10 patients with irreparable 
      rotator cuff tears while performing scapular plane abduction pre- and 1-year 
      post-surgery. Shoulder kinematics were determined by matching subject-specific 
      computed tomography-based bone models to the radiographs using a validated 
      tracking technique. RESULTS: No change was detected in static acromiohumeral 
      distance (-0.7 ± 2.1 mm; P = .35); however, average dynamic acromiohumeral 
      distance decreased (2.7 ± 1.2 mm to 2.3 ± 1.0 mm; P = .035) from pre- to 1-year 
      post-surgery, respectively. The humeral head position was 0.5 ± 0.5 mm more 
      superior 1-year post-surgery compared with pre-surgery (P = .01). Glenohumeral 
      abduction increased from pre-surgery (150 ± 20°) to 1-year post-surgery (165 ± 
      10°) (P = .04) and all patient-reported outcomes improved from pre-surgery to 
      1-year post-surgery (all P < .002). A more posterior shift in humeral head 
      position was associated with improved American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons 
      Shoulder Score from pre-surgery to 1-year post-surgery (r = 0.71, P = .02). 
      CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that SCR may not depress the humeral head during 
      functional abduction, as previously postulated, and postoperative improvements in 
      subjective and clinical outcomes may be affected by mechanisms other than changes 
      in shoulder kinematics. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In vivo kinematics changes after SCR 
      are small and do not correspond to previously postulated changes.

TI  - Effect of the Scapula Reposition Test on shoulder impingement symptoms and 
      elevation strength in overhead athletes.
PG  - 4-11
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Two group, repeated measures design. OBJECTIVES: To determine 
      whether manually repositioning the scapula using the Scapula Reposition Test 
      (SRT) reduces pain and increases shoulder elevation strength in athletes with and 
      without positive signs of shoulder impingement. BACKGROUND: Symptom alteration 
      tests may be useful in determining a subset of those with shoulder pathology who 
      may benefit from interventions aimed at improving scapular motion abnormalities. 
      METHODS AND MEASURES: One hundred forty-two college athletes underwent testing 
      for clinical signs of shoulder impingement. Tests provoking symptoms were 
      repeated with the scapula manually repositioned into greater retraction and 
      posterior tilt. A numeric rating scale was used to measure symptom intensity 
      under both conditions. Isometric shoulder elevation strength was measured using a 
      mounted dynamometer with the scapula in its natural position and with manual 
      repositioning. A paired t test was used to compare the strength between 
      positions. The frequency of a significant increase in strength with scapular 
      repositioning, defined as the minimal detectable change (90% confidence 
      interval), was also assessed. RESULTS: Of the 98 athletes with a positive 
      impingement test, 46 had reduced pain with scapular repositioning. Although 
      repositioning produced an increase in strength in both the impingement (P=.001) 
      and non-impingement groups (P=.012), a significant increase in strength was found 
      with repositioning in only 26% of athletes with, and 29% of athletes without 
      positive signs for shoulder impingement. CONCLUSION: The SRT is a simple clinical 
      test that may potentially be useful in an impairment based classification 
      approach to shoulder problems.

TI  - Graft healing does not influence subjective outcomes and shoulder kinematics 
      after superior capsule reconstruction: a prospective in vivo kinematic study.
PG  - S48-S56

LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2021.02.026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A viable treatment option for young patients with massive, 
      irreparable rotator cuff tears is arthroscopic superior capsule reconstruction 
      (SCR). SCR theoretically improves shoulder stability and function and decreases 
      pain. However, no prospective studies to date have correlated magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) healing with in vivo kinematic data. The purpose of this study was 
      to evaluate the association between graft healing and in vivo kinematics, range 
      of motion (ROM), strength, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). METHODS: Ten 
      patients (8 men and 2 women; mean age, 63 ± 7 years) with irreparable rotator 
      cuff tears underwent arthroscopic SCR with dermal allograft. Strength was 
      measured with isometric internal rotation and external rotation (ER) at 0° of 
      abduction, ER at 90° of abduction, and scapular-plane abduction, whereas ROM was 
      measured during shoulder flexion, abduction, and ER and internal rotation at 90° 
      of abduction both before and 1 year after SCR. PROs included American Shoulder 
      and Elbow Surgeons, Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index, and Disabilities of the 
      Arm, Shoulder and Hand surveys that were collected before and 1 year after SCR. 
      Synchronized biplane radiographs were collected at 50 images/s before and 1 year 
      after SCR while patients performed 3 trials of scapular-plane abduction. A 
      validated volumetric tracking technique with submillimeter accuracy determined 
      6-df glenohumeral and scapular kinematics. The acromiohumeral distance (AHD), 
      humeral head translation, and scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) were calculated from 
      the in vivo kinematics. Healing at 5 locations was evaluated on 1-year 
      postoperative MRI scans: anterior and posterior glenoid, anterior and posterior 
      humerus, and posteriorly along the infraspinatus. Each subject was given a score 
      from 0 to 5 based on number of sites healed. RESULTS: Of the 10 patients, 9 (90%) 
      had complete (n = 4) or partial (n = 5) healing of the graft whereas 1 (10%) had 
      complete failure at the glenoid. No correlation existed between MRI healing and 
      the AHD, SHR, strength, ROM, or PROs. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, 
      Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and 
      Hand scores all significantly improved from before to 1 year after SCR regardless 
      of graft healing. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of complete or partial graft healing on 
      MRI mimics findings of prior reports in the literature. MRI healing was 
      correlated with humeral head anterior-posterior translation but not with the 
      static and dynamic AHDs, SHR, humeral head superior-inferior translation, ROM, 
      strength, or PROs 1 year after SCR. All PROs improved significantly from before 
      to 1 year after SCR regardless of graft status on MRI. In vivo kinematic changes 
      were small after SCR and not clinically significant, and the data suggest that 
      improvements in clinical and functional outcomes may occur in the absence of full 
      graft healing.

AB  - The work describes and compares the conformation traits and gait characteristics 
      in the main native Iberian dressage Purebreds (Lusitano, Spanish and Menorca 
      horses). In total, 4 strides belonging to each of 66 males (4-14 years old) were 
      recorded at handled trot, using a 3D semi-automatic movement analysis system. 
      Principal component analysis (PCA) and intraclass Correlations (iC) were 
      computed. The Menorca Purebred showed proportionally higher limbs (23.8 and 
      15.1cm for the forelimb cannon and pastern lengths), the Lusitano Purebred had 
      larger inclinations (66.1°, 37.7° and 47.9° for the scapula and pastern angles), 
      and the Spanish Purebred presented a longer scapula (41.5 cm) and a larger hip 
      angle (132.1°), apparently showing a better conformation for dressage gaits. 
      However, the three breeds presented undesirable tarsus joint conformation 
      (<155.5°) for dressage performance. In general, all of them showed good features 
      in the kinematics of the forelimbs. Nevertheless, the functional capacity of 
      their hindlimbs and linear parameters probably need to be improved for their 
      competitiveness.

TI  - The reliability, minimal detectable change and construct validity of a clinical 
      measurement for identifying posterior shoulder tightness.
PG  - 208-19
AB  - PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Posterior shoulder tightness (PST) has been implicated in the 
      etiology of numerous shoulder disorders. Therefore, clinicians and researchers 
      must have a reliable and valid method for quantifying PST. The purpose of this 
      study was to investigate the interrater reliability, minimal detectable change at 
      the 90% confidence interval (MDC(90)) and construct validity of an inclinometric 
      measurement designed to quantify PST. METHODS: Two investigators each performed 
      sidelying PST measurements on the non-dominant shoulder of 45 asymptomatic 
      participants in a blinded repeated measures design. Upon completion of the PST 
      measurements, one rater assessed active internal and external rotation for the 
      validity component of the investigation. RESULTS: Interrater reliability using an 
      intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) model 2,k was good (ICC 5 0.90). The 
      MDC(90) indicated that a change of greater than or equal to 9 degrees would be 
      required to be 90% certain that a change in the measurement would not be the 
      result of inter-trial variability or measurement error. Construct validity was 
      evaluated using active internal rotation for convergence and external rotation 
      for discrimination. Construct validity was supported by a good to excellent 
      relationship between PST and internal rotation (r 5 0.88) and by an inverse 
      relationship between PST and external rotation (r 5 20.07). CONCLUSION: The 
      sidelying procedure described in this investigation appears to be a reliable and 
      valid means for quantifying PST when strict measurement protocols are adhered to. 
      An advantage of this procedure lies in the ability to control scapular position 
      to ensure motion is limited to the glenohumeral joint. Moreover, the use of 
      inclinometry provides an absolute angle of tightness that may be used for 
      intersubject comparison, documenting change, and to determine reference values. 
      Clinicians and researchers should consider the MDC values presented when 
      interpreting change values during subsequent measurement sessions.

TI  - Measures of accuracy for active shoulder movements at 3 different speeds with 
      kinesthetic and visual feedback.
PG  - 468-78
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Repeated-measures experiment. OBJECTIVE: To compare measures of end 
      point accuracy (EPA) for 2 feedback conditions: (1) visual and kinesthetic 
      feedback and (2) kinesthetic feedback alone, during shoulder movements, at 3 
      different speeds. BACKGROUND: Shoulder joint kinesthesia is typically reported 
      with EPA measures, such as constant error. Reporting multiple measures of EPA, 
      such as variable error and absolute error, could provide a more detailed 
      description of performance. METHODS AND MEASURES: Subjects were seated with the 
      shoulder abducted 90 degrees in the scapular plane and externally rotated 75 
      degrees, with the forearm placed in a custom shoulder wheel. Subjects internally 
      rotated the shoulder 27 degrees to a target position at 48 degrees of shoulder 
      external rotation for both conditions. Motion analysis was used to determine peak 
      angular velocity and 3 EPA measures for shoulder movements. Each EPA measure was 
      compared between the 2 feedback conditions and among the 3 speeds with a separate 
      2-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: Movements performed with kinesthetic 
      feedback alone, measured by constant error (P<.01), variable error (P<.01), and 
      absolute error (P<.01), were less accurate than movements performed with visual 
      and kinesthetic feedback. Faster movements were less accurate when measured by 
      constant error (P = .01) and absolute error (P<.01) than slower movements. 
      Subjects tended to overshoot the target in the absence of visual feedback; 
      however, movement speed played minimal role in the overshooting. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Multiple measures of EPA, such as constant, variable, and absolute error during 
      simple restricted shoulder movements may provide additional information regarding 
      the evaluation of a motor performance or identify different central nervous 
      system control mechanisms for joint kinesthesia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate deltoid and rotator cuff elongation in reverse shoulder 
      arthroplasty is crucial to maximize postoperative functional outcomes and to 
      avoid complications. Measurements of deltoid and rotator cuff elongation during 
      preoperative planning can support surgeons in selecting a suitable implant design 
      and position. Therefore, this study presented and evaluated a fully automated 
      method for measuring deltoid and rotator cuff elongation. METHODS: Complete 
      scapular and humeral models were extracted from computed tomography scans of 40 
      subjects. First, a statistical shape model of the complete humerus was created 
      and evaluated to identify the muscle attachment points. Next, a muscle wrapping 
      algorithm was developed to identify the muscle paths and to compute muscle 
      lengths and elongations after reverse shoulder arthroplasty implantation. The 
      accuracy of the muscle attachment points and the muscle elongation measurements 
      was evaluated for the 40 subjects by use of both complete and artificially 
      created partial humeral models. Additionally, the muscle elongation measurements 
      were evaluated for a set of 50 arthritic shoulder joints. Finally, a sensitivity 
      analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of implant positioning on deltoid 
      and rotator cuff elongation. RESULTS: For the complete humeral models, all muscle 
      attachment points were identified with a median error < 3.5 mm. For the partial 
      humeral models, the errors on the deltoid attachment point largely increased. 
      Furthermore, all muscle elongation measurements showed an error < 1 mm for 75% of 
      the subjects for both the complete and partial humeral models. For the arthritic 
      shoulder joints, the errors on the muscle elongation measurements were <2 mm for 
      75% of the subjects. Finally, the sensitivity analysis showed that muscle 
      elongations were affected by implant positioning. DISCUSSION: This study presents 
      an automated method for accurately measuring muscle elongations during 
      preoperative planning of shoulder arthroplasty. The results show that the 
      accuracy in measuring muscle elongations is higher than the accuracy in 
      indicating the muscle attachment points. Hence, muscle elongation measurements 
      are insensitive to the observed errors on the muscle attachment points. Related 
      to this finding, muscle elongations can be accurately measured for both a 
      complete humeral model and a partial humeral model. Because the presented method 
      also showed accurate results for arthritic shoulder joints, it can be used during 
      preoperative shoulder arthroplasty planning, in which typically only the proximal 
      humerus is present in the scan and in which bone arthropathy can be present. As 
      the muscle elongations are sensitive to implant positioning, surgeons can use the 
      muscle elongation measurements to refine their surgical plan.

AB  - The purpose was to compare glenohumeral (GH) migration, during dynamic shoulder 
      elevation and statically held positions using digital fluoroscopic videos (DFV). 
      Thirty male volunteers (25+/-4 years) without right shoulder pathology were 
      analyzed using DFV (30Hz) during arm elevation in the scapular plane. DFV were 
      obtained at the arm at side position, 45 degrees , 90 degrees , and 135 degrees 
      for static and dynamic conditions. GH migration was measured as the distance from 
      the center of the humeral head migrated superiorly or inferiorly relative to the 
      center of the glenoid fossa. Inter-rater reliability was considered good; ICC 
      (2,3) ranged from 0.83 to 0.92. A main effect was revealed for contraction type 
      (p=0.031), in which post-hoc t-tests revealed that humeral head was significantly 
      more superior on the glenoid fossa during dynamic contraction. A main effect was 
      also revealed for arm angle (p<0.001), in which post-hoc t-tests revealed 
      significantly more superior humeral head positioning at 45 degrees , 90 degrees , 
      and 135 degrees when compared to arm at side (p<0.001), as well as at 90 degrees 
      compared to 45 degrees (p=0.024). There was no interaction effect between angle 
      and contraction type (p=0.400). Research utilizing static imaging may 
      underestimate the amount of superior GH migration that occurs dynamically.

AB  - PURPOSE: To use the clinical prediction rule process to identify patient 
      variables, measured on initial clinical presentation, that would be predictive of 
      failure to achieve satisfactory improvement, while following a rehabilitation 
      program, in the modification of SLAP injury symptoms and dysfunction. METHODS: A 
      cohort of patients received the clinical diagnosis of a SLAP lesion based on 
      specific history and examination findings and/or magnetic resonance imaging. They 
      underwent a physical examination of the kinetic chain and shoulder, including 
      tests for labral injury. Patients followed a standardized physical therapy 
      program emphasizing restoration of demonstrated strength, flexibility, and 
      strength-balance deficits. At 6 weeks' follow-up, patients were re-evaluated and 
      divided into those recommended for surgery (RS) and those not recommended for 
      surgery (NRS). Bivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the best 
      combination of predictive factors. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (aged 39 ± 
      11 years, 45 men) were included. Of these, 31 (53%) were categorized as NRS and 
      27 (47%) as RS. The presence of a painful arc of motion (odds ratio, 3.95; P = 
      .024) and the presence of increased forward scapular posture (odds ratio, 1.27; 
      P = .094) on the injured side were predictive of being in the RS group. This 
      finding indicates that the odds of being in the RS group increased 4 times when a 
      positive painful arc was present and increased 27% with every 1-cm increase in 
      involved anterior shoulder posture. CONCLUSIONS: A structured rehabilitation 
      program resulted in modification of symptoms and improved function at 6 weeks' 
      follow-up in over half of patients in the study group. On initial evaluation, the 
      presence of a painful arc of overhead motion, indicating loss of normal 
      glenohumeral kinematics, and the presence of forward shoulder posture, indicating 
      an altered scapular position, represent negative predictive factors for success 
      of rehabilitation. Future validation of the model in a larger population is 
      necessary. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prospective comparative study.

TI  - Issues in relation to the repeatability of and correlation between EMG and Borg 
      scale assessments of neck muscle fatigue.
PG  - 452-65
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The repeatability of subjective and objective assessments of neck 
      muscle fatigue is very important with regard to the clinical applicability of 
      these methods. METHOD: To establish between-days reliability, 33 healthy 
      volunteers performed a 60% maximum voluntary isometric contraction test from a 
      standing position in all neck movements. Cervical muscle fatigue was assessed on 
      three separate occasions from the spectral (median frequency, MF) and amplitude 
      (root mean square, RMS) analysis of the electromyogram (EMG) signal recorded from 
      the cervical paraspinal group, splenius capitis, levator scapulae and 
      sternocleidomastoid. Subjective assessment of fatigue was rated by employing the 
      Borg scale. Intraclass correlation coefficient ICC((1,1)), standard error of 
      measurement (SEM), smallest detectable difference (SDD) indices and Pearson's 
      correlation co-efficient were calculated for the analysis of the results. 
      RESULTS: Normalised median frequency (MF) slope had low repeatability and large 
      between-day error (ICC((1,1))=0.28-0.61; SEM=0.33-0.60%/s; SDD=132.7-703.2%) for 
      the protagonist muscles of each movement. Initial median frequency (IMF) had 
      moderate to good reliability and small error (ICC((1,1))=0.64-0.81; 
      SEM=2.8-8.8Hz; SDD=19.9-38.5%). The RMS slope yielded also poor repeatability. 
      The Borg assessment was more reliable than the EMG estimate though variability 
      between sessions was still quite high (SDD=29.2-136.5%). No correlation was found 
      between the EMG and Borg assessment of neck muscle fatigue (r=-0.01-0.39). 
      CONCLUSION: The protocol used for assessing neck muscle fatigue proved to be 
      reliable only for the IMF but the clinical usefulness of this measure remains 
      questionable. The lack of correlation between objective and subjective estimation 
      of neck muscle fatigue was possibly a consequence of the poor measurement 
      repeatability. Further research is needed to identify the factors responsible for 
      these results on neck area.

AB  - For kinematic studies of the shoulder, electromagnetic sensors are commonly 
      placed on the humerus, scapula, and trunk. The trunk sensor is used to describe 
      humeral and scapular kinematics with respect to the trunk. There are two common 
      trunk sensor placements, the sternum or third thoracic vertebrae (T3). It is 
      currently unclear if placement of the trunk sensor affects kinematics, making it 
      difficult to compare data across studies. The purpose of this study was to 
      compare two trunk sensor placements (T3 and sternum) on trunk and scapular 
      kinematics during arm elevation. An electromagnetic tracking system was used to 
      collect kinematic data during five consecutive repetitions of ascending and 
      descending arm elevation in the sagittal plane. The results indicate that trunk 
      sensor placement had no significant effect on trunk kinematics or scapular 
      upward/downward rotation and internal/external rotation. Scapular 
      anterior/posterior tilt was significantly greater when the trunk sensor was on 
      the sternum compared to the T3 vertebrae during ascending 30°-120°: mean 
      difference = -3.51° (95%CI: -5.61, -1.40), and descending 120°-30°: mean 
      difference = -3.27° (95%CI: -6.07, -0.48). However, the difference in 
      anterior/posterior tilt did not exceed the error (minimal detectable change), and 
      thus is likely not a meaningful difference. These results indicate the trunk 
      sensors can be affixed on T3 or the sternum, depending on the needs of the study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ablation of locally advanced head and neck cancers generally results 
      in large composite oro-facial defects. Due to the often-large segment of mandible 
      missing, as well as the need to provide skin coverage and oral lining, 
      reconstructive options are limited. We present our experience in oncologic head 
      and neck reconstruction using chimaeric subscapular system free flaps. METHODS: 
      We performed a retrospective chart review of patients presenting important 
      through-and-through oro-facial defects following ablation of T3, T4a or T4b 
      tumours in two university centres between 2005 and 2011. All defects were 
      reconstructed with a subscapular system free flap that was harvested in a dorsal 
      decubitus position. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (15 M, 1 F; mean age=60 years) 
      underwent mandibular reconstruction with latissimus dorsi flaps with one or two 
      skin paddles and one bony component based on the angular branch of the 
      thoracodorsal artery. Fifteen patients received adjuvant radiotherapy. We 
      experienced no flap loss. Donor-site complications were minimal, albeit a 
      limitation of shoulder range of motion was found in four patients. Eight patients 
      presented postoperative complications requiring re-intervention. Fourteen 
      patients were able to recommence oral nutrition and their diction returned to 
      normal in all but one. The mean follow-up period was 25 months. Aesthetic results 
      were satisfactory upon atrophy of the latissimus dorsi muscle. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      cases of extensive oro-facial defects involving a large mandibular segment, 
      reconstruction with subscapular system free-tissue transfer is a safe and 
      reliable technique that offers satisfactory functional and aesthetic results.

TI  - Postural characteristics of adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis.
PG  - 218-24
LID - 10.1097/BPO.0b013e3181651bdc [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to compare the postural 
      characteristics of idiopathic scoliosis (IS) patients with different types of 
      spinal curvature and to compare a motion capture and a sequential digitization 
      technique to estimate the postural characteristics of the IS patients. METHODS: A 
      total of 57 IS patients underwent a radiological, clinical, and postural 
      geometric evaluations in an upright standing position as part of their regular 
      follow-up. The posteroanterior radiograph of the trunk was used to measure the 
      amplitude of spinal curvature. The postural evaluation was performed using a 
      motion capture and sequential digitization technique providing the necessary 
      3-dimensional positions of anatomical landmarks. These landmarks were used to 
      calculate postural parameters defining the position and orientation of the 
      pelvis, shoulders, and shoulder blades. These measurements included lateral shift 
      and angular measures of rotation and tilt. RESULTS: Significant differences in 
      the frontal and transverse planes were found between the right thoracic (RTh), 
      left thoracolumbar, and RTh-left lumbar (RThLL) patients. These characteristics 
      were most prominent in the transverse plane for RTh patients, in the frontal 
      plane for left thoracolumbar patients, and in the frontal and transverse planes 
      for the RThLL lumbar patients. A strong positive intraclass correlation was also 
      found between the parameters estimated with the motion capture system and with 
      the sequential digitization system. CONCLUSIONS: Unique postural characteristics 
      that are related to the type of the spinal curvature are evident in adolescents 
      who have IS. Further work is necessary to assess how these measures may be used 
      to monitor the progression of the spinal deformity. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 
      Quantifying the postural alignment of IS patients using surface anthropometric 
      landmarks provides an opportunity to characterize the unique postural attributes 
      that accompany each type of spinal curvature.

TI  - The Schulthess local Shoulder Arthroplasty Registry (SAR): cohort profile.
PG  - e040591
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040591 [doi]
LID - e040591
AB  - PURPOSE: Clinical registries are essential for evaluation of surgical outcomes. 
      The Schulthess Shoulder Arthroplasty Registry (SAR) was established in 2006 to 
      evaluate safety, function, quality-of-life and patient satisfaction in patients 
      undergoing shoulder arthroplasty. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients undergoing 
      anatomic or reverse shoulder joint replacement at the Schulthess Klinik, a 
      high-volume, leading orthopaedic surgery centre in Zürich, Switzerland. FINDINGS 
      TO DATE: Between March 2006 and December 2019, the registry covered 98% of 
      eligible operations. Overall, 2332 patients were enrolled with a total of 2796 
      operations and 11 147 person-years of follow-up. Mean age at baseline was 71 
      (range: 20-95), 65% were women. Most common indication was rotator cuff tears 
      with osteoarthritis (42%) and the mean preoperative Constant Score was 31 (±15). 
      The most frequent arthroplasty type was reverse, increasing from 61% in 2006-2010 
      to 86% in 2015-2019. Functional recovery peaked at 12-month postoperatively and 
      did not show a clinically relevant deterioration during the first ten follow-up 
      years. Since its establishment, the registry was used to address multiple 
      pertinent clinical and methodological questions. Primary focus was on comparing 
      different implant configurations (eg, glenosphere diameter) and surgical 
      techniques (eg, latissimus dorsi transfer) to maximise functional recovery. 
      Additionally, the cohort contributed to the determination of the clinical 
      relevance and validity of radiological monitoring of cortical bone resorption and 
      scapular notching. Finally, SAR data helped to demonstrate that returning to 
      sports was among key patient expectations after reverse shoulder arthroplasty. 
      FUTURE PLANS: As first patients are approaching the 15 years follow-up landmark, 
      the registry will continue providing essential data on long-term functional 
      outcomes, implant stability, revision rates and aetiologies as well as patient 
      satisfaction and quality-of-life. In addition to research and quality-control, 
      the cohort data will be brought back to the patients by bolstering real-time 
      clinical decision support.

TI  - Kinematic and EMG characteristics of simple shoulder movements with 
      proprioception and visual feedback.
PG  - 236-49
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if simple, shoulder movements use 
      the dual control hypothesis strategy, previously demonstrated with elbow 
      movements, and to see if this strategy also applies in the absence of visual 
      feedback. Twenty subjects were seated with their right arm abducted to 90 degrees 
      and externally rotated in the scapular plane. Subjects internally rotated to a 
      target position using a custom shoulder wheel at three different speeds with and 
      without visual feedback. Kinematics were collected with a motion analysis system 
      and electromyographic (EMG) recordings of the pectoralis major (PECT), 
      infraspinatus (INFRA), anterior and posterior (ADELT, PDELT) deltoid muscles were 
      used to evaluate muscle activity patterns during movements. Kinematics changed as 
      movement speed increased with less accuracy (p<0.01). Greater EMG activity was 
      observed in the PECT, PDELT, and INFRA with shorter durations for the ADELT, 
      PDELT and INFRA. Movements with only kinesthetic feedback were less accurate 
      (p<0.01) and performed faster (p<0.01) than movements with visual feedback. EMG 
      activity suggests no major difference in CNS control strategies in movements with 
      and without visual feedback. Greater resolution with visual feedback enables the 
      implementation of a dual control strategy, allowing greater movement velocity 
      while maintaining accuracy.

TI  - A Clinical Review of Return-to-Play Considerations After Anterior Shoulder 
      Dislocation.
PG  - 336-41
LID - 10.1177/1941738116651956 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Shoulder dislocations are common in contact sports, yet guidelines 
      regarding the best treatment strategy and time to return to play have not been 
      clearly defined. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Electronic databases, including PubMed, 
      MEDLINE, and Embase, were reviewed for the years 1980 through 2015. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Clinical review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. RESULTS: Much has been published 
      about return to play after anterior shoulder dislocation, but almost all is 
      derived from expert opinion and clinical experience rather than from 
      well-designed studies. Recommendations vary and differ depending on age, sex, 
      type of sport, position of the athlete, time in the sport's season, and 
      associated pathology. Despite a lack of consensus and specific recommendations, 
      there is agreement that before being allowed to return to sport, athletes should 
      be pain free and demonstrate symmetric shoulder and bilateral scapular strength, 
      with functional range of motion that allows sport-specific participation. Return 
      to play usually occurs 2 to 3 weeks from the time of injury. Athletes with 
      in-season shoulder instability returning to sport have demonstrated recurrence 
      rates ranging from 37% to 90%. Increased bone loss, recurrent instability, and 
      injury occurring near the end of season are all indications that may push 
      surgeons and athletes toward earlier surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: Most 
      athletes are able to return to play within 2 to 3 weeks but there is a high risk 
      of recurrent instability.

TI  - CLINICAL RELIABILITY AND DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY OF VISUAL SCAPULOHUMERAL MOVEMENT 
      EVALUATION IN DETECTING PATIENTS WITH SHOULDER IMPAIRMENT.
PG  - 456-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical investigation of shoulder injuries commonly utilizes visual 
      evaluation of scapular movement to determine if abnormal or asymmetrical 
      movements are related to the injury. To date, the intrarater reliability and 
      diagnostic accuracy of visual evaluation of scapular movement among physical 
      therapists are not known. PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to determine the 
      clinical reliability and diagnostic accuracy of physical therapists visual 
      evaluation of scapulohumeral movements when used to diagnose shoulder impairment. 
      STUDY DESIGN: University based laboratory and an internet based survey. METHODS: 
      Thirty-three physical therapists and 12 patient participants participated in this 
      study. Reliability was measured as percent agreement and using the free marginal 
      kappa statistic (κ) and Cronbach's alpha (α) for interrater and intrarater 
      reliability respectively. Diagnostic accuracy variables such as sensitivity, 
      specificity, likelihood ratios were calculated from contingency table analysis. 
      RESULTS: Visual evaluation yielded the following (95% CI): diagnostic accuracy 
      49.5%, specificity 60% (56 - 64), and sensitivity 35% (29 - 41), positive and 
      negative likelihood ratios were 0.87 (0.66 - 1.14) and 1.09 (0.92 - 1.27) 
      respectively. Percent agreements of evaluation findings between sessions for 
      static and dynamic symmetry were 69% and 68%, respectively. The alpha statistics 
      for static and dynamic symmetry were both 0.51. Percentage agreement in 
      determining the injured shoulder was 59%, with an alpha statistic of 0.35. 
      CONCLUSION: Visual evaluation of scapular movements, without additional clinical 
      information, demonstrated a poor to fair reliability and poor to fair diagnostic 
      accuracy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The clinical utility of the use of isolated visual 
      scapular evaluation is cautioned. More reliable and valid objective measures are 
      needed for diagnosing shoulder impairment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2b, Exploratory 
      cohort study.

TI  - Press-fit vs. cemented humeral stem fixation for reverse shoulder arthroplasty: 
      functional outcomes at a mean follow-up of 9.5 years.
PG  - 72-79
LID - S1058-2746(20)30406-7 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is a reliable, long-term 
      treatment option for degenerative shoulder pathology. However, the functional 
      outcomes degrade around the fifth year postoperation, particularly for internal 
      and external rotation. Long-term radiographic changes have been reported around 
      the humeral stem, depending on the fixation method. OBJECTIVES: The primary 
      objective was to compare the clinical outcomes of RSAs by fixation 
      method-cemented vs. press-fit-after a minimum follow-up of 5 years. We 
      hypothesized that proximal humeral osteolysis impacts the functional outcomes. 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: Our study compared 2 matched cohorts: 56 RSAs with cemented 
      stems and 56 RSAs with press-fit stems. We evaluated all the patients using the 
      Constant-Murley score (CMS) and range of motion (ROM), which we measured 
      preoperatively and at the final follow-up visit. We evaluated radiographs from 
      the final follow-up visit to look for proximal humeral osteolysis with tuberosity 
      resorption, signs of stress shielding, periprosthetic radiolucent lines, and 
      scapular notching. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 9.5 years (5-21), regardless 
      of the fixation method, the RSA procedure helped to improve the CMS and active 
      joint ROM postoperatively, except for internal and external rotation with elbow 
      at side in the press-fit group. Shoulder ROM was significantly better in the 
      group with cemented stems for anterior elevation (P < .001), abduction (P = 
      .006), and external (P = .02) and internal rotation with elbow at side (P = .02). 
      The CMS did not differ between groups. The presence of tuberosity resorption or 
      scapular notching had no effect on the CMS and active ROM in either group. 
      Osteopenia, which was more prevalent in the press-fit group, had no impact on the 
      functional outcome. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between 
      groups in the CMS, although the active shoulder ROM was significantly worse in 
      the press-fit group. This difference could be attributed to more frequent 
      tuberosity resorption in this group.

TI  - Tuberosity union in patients with proximal humerus fractures treated with reverse 
      shoulder arthroplasty: a technical note and exploratory analysis.
PG  - 2711-2717
LID - 10.1007/s00264-020-04831-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The use of reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) to treat complex humerus 
      fractures is increasing, especially in older, osteoporotic patients. Refixation 
      and tuberosity healing are needed to achieve an optimal range of motion (ROM), 
      external rotation, active forward elevation, and patient satisfaction. Proper 
      healing has been reported, however, in only 40-84% of cases. Our study's aim was 
      to describe a simple, reproducible fixation technique designed to improve 
      tuberosity healing. METHODS: We included 30 patients with acute proximal humerus 
      fractures undergoing RSA (Global Unite Reverse Fracture, DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, 
      IN, USA) with tuberosity reattachment. The humerus stem was cemented in 24 cases. 
      A standardized suture technique with two fiber tapes was used to reattach 
      tuberosities. Clinical and radiological parameters, which were collected one year 
      post-operatively, included ROM, pain level, Constant scores, subjective shoulder 
      value (SSV), and tuberosity healing. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 
      79.3 years (± 7; range 65-92), and the tuberosity healing rate was 90.0% (27 of 
      30). Two patients showed migration (one nonunion, one malunion), and another had 
      complete resorption after an initial period of proper healing. Radiolucent lines 
      around the humerus stem occurred in one case, and three patients had scapular 
      notching. The mean SSV was 86% (± 11; range 60-100), the Constant score was 72 
      (± 10.3; range 48-92), the active forward flexion was 140° (± 14.3; range 
      115-165), and external rotation was 23° (± 16.5; range 0-50). CONCLUSIONS: This 
      reattachment technique, which is simple and reproducible, achieved a higher 
      tuberosity healing rate than previously published rates.

TI  - Adjusting Implant Size and Position Can Improve Internal Rotation After Reverse 
      Total Shoulder Arthroplasty in a Three-dimensional Computational Model.
PG  - 198-204
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000001526 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Efforts during reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) have 
      typically focused on maximizing ROM in elevation and external rotation and 
      avoiding scapular notching. Improving internal rotation (IR) is often overlooked, 
      despite its importance for functional outcomes in terms of patient self-care and 
      hygiene. Although determinants of IR are multifactorial, it is unable to surpass 
      limits of bony impingement of the implant. Identifying implant configurations 
      that can reduce bony impingement in a computer model will help surgeons during 
      preoperative planning and also direct implant design and clinical research going 
      forward. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In a CT-modeling study, we asked: What reverse total 
      shoulder arthroplasty implant position improves the range of impingement free 
      internal rotation without compromising other motions (external rotation and 
      extension)? METHODS: CT images stored in a deidentified teaching database from 25 
      consecutive patients with Walch A1 glenoids underwent three-dimensional 
      templating for RSA. Each template used the same implant and configuration, which 
      consisted of an onlay humeral design and a 36-mm standard glenosphere. The 
      resulting constructs were virtually taken through ROM until bony impingement was 
      found. Variations were made in the RSA parameters of baseplate lateralization, 
      glenosphere size, glenosphere overhang, humeral version, and humeral neck-shaft 
      angle. Simulated ROM was repeated after each parameter was changed individually 
      and then again after combining multiple changes into a single configuration. The 
      impingement-free IR was calculated and compared between groups. We also evaluated 
      the effect on other ROM including external rotation and extension to ensure that 
      configurations with improvements in IR were not associated with losses in other 
      areas. RESULTS: Combining lateralization, inferiorization, varus neck-shaft 
      angle, increased glenosphere size, and increased humeral anteversion resulted in 
      a greater improvement in internal rotation than any single parameter change did 
      (median baseline IR: 85° [interquartile range 73° to 90°]; combined changes: 119° 
      [IQR 113° to 121°], median difference: 37° [IQR 32° to 43°]; p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: Increased glenosphere overhang, varus neck-shaft angle, and humeral 
      anteversion improved internal rotation in a computational model, while glenoid 
      lateralization alone did not. Combining these techniques led to the greatest 
      improvement in IR. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This computer model study showed that 
      various implant changes including inferiorization, varus neck-shaft angle, 
      increased glenosphere size, and increased humeral anteversion can be combined to 
      increase impingement-free IR. Surgeons can employ these currently available 
      implant configurations to improve IR when planning and performing RSA. These 
      findings support the need for further clinical studies validating the effect of 
      implant configuration on resultant IR.

TI  - The effects of localised fatigue on upper extremity jump shot kinematics and 
      kinetics in team handball.
PG  - 182-188
AB  - Team handball is a popular sport worldwide that requires numerous throws to be 
      made throughout the course of a game. Because of the upper extremity demands of 
      repetitive throwing, it is possible that fatigue can alter the mechanics of a 
      shot. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of localised 
      fatigue on jump shot kinematics and kinetics. Eleven male team handball players 
      (23.1 ± 3.1 years; 185.1 ± 8.3 cm; 89.7 ± 12.2 kg) volunteered. An 
      electromagnetic tracking system was used to examine the jump shot prior to and 
      following localised fatigue. The fatiguing protocol consisted of throwing a 
      2.2 kg medicine ball into a rebounder until volitional fatigue. No significant 
      kinematic or kinetic differences were observed following fatigue. Shoulder 
      external rotation was -74.8 ± 14.9° prior to and -79.0 ± 14.7° following fatigue 
      at MER. Scapula, external rotation at ball release (BR) prior to fatigue was 
      -2.2 ± 7.0° and -3.2 ± 11.1° following fatigue. Scapular internal rotation, at 
      maximum shoulder internal rotation (MIR), changed from 18.4 ± 11.2° to 
      20.4 ± 11.8°. Ball velocity decreased from19.8 m · s(-1) to 18.8 m · s(-1) 
      (P = 0.12). Accuracy percentage in the pre-fatigue trials was 60.8 ± 14.1% and 
      52.8 ± 12.7% following fatigue (P = 0.20). While no significant changes were 
      observed, it is possible that other fatiguing protocols that more closely 
      represent the aerobic and throwing demands of the sport may have a greater effect 
      on the kinematics and kinetics of the jump shot.

TI  - Revision arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: repair integrity and clinical outcome: 
      surgical technique.
PG  - 62-74
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.J.01173 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Literature regarding the outcomes of revision rotator cuff repair is 
      limited. The purposes of the present study were to report the tendon repair 
      integrity and clinical outcomes for a cohort of patients following revision 
      arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and to examine factors related to tendon healing 
      and the influence of healing on clinical outcomes. METHODS: Twenty-one of 
      twenty-nine consecutive revision arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs with a minimum 
      of two years of postoperative follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. Outcomes 
      were evaluated on the basis of a visual analog pain scale, the range of motion of 
      the shoulder, the Simple Shoulder Test, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons 
      score, and the Constant score. Ultrasonography was used to examine repair 
      integrity at a minimum of one year following surgery. Ten shoulders underwent 
      arthroscopic repair of a recurrent single-tendon posterior rotator cuff tear, 
      whereas eleven shoulders had repair of both the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. 
      RESULTS: The mean age of the twenty-one subjects was 55.6 years; thirteen 
      subjects were male and eight were female. Complete preoperative and postoperative 
      clinical data were available for nineteen subjects after an average duration of 
      follow-up of thirty-three months. Significant improvements were seen in terms of 
      postoperative pain (p < 0.05), the Simple Shoulder Test score (p < 0.05), the 
      American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons function (p < 0.05) and total scores (p < 
      0.05), active forward elevation (p < 0.05), and active external rotation (p < 
      0.05). Postoperative ultrasound data were available for all twenty-one shoulders 
      after a mean duration of follow-up of twenty-five months. Ten (48%) of the 
      twenty-one shoulders had an intact repair. Seven (70%) of the ten single-tendon 
      repairs were intact, compared with three (27%) of the eleven 
      supraspinatus/infraspinatus repairs (p = 0.05). Patient age (p < 0.05) and the 
      number of torn tendons (p = 0.05) had significant effects on postoperative tendon 
      repair integrity. Shoulders with an intact repair had better postoperative 
      Constant scores (p < 0.05) and scapular plane elevation strength (p < 0.05) in 
      comparison with those with a recurrent tear. CONCLUSIONS: Revision arthroscopic 
      rotator cuff repair results in reliable pain relief and improvement in shoulder 
      function in selected cases. Approximately half of the revision repairs can be 
      expected to be intact at a minimum of one year following surgery. Patient age and 
      the number of torn tendons are related to postoperative tendon integrity. The 
      postoperative integrity of the rotator cuff can have a significant influence on 
      shoulder abduction strength and the Constant score.

TI  - Assessing posterior shoulder contracture: the reliability and validity of 
      measuring glenohumeral joint horizontal adduction.
PG  - 375-80
AB  - CONTEXT: Increased contracture of the dominant posterior shoulder in throwing 
      athletes has been associated with the development of altered shoulder rotational 
      motion as well as several shoulder conditions. Clinicians must be able to 
      accurately and reliably measure posterior shoulder contractures during the 
      evaluation of such athletes in order to provide appropriate treatment. OBJECTIVE: 
      To evaluate the reliability and validity of assessing posterior shoulder 
      contracture by measuring supine glenohumeral (GH) horizontal adduction. DESIGN: 
      Descriptive with repeated measures. SETTING: The biomechanics laboratory at 
      Illinois State University (Normal, IL) and the athletic training room in 
      Surprise, AZ. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four shoulders were tested 
      in 12 subjects (age = 21.9 +/- 4.3 years, height = 175.0 +/- 10.0 cm, mass = 82.4 
      +/- 19.1 kg) for determination of reliability, and 46 shoulders were tested in 23 
      professional baseball pitchers (age = 21.25 +/- 1.66 years, height = 190.0 +/- 
      5.0 cm, mass = 88.45 +/- 6.99 kg) for determination of validity. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE(S): We examined intratester and intertester reliability over 3 testing 
      sessions by having 2 examiners measure GH horizontal adduction with the subject 
      in a supine position with the scapula stabilized. To determine the validity and 
      clinical usefulness of this measurement, we examined the relationship between GH 
      horizontal adduction motion and internal shoulder rotational motion among a group 
      of baseball pitchers. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients were high for 
      intratester (0.93, SEM = 1.64 degrees ) and intertester (0.91, SEM = 1.71 degrees 
      ) measurements. This measurement was also shown to have a moderate to good 
      relationship with lost internal shoulder rotational motion ( r = .72, P = .001) 
      of the dominant arm among the baseball pitchers. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the 
      results of this study, we found that measuring GH horizontal adduction with the 
      subject supine and the scapula stabilized is a reliable and valid technique for 
      assessing posterior shoulder contracture.

TI  - Real-Time Detection of Compensatory Patterns in Patients With Stroke to Reduce 
      Compensation During Robotic Rehabilitation Therapy.
PG  - 2630-2638
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2019.2963365 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Compensations are commonly employed by patients with stroke during 
      rehabilitation without therapist supervision, leading to suboptimal recovery 
      outcomes. This study investigated the feasibility of the real-time monitoring of 
      compensation in patients with stroke by using pressure distribution data and 
      machine learning algorithms. Whether trunk compensation can be reduced by 
      combining the online detection of compensation and haptic feedback of a 
      rehabilitation robot was also investigated. METHODS: Six patients with stroke did 
      three forms of reaching movements while pressure distribution data were recorded 
      as Dataset1. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained with features 
      extracted from Dataset1. Then, two other patients with stroke performed reaching 
      tasks, and the SVM classifier trained by Dataset1 was employed to classify the 
      compensatory patterns online. Based on the real-time monitoring of compensation, 
      a rehabilitation robot provided an assistive force to patients with stroke to 
      reduce compensations. RESULTS: Good classification performance (F1 score > 0.95) 
      was obtained in both offline and online compensation analysis using the SVM 
      classifier and pressure distribution data of patients with stroke. Based on the 
      real-time detection of compensatory patterns, the angles of trunk rotation, trunk 
      lean-forward and trunk-scapula elevation decreased by 46.95%, 32.35% and 23.75%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: High classification accuracies verified the feasibility 
      of detecting compensation in patients with stroke based on pressure distribution 
      data. Since the validity and reliability of the online detection of compensation 
      has been verified, this classifier can be incorporated into a rehabilitation 
      robot to reduce trunk compensations in patients with stroke.

TI  - Motor equivalence (ME) during reaching: is ME observable at the muscle level?
PG  - 145-75
AB  - The concept of motor equivalent combinations of arm muscles, or M-modes, was 
      investigated during reaching to insert a pointer into a cylindrical target with 
      and without an elbow perturbation. Five M-modes across 15 arm/scapula muscles 
      were identified by principal component analysis with factor extraction. The 
      relationship between small changes in the M-modes and changes in the 
      position/orientation of the pointer were investigated by linear regression 
      analyses. The results revealed a motor equivalent organization of the M-modes for 
      perturbed compared with non-perturbed reaches, both with respect to hand position 
      and orientation, especially in the first 100-ms postperturbation. Similar 
      findings were obtained for motor equivalence computed based on changes in the 
      joint configuration, although the kinematically defined motor equivalence was 
      stronger for pointer orientation. The results support the hypothesis that the 
      nervous system organizes muscles into M-modes and flexibly scales M-mode 
      activation to preserve stable values of variables directly related to performance 
      success.

TI  - A modified standardized nine hole peg test for valid and reliable kinematic 
      assessment of dexterity post-stroke.
PG  - 8
LID - 10.1186/s12984-019-0479-y [doi]
LID - 8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Impairments in dexterity after stroke are commonly assessed by the 
      Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT), where the only outcome variable is the time taken to 
      complete the test. We aimed to kinematically quantify and to compare the motor 
      performance of the NHPT in persons post-stroke and controls (discriminant 
      validity), to compare kinematics to clinical assessments of upper extremity 
      function (convergent validity), and to establish the within-session reliability. 
      METHODS: The NHPT was modified and standardized (S-NHPT) by 1) replacing the 
      original peg container with an additional identical nine hole pegboard, 2) adding 
      a specific order of which peg to pick, and 3) specifying to insert the peg taken 
      from the original pegboard into the corresponding hole of the target pegboard. 
      Eight optical cameras registered upper body kinematics of 30 persons post-stroke 
      and 41 controls during the S-NHPT. Four sequential phases of the task were 
      identified and analyzed for kinematic group differences. Clinical assessments 
      were performed. RESULTS: The stroke group performed the S-NHPT slower (total 
      movement time; mean diff 9.8 s, SE diff 1.4), less smoothly (number of movement 
      units; mean diff 0.4, SE diff 0.1) and less efficiently (path ratio; mean diff 
      0.05, SE diff 0.02), and used increased scapular/trunk movements (acromion 
      displacement; mean diff 15.7 mm, SE diff 3.5) than controls (P < 0.000, 
      r ≥ 0.32), indicating discriminant validity. The stroke group also spent a 
      significantly longer time grasping and releasing pegs relative to the transfer 
      phases of the task compared to controls. Within the stroke group, kinematics 
      correlated with time to complete the S-NHPT and the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (r(s) 
      0.38-0.70), suggesting convergent validity. Within-session reliability for the 
      S-NHPT was generally high to very high for both groups (ICCs 0.71-0.94). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The S-NHPT shows adequate discriminant validity, convergent validity 
      and within-session reliability. Standardization of the test facilitates kinematic 
      analysis of movement performance, which in turn enables identification of 
      differences in movement control between persons post-stroke and controls that may 
      otherwise not be captured through the traditional time-based NHPT. Future 
      research should ascertain further psychometric properties, e.g. sensitivity, of 
      the S-NHPT.

TI  - Effects of physical exercise in winter training conditions on the thermographic 
      temperature distribution of the horse rider's skin.
PG  - 133-137
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to assess the impact of a specific 
      equestrian training, conducted in winter weather conditions, on the thermovision 
      temperature distribution of a rider's body surface. The study included a riding 
      pair with 12 years of experience (female rider, aged 25, sports active and 
      16-year-old horse, Trakehner breed). METHODS: The study included the temperature 
      distribution of selected parts of the rider's body (the area of the right and 
      left shoulder blade, chest and lumbar section, and the region of the left and 
      right cross) was carried out before and after recreational, jumping and dressage 
      training. Each winter training has been repeated, at dif- ferent times, 10 times, 
      giving a total of 30 workouts. The thermovision measurements were made in a 
      separate room, always under the same conditions. RESULTS: Research has shown 
      that, along with the increase in the level and intensity of the training, the 
      body surface temperature of the rider increased. After recreational driving, this 
      temperature increased, compared to the pre-workout measurement, by 3.15°C, after 
      jumping through obstacles to 4.39°C, and in dressage to 5.82°C. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      highest increase in body surface temperature (on the example of dressage 
      training) was recorded in the thoracic and lumbar part of the spine region, then 
      in the area of the left and right scapula, while the smallest in the left and 
      right sacral region of the rider.

TI  - Shoulder complex linkage mechanism for humanlike musculoskeletal robot arms.
PG  - 066009
LID - 10.1088/1748-3190/10/6/066009 [doi]
AB  - The shoulder complex in the human body consists of the scapula, clavicle, 
      humerus, and thorax and bears the load imposed by arm movements while at the same 
      time realizing a wide range of motions. To mimic and exploit its role, several 
      musculoskeletal robot arms with shoulder complex mechanisms have been developed. 
      However, although many research groups have tried to design the structures using 
      links and joints that faithfully correspond to the bones and joints in the human 
      shoulder complex, its function has not been successfully reproduced because 
      biologically plausible designs seriously compromise engineering plausibility. In 
      this paper, we propose a linkage mechanism that can reproduce complex 
      three-dimensional scapulo movements and considers the trade-off between 
      biological and engineering plausibilities. Subsequently, the design was validated 
      by driving the mechanism using pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) placed 
      similarly to muscles in humans. Further, we present experiments in which the 
      robot was controlled by surface electromyographic signals from a human. We show 
      that the proposed design, due to its kinematic similarity with human 
      musculoskeletal systems, eases the conversion between the surface electromyogram 
      signals and the PAMs control inputs.

TI  - Prescribing upper limb exercises after stroke: a survey of current UK therapy 
      practice.
PG  - 212-8
LID - 10.2340/16501977-1268 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the current practice of physiotherapists and 
      occupational therapists in prescribing upper limb exercises to people after 
      stroke and to explore differences between professions and work settings. DESIGN: 
      A cross-sectional survey design. PARTICIPANTS: Occupational therapists and 
      physiotherapists working in UK stroke rehabilitation. RESULTS: The survey's 
      response rate was 21.0% (n = 322); with 295 valid responses. Almost two thirds of 
      therapists (64.7%, n = 191) agreed that they always prescribe upper limb 
      exercises to a person with stroke if they can actively elevate their scapula and 
      have grade 1 finger/wrist extension. Most therapists (98.6%, n = 278) prescribed 
      exercises to be completed outside of therapy time, with exercises verbally 
      communicated to family. Standardised upper limb specific outcome measures were 
      used to evaluate the prescribed exercises by 21.9% (n = 62) OF THERAPISTS. 
      DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN PROFESSIONS AND ACROSS WORK SETTINGS. CONCLUSION: 
      The majority of prescribed upper limb exercises were of low intensity (range of 
      motion or stretching exercises) rather than repetitive practice or strengthening 
      exercises. The use of standardised outcome measures was low. Progression of 
      exercises and the provision of written instructions on discharge occur less 
      frequently in inpatient settings than outpatient and community settings.

TI  - Results of spinal accessory to suprascapular nerve transfer in 110 patients with 
      complete palsy of the brachial plexus.
PG  - 990-5
LID - 10.3171/2015.8.SPINE15434 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE Transfer of the spinal accessory nerve to the suprascapular nerve is a 
      common procedure, performed to reestablish shoulder motion in patients with total 
      brachial plexus palsy. However, the results of this procedure remain largely 
      unknown. METHODS Over an 11-year period (2002-2012), 257 patients with total 
      brachial plexus palsy were operated upon in the authors' department by a single 
      surgeon and had the spinal accessory nerve transferred to the suprascapular 
      nerve. Among these, 110 had adequate follow-up and were included in this study. 
      Their average age was 26 years (SD 8.4 years), and the mean interval between 
      their injury and surgery was 5.2 months (SD 2.4 months). Prior to 2005, the 
      suprascapular and spinal accessory nerves were dissected through a classic 
      supraclavicular L-shape incision (n = 29). Afterward (n = 81), the spinal 
      accessory and suprascapular nerves were dissected via an oblique incision, 
      extending from the point at which the plexus crossed the clavicle to the anterior 
      border of the trapezius muscle. In 17 of these patients, because of clavicle 
      fractures or dislocation, scapular fractures or retroclavicular scarring, the 
      incision was extended by detaching the trapezius from the clavicle to expose the 
      suprascapular nerve at the suprascapular fossa. In all patients, the brachial 
      plexus was explored and elbow flexion reconstructed by root grafting (n = 95), 
      root grafting and phrenic nerve transfer (n = 6), phrenic nerve transfer (n = 1), 
      or third, fourth, and fifth intercostal nerve transfer. Postoperatively, patients 
      were followed for an average of 40 months (SD 13.7 months). RESULTS Failed 
      recovery, meaning less than 30° abduction, was observed in 10 (9%) of the 110 
      patients. The failure rate was 25% between 2002 and 2004, but dropped to 5% after 
      the staged/extended approach was introduced. The mean overall range of abduction 
      recovery was 58.5° (SD 26°). Comparing before and after distal suprascapular 
      nerve exploration (2005-2012), the range of abduction recovery was 45° (SD 25.1°) 
      versus 62° (SD 25.3°), respectively (p = 0.002). In patients who recovered at 
      least 30° of abduction, recovery of elbow flexion to at least an M3 level of 
      strength increased the range of abduction by an average of 13° (p = 0.01). Before 
      the extended approach, 2 (7%) of 29 patients recovered active external rotation 
      of 20° and 120°. With the staged/extended approach, 32 (40%) of 81 recovered some 
      degree of active external rotation. In these patients, the average range of 
      motion measured from the thorax was 87° (SD 40.6°). CONCLUSIONS In total palsies 
      of the brachial plexus, using the spinal accessory nerve for transfer to the 
      suprascapular nerve is reliable and provides some recovery of abduction for a 
      large majority of patients. In a few patients, a more extensive approach to 
      access the suprascapular nerve, including, if necessary, dissection in the 
      suprascapular fossa, may enhance outcomes.

PG  - 203-212
LID - 10.1016/j.jcm.2020.09.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to determine whether there are 
      differences between the dominant and nondominant arms for the Median Neurodynamic 
      Test 1 (MNT 1); whether there are differences between men and women on the MNT 1; 
      the reliability of an assessment of resting scapular position; the reliability of 
      the MNT 1; and the frequency and percentage of sensory responses that are present 
      during the MNT 1 in the asymptomatic population. METHODS: This was a reliability 
      and agreement study. It included asymptomatic students enrolled in the college of 
      health professions and the college of nursing at a university. The Mann-Whitney U 
      was used to determine whether there were any differences between the dominant and 
      nondominant sides and between sexes for elbow extension range of motion and for 
      sensory responses on the numeric pain rating scale when performing the MNT 1. A 
      χ(2) analysis was used to determine whether there were any differences between 
      sexes and between dominant and nondominant upper extremities for sensory-response 
      location, sensory-response type, and structural differentiation for raters 1 and 
      2. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC(2,3)) was used to determine the 
      intertester and intratester reliability for the degrees of elbow extension 
      attained during testing. RESULTS: Reliability for degrees of elbow extension and 
      strength of the sensory response was excellent (ICC(2,3) ˃ 0.75) and substantial 
      (κ ≥ 0.68), respectively. Resting scapular position and all other components of 
      the MNT 1 demonstrated statistically significant side-to-side differences and κ 
      values ranging from 0.23 to 0.88. CONCLUSION: Elbow extension and magnitude of 
      sensory response are reliable components of the MNT 1 that are not different 
      between the dominant and nondominant sides in the asymptomatic population.

TI  - Anatomical study of the perforator flap based on the acromial branch of the 
      thoraco-acromial artery (abTAA flap): a cadaveric study.
PG  - 1361-1367
LID - 10.1007/s00276-019-02322-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this anatomical study was to describe a local perforator 
      flap, for covering shoulder defects, by determining the features of the acromial 
      branch of the thoraco-acromial artery (abTAA), and the supplied cutaneous area. 
      METHODS: Thirteen fresh cadaveric thoraxes were dissected bilaterally. A precise 
      and reproducible protocol was performed. For each abTAA flap cadaveric 
      dissection, the following parameters were measured after arterial injection: 
      distances between the origin of the perforator artery on the abTAA and the 
      sternum, the acromion, the clavicle, diameter of the perforator artery of the 
      abTAA, length of the perforator pedicle course through major pectoralis muscle, 
      and rotation arc. We also calculated the surface of the injected skin paddle. 
      These measurements were related to morphometric parameters evaluated through the 
      distance between sternum and acromion. RESULTS: The mean distances measured from 
      the origin of the perforator artery on the abTAA were 14.25 cm to the sternum, 
      3.45 cm to the acromion, 5.65 cm to the clavicle. The mean diameter of the abTAA 
      was 1.20 mm ± 0.2. The arc of rotation was 180°, and the length of the perforator 
      pedicle could be extended to 7.46 cm ± 1.15. We observed an colored elliptical 
      cutaneous paddle with a longer radius 18 cm and a small radius 15 cm. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that this type of flap could be useful in 
      clinical practice for reconstruction and covering of the acromial area with a 
      thin cutaneous flap with low sequelae on the donor site.

TI  - Glenohumeral internal rotation measurements differ depending on stabilization 
      techniques.
PG  - 131-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The loss of glenohumeral internal rotation range of motion in 
      overhead athletes has been well documented in the literature. Several different 
      methods of assessing this measurement have been described, making comparison 
      between the results of studies difficult. HYPOTHESIS: Significant differences in 
      the amount of internal rotation range of motion exist when using different 
      methods of stabilization. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: 
      THREE TECHNIQUES WERE USED BILATERALLY IN RANDOM FASHION TO MEASURE GLENOHUMERAL 
      INTERNAL ROTATION RANGE OF MOTION: stabilization of the humeral head, 
      stabilization of the scapula, and visual inspection without stabilization. An 
      initial study on 20 asymptomatic participants was performed to determine the 
      intrarater and interrater reliability for each measurement technique. Once 
      complete, measurements were performed on 39 asymptomatic professional baseball 
      players to determine if a difference existed in measurement techniques and if 
      there was a significant side-to-side difference. A 2-way repeated-measures 
      analysis of variance was used. RESULTS: While interrater reliability was fair 
      between all 3 methods, scapular stabilization provided the best intrarater 
      reliability. A statistically significant difference was observed between all 3 
      methods (P < .001). Internal rotation was significantly less in the dominant 
      shoulder than in the nondominant shoulder (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Differences in 
      internal rotation range of motion measurements exist when using different 
      methods. The scapula stabilization method displayed the highest intrarater 
      reproducibility and should be considered when evaluating internal rotation 
      passive range of motion of the glenohumeral joint. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A 
      standardized method of measuring internal rotation range of motion is required to 
      accurately compare physical examinations of patients. The authors recommend the 
      use of the scapula stabilization method to assess internal rotation range of 
      motion by allowing normal glenohumeral arthrokinematics while stabilizing the 
      scapulothoracic articulation.

TI  - Air trapping and arboreal locomotor adaptation in primates: a review of 
      experiments on humans.
PG  - 149-59
AB  - A review was made of experiments on humans in which air trapping by glottis 
      closure during three-dimensional movements were examined in four subjects 
      including former Olympic gymnasts. In brachiation and horizontal bar exercises, 
      the behaviour of the larynx was monitored with a fiberoptic endoscope, and 
      EMG-data were recorded from shoulder muscles. The results revealed that 
      immobilization of the polyaxial connection between the shoulder girdle and the 
      thorax by air trapping occurs in phases of extreme loading of the upper limbs. 
      The closure of the airway by the larynx in humans serves three functions: first, 
      the prevention of errors in deglutition; second, the production of vocal sounds; 
      third, the retention of air inside the thoracic cavity. The latter function, air 
      trapping, allows the immobilization of the rib cage for the muscular fixation of 
      the shoulder blade on the trunk in movements that imply unusually high external 
      forces acting on the upper limbs. This morphological-functional innovation 
      probably has been made when early mammals invaded the three dimensional arboreal 
      habitat, because it gave the tree-dwelling early primates the device to anchor 
      themselves by the arms alone and to avoid falling out of trees. The specific 
      functional characteristic of primates is the hermetic closure of the vocal and 
      vestibular folds by rapidly contracting muscles in the folds. So the closure of 
      the glottis, which in humans seems primarily an adaptation to the production of 
      vocal tones, seems to go back to the adaptation of Tertiary arboreal primates to 
      movements in a three-dimensional environment. Our conclusions are in agreement 
      with the results of other contributions to this volume.

TI  - The reliability of upper limb kinematics in children with hemiplegic cerebral 
      palsy.
PG  - 568-75
LID - 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2011.01.011 [doi]
AB  - This study describes the reliability of a protocol for upper limb 
      three-dimensional movement analysis (UL-3DMA) in children with hemiplegic 
      cerebral palsy (HCP). The UL-3DMA is based on the ISB-recommendations, and 
      contains a set of functional and clinically relevant tasks. Tasks were selected 
      to reflect the characteristic movement deficits seen in children with HCP. The 
      protocol consists of three reach tasks (forwards, upwards, sideways); two 
      reach-to-grasp tasks (with objects requiring different hand orientations); and 
      three gross motor tasks. Within and between session reliability was tested in a 
      group of 12 children with HCP, aged 6-15 years. Reliability of movement 
      duration/speed and joint angles at endpoint was assessed with the intraclass 
      correlation coefficient; similarity of the waveforms with the coefficient of 
      multiple correlation. Measurement errors were calculated for all parameters. 
      Results indicated good within and between session reliability for movement 
      duration/speed. Trunk, scapula, shoulder, elbow and wrist angles at endpoint 
      generally showed moderately high to very high reliability. High levels of 
      reliability were also found for scapula, shoulder and elbow waveforms and lower 
      levels for the wrist and trunk. Within and between session measurement errors 
      were below 5° and 7°, respectively, for most kinematic parameters. Joint angles 
      in the transverse plane, as well as wrist flexion generally showed higher between 
      session errors (7-10°). This study indicates that the proposed protocol is a 
      reliable tool to quantify upper limb movements in children with HCP, providing a 
      sound base for its clinical application. Further research is needed to establish 
      the discriminative ability of the UL-3DMA.

AB  - REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: The function of the forelimb is fundamental to 
      understanding both sound and pathological locomotion. The precise movements of 
      the equine shoulder are hidden by layers of skin and muscle and hence the 
      shoulder is normally modelled as a simple pivot during locomotion which assumes 
      that any translational motion is negligible. OBJECTIVES: To record and quantify 
      the sliding motion of the scapula during locomotion, using a novel imaging 
      technique. METHODS: Scapula motion during locomotion in the horse was calculated 
      by tracking the ripple of the shoulder blade's movement under an array of markers 
      placed over the soft tissue. RESULTS: Interstride variability was low. Sliding of 
      up to 80 mm in the plane of progression (cranio-caudal) was observed; however, 
      the limits of motion varied by <5 mm in the gaits examined, despite variations in 
      stride length. Stride length appeared to be increased by scapula rotation in the 
      plane of progression, and this flexion-extension was largest in trot and was not 
      significantly different between walk and canter. This was in agreement with the 
      distance travelled by the trunk whilst the hoof was on the ground. Substantial 
      sliding in a dorsal-ventral direction was shown and varied with the gait used, 
      both in magnitude and timing, possibly providing a shock absorption mechanism. 
      The sliding did not increase as much as would be expected in canter and this 
      coincided with a more lateral positioning of the scapula and increased impact on 
      the ribcage. CONCLUSIONS: It has been assumed that scapula-thoracic sliding 
      increases stride length and hence economically increases locomotor speed. The 
      extra motion of the scapula recorded appeared to absorb shock from forelimb 
      impact and maintain the economy of locomotion, but did not increase with speed 
      and the muscular pretensioning implied could actually impair ventilation.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. INTRODUCTION: Rehabilitation interventions 
      are commonly prescribed for patients with shoulder pain, but it is unclear what 
      factors may help clinicians' prognosis for final outcomes. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: 
      The purpose of this study is to determine what factors are the best predictors of 
      improved patient-reported outcomes at discharge in patients with shoulder pain. 
      METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 128 patients presenting with shoulder pain 
      to an outpatient physical therapy clinic. Chart review captured data regarding 
      patient demographics, treatment interventions, patient history, and 
      patient-reported outcome scores. The primary dependent variable was the overall 
      change score of the QuickDASH (initial to discharge). Thirty-eight predictor 
      variables were entered into a forward stepwise multivariate linear regression 
      model to determine which variables and to what degree contributed to the 
      dependent variable. RESULTS: The linear regression model identified 5 predictor 
      variables that yielded an R = 0.74 and adjusted R(2) = 0.538 (P < .001). The 5 
      predictor variables identified in order of explained variance are QuickDASH 
      change at the fifth visit, a total number of visits, initial QuickDASH score, 
      scapular retraction exercise, and age. DISCUSSION: Early change scores, equal to 
      minimal detectable change scores on patient-reported outcomes appear to be strong 
      indicators that patients with shoulder pain are on a positive trajectory to 
      benefit from rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: Using patient-reported outcomes 
      throughout care, not just at the start and end of care, will provide therapist 
      feedback regarding patient's progress and indicate treatment effectiveness.

TI  - Measuring the motor output of the pontomedullary reticular formation in the 
      monkey: do stimulus-triggered averaging and stimulus trains produce comparable 
      results in the upper limbs?
PG  - 271-83
LID - 10.1007/s00221-010-2231-5 [doi]
AB  - The pontomedullary reticular formation (PMRF) of the monkey produces motor 
      outputs to both upper limbs. EMG effects evoked from stimulus-triggered averaging 
      (StimulusTA) were compared with effects from stimulus trains to determine whether 
      both stimulation methods produced comparable results. Flexor and extensor muscles 
      of scapulothoracic, shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints were studied bilaterally in 
      two male M. fascicularis monkeys trained to perform a bilateral reaching task. 
      The frequency of facilitation versus suppression responses evoked in the muscles 
      was compared between methods. Stimulus trains were more efficient (94% of PMRF 
      sites) in producing responses than StimulusTA (55%), and stimulus trains evoked 
      responses from more muscles per site than from StimulusTA. Facilitation (72%) was 
      more common from stimulus trains than StimulusTA (39%). In the overall results, a 
      bilateral reciprocal activation pattern of ipsilateral flexor and contralateral 
      extensor facilitation was evident for StimulusTA and stimulus trains. When the 
      comparison was restricted to cases where both methods produced a response in a 
      given muscle from the same site, agreement was very high, at 80%. For the 
      remaining 20%, discrepancies were accounted for mainly by facilitation from 
      stimulus trains when StimulusTA produced suppression, which was in agreement with 
      the under-representation of suppression in the stimulus train data as a whole. To 
      the extent that the stimulus train method may favor transmission through 
      polysynaptic pathways, these results suggest that polysynaptic pathways from the 
      PMRF more often produce facilitation in muscles that would typically demonstrate 
      suppression with StimulusTA.

TI  - Adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder joint: usefulness of dynamic sonography.
PG  - 445-9
AB  - We studied the value of dynamic sonography in adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder 
      joint in patients with clinically suspected frozen shoulder. The sonographic 
      criterion of adhesive capsulitis was continuous limitation of the sliding 
      movement of the supraspinatus tendon against the acromion of the scapula. 
      Arthrography was regarded as a gold standard in the diagnosis of adhesive 
      capsulitis against which the sonographic results were compared. Among 23 patients 
      with arthrographically documented adhesive capsulitis, sonographic examination 
      showed limitation of movement of the supraspinatus tendon in 21. This sonographic 
      sign therefore has a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy 
      of 92% for detecting adhesive capsulitis, making dynamic sonography a reliable 
      technique for the diagnosis of this condition.

TI  - Study protocol subacromial impingement syndrome: the identification of 
      pathophysiologic mechanisms (SISTIM).
PG  - 282
LID - 10.1186/1471-2474-12-282 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is the most common 
      diagnosed disorder of the shoulder in primary health care, but its aetiology is 
      unclear. Conservative treatment regimes focus at reduction of subacromial 
      inflammatory reactions or pathologic scapulohumeral motion patterns (intrinsic 
      aetiology). Long-lasting symptoms are often treated with surgery, which is 
      focused at enlarging the subacromial space by resection of the anterior part of 
      the acromion (based on extrinsic aetiology). Despite that acromionplasty is in 
      the top-10 of orthopaedic surgical procedures, there is no consensus on its 
      indications and reported results are variable (successful in 48-90%). We 
      hypothesize that the aetiology of SIS, i.e. an increase in subacromial pressure 
      or decrease of subacromial space, is multi-factorial. SIS can be the consequence 
      of pathologic scapulohumeral motion patterns leading to humerus cranialisation, 
      anatomical variations of the scapula and the humerus (e.g. hooked acromion), a 
      subacromial inflammatory reaction (e.g. due to overuse or micro-trauma), or 
      adjoining pathology (e.g. osteoarthritis in the acromion-clavicular-joint with 
      subacromial osteophytes).We believe patients should be treated according to their 
      predominant etiological mechanism(s). Therefore, the objective of our study is to 
      identify and discriminate etiological mechanisms occurring in SIS patients, in 
      order to develop tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. METHODS: In this 
      cross-sectional descriptive study, applied clinical and experimental methods to 
      identify intrinsic and extrinsic etiologic mechanisms comprise: MRI-arthrography 
      (eligibility criteria, cuff status, 3D-segmented bony contours); 3D-motion 
      tracking (scapulohumeral rhythm, arm range of motion, dynamic subacromial volume 
      assessment by combining the 3D bony contours and 3D-kinematics); EMG (adductor 
      co-activation) and dynamometry instrumented shoulder radiographs during arm tasks 
      (force and muscle activation controlled acromiohumeral translation assessments); 
      Clinical phenotyping (Constant Score, DASH, WORC, and SF-36 scores). DISCUSSION: 
      By relating anatomic properties, kinematics and muscle dynamics to subacromial 
      volume, we expect to identify one or more predominant pathophysiological 
      mechanisms in every SIS patient. These differences in underlying mechanisms are a 
      reflection of the variations in symptoms, clinical scores and outcomes reported 
      in literature. More insight in these mechanisms is necessary in order to optimize 
      future diagnostic and treatment strategies for patients with SIS symptoms. TRIAL

TI  - Comparison of Activity Monitors Accuracy in Assessing Intermittent Outdoor 
      Walking.
PG  - 1303-1314
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000002587 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine and compare the accuracy of different 
      activity monitors in assessing intermittent outdoor walking in both healthy and 
      clinical populations through the development and validation of processing 
      methodologies. METHODS: In study 1, an automated algorithm was implemented and 
      tested for the detection of short (≤1 min) walking and stopping bouts during 
      prescribed walking protocols performed by healthy subjects in environments with 
      low and high levels of obstruction. The following parameters obtained from 
      activity monitors were tested, with different recording 
      epochs0.1s/0.033s/1s/3s/10s and wearing locationsscapula/hip/wrist/ankle: 
      GlobalSat DG100 (GS) and Qstarz BT-Q1000XT/-Q1000eX (QS) speed; ActiGraph wGT3X+ 
      (AG) vector magnitude (VM) raw data, VM counts, and steps; and StepWatch3 (SW) 
      steps. Furthermore, linear mixed models were developed to estimate walking speeds 
      and distances from the monitors parameters. Study 2 validated the performance of 
      the activity monitors and processing methodologies in a clinical population 
      showing profile of intermittent walking due to functional limitations during 
      outdoor walking sessions. RESULTS: In study 1, GS1s, scapula, QS1s, scapula/wrist 
      speed, and AG0.033s, hip VM raw data provided the highest bout detection rates 
      (>96.7%) and the lowest root mean square errors in speed (≤0.4 km·h-1) and 
      distance (<18 m) estimation. Using SW3s, ankle steps, the root mean square error 
      for walking/stopping duration estimation reached 13.6 min using proprietary 
      software and 0.98 min using our algorithm (total recording duration, 282 min). In 
      study 2, using AG0.033s, hip VM raw data, the bout detection rate (95% confidence 
      interval) reached 100% (99%-100%), and the mean (SD) absolute percentage errors 
      in speed and distance estimation were 9% (6.6%) and 12.5% (7.9%), respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: GPS receivers and AG demonstrated high performance in assessing 
      intermittent outdoor walking in both healthy and clinical populations.

TI  - Ultrasound and magnetic resonance findings and correlation in hemiplegic patients 
      with shoulder pain.
PG  - S1-7
LID - 10.1310/tsr21S1-S1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasonography (US) and 
      MRI findings in hemiplegic patients with shoulder pain and investigate the 
      correlation between them. It is not possible for these patients to fully perform 
      active range of motion (ROM) and stress tests, so imaging methods take center 
      stage in diagnosis and treatment planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 68 
      hemiplegic patients with shoulder pain attending the inpatient rehabilitation 
      program were included in the study. MRI and US results from the patient files 
      were recorded. The frequency of each pathology identified by US and MRI was 
      determined. The distribution of MRI and US findings was investigated to see 
      whether there was a statistical difference between the correlation of MRI and US 
      results. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the patients was 63.7 (8.3) years and the 
      mean (SD) duration of hemiplegia was 49 (8.9) days. According to the MRI results, 
      glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint degeneration was found in 77.9% and 
      79.7% of the patients, respectively; subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis in 80.9%; 
      fluid increase in the joint space in 41.2%; supraspinatus tendinitis in 36.8%; 
      and supraspinatus partial rupture in 33.8%. Shoulder US findings were 
      supraspinatus tendinitis in 54.4%, acromioclavicular joint degeneration in 26.5%, 
      bicipital tendinitis in 20.6%, and subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis in 19.1%. 
      There was a statistically significant difference between MRI and US findings. The 
      results were not compatible with each other (P ≯ .05), and these findings were 
      not consistent with each other since the kappa coefficient was under 0.40 for all 
      these results. CONCLUSION: Although US is recommended as the first method in 
      determining shoulder pathologies in hemiplegic patients, we suggest that MRI 
      should be used as the first choice in hemiplegic patients with shoulder pain. MRI 
      and US findings were not consistent, and US is dependent on the experience of the 
      operator. MRI should be the first choice in cases where the diagnosis will affect 
      the treatment choice due to the lack of correlation between US and MRI findings.

TI  - Arthrodesis of the shoulder in rheumatoid arthritis: a review of forty-one cases.
PG  - 155-8
AB  - Forty-one arthrodeses of the shoulder in thirty-nine patients suffering from 
      rheumatoid arthritis (thirty women, nine men) have been reviewed. Using internal 
      fixation and external splints the position of the shoulder was maintained in 55 
      degrees of abduction, 25 degrees of horizontal flexion and enough internal 
      rotation to allow the patient to reach the mouth. The mean period of 
      immobilisation in a thoracobrachial splint was nine weeks, and 90 per cent of the 
      shoulders had solid bony fusion at review. After arthrodesis the total range of 
      scapulothoracic movement improved by about 60 per cent, giving results rated as 
      excellent in fifteen cases (36 per cent), as good in thirteen (32 per cent) and 
      as fair in thirteen (32 per cent). Arthrodesis can be recommended as an easy, 
      cheap and reliable method of treating a shoulder which has been severely 
      destroyed by rheumatoid arthritis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty has shown promising early and 
      midterm results; however, complication rates remain a concern. Glenoid loosening 
      and notching, for example, can be deleterious to the long-term success. A 15° 
      inferior inclination angle has been shown to offer the most uniform compressive 
      forces across the base plate and the least micromotion at the base plate-glenoid 
      interface. The inferior inclination angle may also avoid scapular notching. The 
      purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of obtaining 15° of inferior 
      inclination of the base plate. METHODS: The radiographs of 138 reverse total 
      shoulder patients were included. Overall, glenoid inclination and change in 
      inclination from preoperative radiographs were measured using a previously 
      described standardized method. Measurements were obtained by 2 orthopedic 
      surgeons, who repeated all measurements 3 weeks apart. The final angle and change 
      in inclination were averaged. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients had pre- and 
      postoperative radiographs of sufficient quality to accurately measure 
      inclination. Average pre- and postoperative inclination measured -4.8° (-27.2° to 
      28.1°) and -13.3° (-22.8° to 43.6°), respectively. The average change in 
      inclination was -8.5° (-53.7(o) to 34.6(o)). No scapular notching was observed, 
      which may relate to the lateralized center of rotation of the implant used in 
      this study. DISCUSSION: Overall, the average decrease in inclination was very 
      close to the intended target value using the standard guide. However, patients 
      with preoperative superior glenoid erosion from advanced rotator cuff tear 
      arthropathy appeared to be consistently tilted superiorly, suggesting the 
      standard guide may be inadequate in these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of altered joint mechanics on cartilage degeneration in in 
      vivo models has not been studied successfully due to a lack of pre-injury 
      information. We aimed 1) to develop an accurate in vivo canine model to measure 
      the changes in joint loading and T2 star (T2*) relaxation time before and after 
      unilateral supraspinatus tendon resections, and 2) to find the relationship 
      between regional variations in articular cartilage loading patterns and T2* 
      relaxation time distributions. METHODS: Rigid markers were implanted in the 
      scapula and humerus of tested dogs. The movement of the shoulder bones were 
      measured by a motion tracking system during normal gaits. In vivo cartilage 
      contact strain was measured by aligning 3D shoulder models with the motion 
      tracking data. Articular cartilage T2* relaxation times were measured by 
      quantitative MRI scans. Articular cartilage contact strain and T2* relaxation 
      time were compared in the shoulders before and 3 months after the supraspinatus 
      tendon resections. RESULTS: Excellent accuracy and reproducibility were found in 
      our in vivo contact strain measurements with less than 1% errors. Changes in 
      articular cartilage contact strain exhibited similar patterns with the changes in 
      the T2* relaxation time after resection surgeries. Regional changes in the 
      articular cartilage T2* relaxation time exhibited positive correlations with 
      regional contact strain variations 3 months after the supraspinatus resection 
      surgeries. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to measure in vivo articular 
      cartilage contact strains with high accuracy and reproducibility. Positive 
      correlations between contact strain and T2* relaxation time suggest that the 
      articular cartilage extracellular matrix may responds to mechanical changes in 
      local areas.

AB  - Cervical spine trauma from sport or traffic collisions can have devastating 
      consequences for individuals and a high societal cost. The precise mechanisms of 
      such injuries are still unknown as investigation is hampered by the difficulty in 
      experimentally replicating the conditions under which these injuries occur. We 
      harness the benefits of computer simulation to report on the creation and 
      validation of i) a generic musculoskeletal model (MASI) for the analyses of 
      cervical spine loading in healthy subjects, and ii) a population-specific version 
      of the model (Rugby Model), for investigating cervical spine injury mechanisms 
      during rugby activities. The musculoskeletal models were created in OpenSim, and 
      validated against in vivo data of a healthy subject and a rugby player performing 
      neck and upper limb movements. The novel aspects of the Rugby Model comprise i) 
      population-specific inertial properties and muscle parameters representing rugby 
      forward players, and ii) a custom scapula-clavicular joint that allows the 
      application of multiple external loads. We confirm the utility of the developed 
      generic and population-specific models via verification steps and validation of 
      kinematics, joint moments and neuromuscular activations during rugby scrummaging 
      and neck functional movements, which achieve results comparable with in vivo and 
      in vitro data. The Rugby Model was validated and used for the first time to 
      provide insight into anatomical loading and cervical spine injury mechanisms 
      related to rugby, whilst the MASI introduces a new computational tool to allow 
      investigation of spinal injuries arising from other sporting activities, 
      transport, and ergonomic applications. The models used in this study are freely 
      available at simtk.org and allow to integrate in silico analyses with 
      experimental approaches in injury prevention.

TI  - Dynamic upper limb proprioception in multidirectional shoulder instability.
PG  - 181-9
AB  - The ability of subjects with multidirectional shoulder instability to use 
      proprioception to complete a series of upper limb repositioning tasks was 
      investigated. Twelve subjects with multidirectional instability and 12 control 
      subjects were blindfolded and instructed to use proprioception to reproduce a 
      self-selected target position as accurately as possible. Subjects completed 10 
      repetitions for each limb using three distinct upper limb movements: overhead 
      reaching, scapular plane pointing, and humeral external rotation with abduction. 
      A three-dimensional video motion analysis system tracked limb position and 
      determined spatial hand position error. Subjects with multidirectional shoulder 
      instability showed significantly greater hand position error than control 
      subjects. No hand position error differences were found between the symptomatic 
      and the asymptomatic limbs of subjects in the instability group. Inter-repetition 
      error for subjects in both groups improved significantly during the first three 
      movement cycles. These results suggest that after movement initiation, dynamic 
      proprioception was a factor in improving hand position accuracy in both groups, 
      but to a lesser degree in subjects with multidirectional instability. 
      Consequently, subjects with multidirectional instability may have a reduced 
      capacity to use proprioception to refine and control the motor output of the 
      upper limb.

TI  - Implant Design Variations in Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty Influence the 
      Required Deltoid Force and Resultant Joint Load.
PG  - 3615-26
LID - 10.1007/s11999-015-4526-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) is widely used; however, 
      the effects of RTSA geometric parameters on joint and muscle loading, which 
      strongly influence implant survivorship and long-term function, are not well 
      understood. By investigating these parameters, it should be possible to 
      objectively optimize RTSA design and implantation technique. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: 
      The purposes of this study were to evaluate the effect of RTSA implant design 
      parameters on (1) the deltoid muscle forces required to produce abduction, and 
      (2) the magnitude of joint load and (3) the loading angle throughout this motion. 
      We also sought to determine how these parameters interacted. METHODS: Seven 
      cadaveric shoulders were tested using a muscle load-driven in vitro simulator to 
      achieve repeatable motions. The effects of three implant parameters-humeral 
      lateralization (0, 5, 10 mm), polyethylene thickness (3, 6, 9 mm), and 
      glenosphere lateralization (0, 5, 10 mm)-were assessed for the three outcomes: 
      deltoid muscle force required to produce abduction, magnitude of joint load, and 
      joint loading angle throughout abduction. RESULTS: Increasing humeral 
      lateralization decreased deltoid forces required for active abduction (0 mm: 68% 
      ± 8% [95% CI, 60%-76% body weight (BW)]; 10 mm: 65% ± 8% [95% CI, 58%-72 % BW]; p 
      = 0.022). Increasing glenosphere lateralization increased deltoid force (0 mm: 
      61% ± 8% [95% CI, 55%-68% BW]; 10 mm: 70% ± 11% [95% CI, 60%-81% BW]; p = 0.007) 
      and joint loads (0 mm: 53% ± 8% [95% CI, 46%-61% BW]; 10 mm: 70% ± 10% [95% CI, 
      61%-79% BW]; p < 0.001). Increasing polyethylene cup thickness increased deltoid 
      force (3 mm: 65% ± 8% [95% CI, 56%-73% BW]; 9 mm: 68% ± 8% [95% CI, 61%-75% BW]; 
      p = 0.03) and joint load (3 mm: 60% ± 8% [95% CI, 53%-67% BW]; 9 mm: 64% ± 10% 
      [95% CI, 56%-72% BW]; p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Humeral lateralization was the 
      only parameter that improved joint and muscle loading, whereas glenosphere 
      lateralization resulted in increased loads. Humeral lateralization may be a 
      useful implant parameter in countering some of the negative effects of 
      glenosphere lateralization, but this should not be considered the sole solution 
      for the negative effects of glenosphere lateralization. Overstuffing the 
      articulation with progressively thicker humeral polyethylene inserts produced 
      some adverse effects on deltoid muscle and joint loading. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 
      This systematic evaluation has determined that glenosphere lateralization 
      produces marked negative effects on loading outcomes; however, the importance of 
      avoiding scapular notching may outweigh these effects. Humeral lateralization's 
      ability to decrease the effects of glenosphere lateralization was promising but 
      further investigations are required to determine the effects of combined 
      lateralization on functional outcomes including range of motion.

TI  - A novel technique for determining scapulohumeral translation: a case-control and 
      inter-rater reliability study.
PG  - 39-48
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations in scapular and glenohumeral kinematics in patients with 
      shoulder dysfunction have been recognized by this studies authors' and described 
      in multiple other studies available in the literature. A reliability study was 
      developed to assess a new technique for measuring scapulohumeral kinematics. 
      Previous scapular position measuring techniques may require expensive equipment 
      which decreases clinical utility. Other techniques require identification of 
      multiple anatomic landmarks that may decrease accuracy, precision, and 
      reliability. METHODS: A sample of asymptomatic controls and symptomatic study 
      subjects were recruited. Each subject had markers placed on each acromion and 
      stood at a standardized distance in front of a light. The shadow projected from 
      the acromial marker onto a standardized, data collection board was measured 
      during the resting, flexion, and scaption positions for bilateral shoulders. The 
      horizontal and vertical translations of the shadows were measured compared to the 
      resting point for both flexion and scaption. RESULTS: The scapula translated 
      superiorly and medially during both flexion and scaption movements in all 
      subjects and controls. There was good inter-rater reliability for measuring 
      scapular translation with scaption (ICC= 0.81) and moderate reliability for 
      measuring scapular translation with flexion (ICC = 0.62). There was increased 
      superior and medial scapular translation in the subjects with flexion (p= 0.004 
      and p=0.002) and scaption (p= 0.01 and p=0.007) in the symptomatic shoulder 
      compared to the asymptomatic shoulder. Superior scapular translation with flexion 
      (p=0.0003) and scaption (p=0.006) and medial scapular translation with flexion 
      (p<0.0001) and scaption (p<0.0001) was greater in the symptomatic subjects 
      compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The scapula translates both superiorly and 
      medially with flexion and scaption in asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects. 
      After shoulder surgery, patients have increased superior and medial translation 
      of the scapula compared to 1) their asymptomatic shoulder and 2) an asymptomatic 
      control group. The current technique has good inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.81) 
      when measuring scaption and moderate reliability when measuring flexion 
      (ICC=0.62). LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III Diagnostic Case-Control Study.

TI  - Effect of supraspinatus deficiency on humerus translation and glenohumeral 
      contact force during abduction.
PG  - 645-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Supraspinatus deficiency is the most frequent and important problem 
      associated to rotator cuff pathologies. It reduces shoulder stability and can 
      lead to osteoarthritis. The goal of this study was to develop a numerical model 
      of the shoulder to analyse the biomechanical consequences of this pathology. 
      METHODS: A 3D finite element model of the shoulder was developed from a normal 
      cadaver specimen. It included the scapula, the humerus and the major abduction 
      muscles. Instead of the usual ball-socket assumption, which prevents the natural 
      translation of the humerus, shoulder stability was actively achieved by muscles. 
      A feedback algorithm was developed to synchronise muscle forces during abduction. 
      The numerical algorithm was validated against an algebraic model, and the 
      calculated muscle moment arms were compared to the literature. Two cases were 
      considered: a normal shoulder and the same one without supraspinatus. FINDINGS: 
      For the normal shoulder, the model predicted the initial upward migration of the 
      humeral head. The maximal humerus translation occurred at 30 degrees of abduction 
      and was 0.75 mm above its ideal centered position. Without supraspinatus, it was 
      1.6 times higher and the contact point in the glenoid fossa was more eccentric. 
      For the normal shoulder, the maximal glenohumeral force was 81% of the body 
      weight, at 82 degrees of abduction. Without supraspinatus, it increased by 8%, 
      while the increase of muscle forces was 30%. INTERPRETATION: Supraspinatus 
      deficiency increased the upward migration of the humerus, the eccentric loading, 
      and the joint and muscle forces, which may cause a limitation of active abduction 
      and degenerative glenohumeral changes (osteoarthritis and the rotator cuff tear).

TI  - Isokinetic and isometric measurement of strength of external rotation and 
      abduction of the shoulder.
PG  - 1320-33
AB  - The strength of active external rotation and of abduction of the shoulder when 
      the humerus was in the plane of the scapula (30 degrees of horizontal flexion 
      anterior to the coronal plane) was measured isokinetically and isometrically in 
      thirty-nine normal volunteers, who were stratified by age and sex. The angles at 
      which peak torque was produced were similar when tested isokinetically and 
      isometrically; these angles were similar for external rotation (at 60 and 30 
      degrees of internal rotation) and for abduction (at 30 and 60 degrees of 
      abduction). Isometric peak torque was greater than slow-speed (90 degrees per 
      second) isokinetic peak torque, which in turn was greater than fast-speed (210 
      degrees per second) isokinetic peak torque. There were highly significant 
      differences in strength, measured isokinetically and isometrically, between 
      younger and older men and between older men and older women. The variability of 
      normal values for torque was similar in each group. Repeat testing demonstrated a 
      high reliability of isokinetic measurements and of isometric measurements at 
      angles within the range of the production of peak torque. Complete testing was 
      performed in four normal volunteers before and after a block of the suprascapular 
      nerve. The supraspinatus and infraspinatus components of the rotator cuff 
      contributed a variable proportion to the total strength of abduction (25 to 50 
      per cent) and external rotation (50 to 75 per cent) throughout the range of 
      motion. This study demonstrated that both isokinetic and isometric testing in the 
      scapular plane are valid methods for measurement of the strength of external 
      rotation and abduction of the shoulder. The data support standardization of the 
      positions for testing the strength of motions of the shoulder: isometric strength 
      of external rotation should be measured in the scapular plane with the shoulder 
      in 45 degrees of abduction and 45 degrees of internal rotation; isometric 
      strength of abduction, in the scapular plane with the shoulder in 45 degrees of 
      abduction; and isokinetic strength of external rotation and abduction, in the 
      scapular plane at 90 degrees per second.

TI  - Stable laser-Doppler flow-motion patterns in the human cutaneous 
      microcirculation: Implications for prospective geroscience studies.
PG  - 134-144
LID - 10.1556/2060.2020.00013 [doi]
AB  - Microvascular function has been assessed by determining the rhythmic oscillations 
      in blood flow induced by the vasomotion of resistance vessels. Although 
      laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) allows simple, non-invasive evaluation of this 
      flow-motion in the cutaneous microcirculation, the temporal and spatial 
      reproducibility of such assessments remains unclear.In the present study, we 
      investigated cutaneous flow-motion in three consecutive years in eight skin 
      regions using LDF in six healthy young volunteers. The characteristic flow-motion 
      frequency was determined using fast-Fourier transformation. Additionally, in two 
      years a more traditional measure of microvascular reactivity, postocclusive 
      reactive hyperemia (PORH) was evoked in the forearm after transient brachial 
      artery occlusion (1-2-3 min) induced by cuff inflation.Well-defined flow-motion 
      was found in six regions showing significant differences in frequency: the 
      highest flow-motion frequency was found in the frontal and temporal regions (8.0 
      ± 1.1 and 8.5 ± 1.0 cycles/min, cpm, respectively, mean ± SD) followed by the 
      scapular, infraclavicular and coxal regions (7.5 ± 1.3; 6.7 ± 1.1 and 6.5 ± 1.2 
      cpm, respectively). The lowest, stable flow-motion was found in the posterior 
      femoral region (5.5 ± 1.0 cpm), whereas flow-motion was detectable only 
      sporadically in the limbs. The region-dependent flow-motion frequencies were very 
      stable within individuals either between the body sides, or among the three 
      measurements, only the infraclavicular region showed a small difference (114 ± 
      17%∗, % of value in 1st year; ∗P < 0.05). However, PORH indices differed after 
      2-3 min occlusions significantly in consecutive years.We report that flow-motion 
      frequencies determined from LDF signals show both region-specificity and 
      excellent intra-individual temporal and spatial reproducibility suggesting their 
      usefulness for non-invasive follow-up of microvascular reactivity.

TI  - Shoulder rhythm in patients with impingement and in controls: dynamic RSA during 
      active and passive abduction.
PG  - 456-64
LID - 10.3109/17453670903153543 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Impingement syndrome is probably the most common cause of 
      shoulder pain. Abnormal abduction and proximal humeral translation are associated 
      with this condition. We evaluated whether the relative distribution between 
      glenohumeral and scapular-trunk motions (the scapulohumeral rhythm) and the speed 
      of motion of the arm differed between patients with impingement and a control 
      group without shoulder symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 30 patients with shoulder 
      impingement (Neer stage 2) and 11 controls were studied during active abduction 
      and 21 patients and 9 controls were studied during passive abduction. Dynamic RSA 
      at a speed of 2 simultaneous exposures per second was used to record the shoulder 
      motions for 5-6 seconds. RESULTS: Within the interval statistically evaluated 
      (observations between 20-55 degrees of relative active abduction in the 
      glenohumeral joint), the patient group showed more scapular and trunk motions (p 
      = 0.04), especially at up to 40 degrees. The pattern of motion at passive 
      abduction was somewhat similar to that in the controls. Both controls and 
      patients showed an increasing absolute (i.e. global) proximal displacement of the 
      center of the humeral head with increasing active and passive abduction of the 
      glenohumeral joint and humerus, without any certain difference between the 
      groups. The mean maximum absolute proximal displacement in the patient and 
      control groups amounted to about 30 mm and 20 mm, respectively. The corresponding 
      relative displacement (with fixed scapula) was only 2.0 and 0.5 mm. Active 
      abduction was initiated with angular velocity of about 50 and 80 degrees per 
      second, respectively, in the patients and the controls. In both groups it 
      decreased with progressing abduction down to about 20 degrees per second 
      (controls) after 3 seconds without there being any statistically significant 
      difference. The angular velocities at passive abduction showed a similar pattern, 
      still without any difference. In both groups, the speed of proximal translation 
      during active abduction peaked 0.5-1 second later than the speed of rotation and 
      remained relatively even for about 1 second, followed by a deceleration. 
      INTERPRETATION: We found that the glenohumeral-thoracoscapular ratio during 
      abduction of the arm in our study, measured as the distribution of motion between 
      the glenohumeral joint and the trunk in both controls and patients with 
      impingement, was less than or equal to 1:1. This finding differs from earlier 
      results, probably due to the use of a method with high resolution and small 
      influence of motions out of the frontal plane. The reason for reduced 
      glenohumeral motions in the early phase of active abduction in the patient group 
      is uncertain, but pain or avoidance of pain elicited by the motion was probably 
      of importance.

TI  - Intertester reliability of a movement impairment-based classification system for 
      individuals with shoulder pain.
PG  - 51-62
LID - 10.1142/S1013702520500067 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Other than pathoanatomical diagnosis, physical therapy managements 
      need the diagnosis of movement-related impairments for guiding treatment 
      interventions. The classification system of the Movement System Impairment (MSI) 
      has been adopted to label the musculoskeletal disorders in physical therapy 
      practice. However, reliability study of this classification system in individuals 
      with shoulder pain has not been reported in the literature. OBJECTIVE: This paper 
      investigated the intertester reliability of the diagnosis based on the MSI 
      classification system in individuals with shoulder pain. METHODS: The patients 
      with shoulder pain, between the ages 18-60 years, were recruited if he or she had 
      pain between 30 and 70 on the 100 mm visual analog scale for at least three 
      months. The examiners who were two physical therapists with different clinical 
      experiences received a standardized training program. They independently examined 
      45 patients in random order. Each patient was examined by both therapists on the 
      same day. The standardized examination scheme based on the MSI approach was used. 
      Patients were identified to subgroup syndromes according to scapular and humeral 
      syndromes and also determining their subcategory syndromes. Six scapular 
      subcategory syndromes included downward rotated, depressed, abducted, wing, 
      internal rotated/anterior tilted, and elevated. Three humeral subcategory 
      syndromes were anterior glide, superior glide, and medial rotated. More than one 
      subgroup and subcategory of syndromes could be identified in each patient. The 
      test results of each session were blinded to another therapist. The percentages 
      of agreement and kappa statistic were determined. RESULTS: The results showed 
      that agreement levels in identifying subgroup syndromes was fair (71.11% 
      agreement, kappa coefficient =  0.34) and classifying subcategories syndromes 
      were poor to substantial (73.33-91.11% agreement, kappa coefficient =  0.20 -  
      0.66). The overall agreement and kappa value of the MSI classification of 
      subcategory syndromes was poor (kappa coefficient =  0.11; 95% CI 0.05-0.18). The 
      agreement level of subcategories for scapular depression and humeral superior 
      glide syndromes was substantial. The scapular winging, depression, and downward 
      rotation were the three syndromes that were most frequently identified by both 
      the examiners. CONCLUSION: The intertester reliability between therapists with 
      different experience according to the MSI approach for shoulder pain 
      classification was generally acceptable to poor due to the nature of the 
      classification system. The standardized procedure and intensive training can be 
      used for inculcating novice therapists with adequate level of intertester 
      reliability of examination.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the intra and interobserver reproducibility of a new 
      goniometric method for evaluating the isolated passive range of motion of the 
      glenohumeral joint in an outpatient setting. METHODS: This is a prospective 
      observational study on healthy subjects. The Glenohumeral ROM Assessment with 
      Scapular Pinch (GRASP) method is a new method for assessing the isolated range of 
      motion (ROM) of the glenohumeral joint (GH) by a single examiner with a clinical 
      goniometer. It measures the isolated glenohumeral passive abduction (GH-AB), 
      passive external rotation (GH-ER) and internal rotation (GH-IR) with the arm at 
      45º of abduction. These three GH ROM parameters were measured in both shoulders 
      of 30 healthy volunteers (15 males/15 females, mean age:41.6[SD = 10.3] years). 
      The full shoulder passive abduction, passive external rotation and internal 
      rotation 45º of abduction were measured by the same examiners with a goniometer 
      for comparison. One examiner made two evaluations and a second examiner made a 
      third one. The primary outcome was the intra- and interobserver reproducibility 
      of the measurements assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and 
      the Bland-Altman plot. RESULTS: The intra-observer ICC for isolated glenohumeral 
      ROM were: 0.84 ± 0.07 for GH-ABD, 0.63 ± 0.09 for GH-ER, and 0.61 ± 0.14 for 
      GH-IR. The inter-observer ICC for isolated glenohumeral ROM were: 0.86 ± 0.06 for 
      GH-ABD, 0.68 ± 0.12 for GH-ER, and 0.62 ± 0.14 for GH-IR. These results were 
      similar to those obtained for full shoulder ROM assessment with a goniometer. 
      CONCLUSION: The GRASP method is reproducible for quick assessment of isolated 
      glenohumeral ROM. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

TI  - Measuring dynamic in-vivo glenohumeral joint kinematics: technique and 
      preliminary results.
PG  - 711-4
AB  - Rotator cuff tears are a common injury that affect a significant percentage of 
      the population over age 60. Although it is widely believed that the rotator 
      cuff's primary function is to stabilize the humerus against the glenoid during 
      shoulder motion, accurately measuring the three-dimensional (3D) motion of the 
      shoulder's glenohumeral joint under in-vivo conditions has been a challenging 
      endeavor. In particular, conventional motion measurement techniques have 
      frequently been limited to static or two-dimensional (2D) analyses, and have 
      suffered from limited or unknown in-vivo accuracy. We have recently developed and 
      validated a new model-based tracking technique that is capable of accurately 
      measuring the 3D position and orientation of the scapula and humerus from biplane 
      X-ray images. Herein we demonstrate the in-vivo application of this technique for 
      accurately measuring glenohumeral joint translations during shoulder motion in 
      the repaired and contralateral shoulders of patients following rotator cuff 
      repair. Five male subjects were tested at 3-4 months following arthroscopic 
      rotator cuff repair. Superior-inferior humeral translation was measured during 
      elevation, and anterior-posterior humeral translation was measured during 
      external rotation in both the repaired and contralateral shoulders. The data 
      failed to detect statistically significant differences between the repaired and 
      contralateral shoulders in superior-inferior translation (p=0.74) or 
      anterior-posterior translation (p=0.77). The measurement technique overcomes the 
      limitations of conventional motion measurement techniques by providing accurate, 
      3D, in-vivo measures of glenohumeral joint motion during dynamic activities. 
      On-going research is using this technique to assess the effects of conservative 
      and surgical treatment of rotator cuff tears.

AB  - PURPOSE: Elevations in skin temperature and heat strain reduce tolerance to work 
      in the heat. This study assessed agreement between mean (eight sites) and 
      single-site skin temperature, measured by a conductive or infrared sensor, during 
      exercise in the heat. METHODS: Twelve males (age: 24.2 ± 3.7 years; height: 
      180 ± 6.5 cm; body mass: 82.9 ± 9.5 kg; body fat: 16.0 ± 6.5%) volunteered to 
      participate in two trials. Thirty minutes of seated rest was followed by 60 min 
      of treadmill walking (4.5 km·h(-1), 1%) inside an environmental chamber 
      (35.5 ± 0.2 °C dry bulb, 50.7 ± 2.5% relative humidity) wearing either an 
      athletic (ATH: t-shirt, shorts, shoes) or a chemical protective ensemble (CPE: 
      ATH plus coverall and respirator). Skin temperature was measured on the axilla 
      with a conductive sensor (T(sk-C)) and an infrared sensor (T(sk-I)) and compared 
      to mean skin temperature ([Formula: see text] 8-site conductive sensors). Rectal 
      temperature and heart rate were measured and used to calculate the adaptive 
      physiological strain index (aPSI). RESULTS: Skin temperature on the chest, 
      scapula, and thigh showed acceptable agreement with [Formula: see text] (mean 
      difference < 0.5 °C and limits of agreement ± 1.0 °C) in both ATH and CPE. Skin 
      temperature on the axilla overestimated [Formula: see text] in ATH (T(sk-C): 
      1.5 ± 0.8 °C; T(sk-I): 2.2 ± 1.2 °C) and CPE (T(sk-C): 1.1 ± 0.9 °C; T(sk-I): 
      1.8 ± 1.1 °C). Significant differences (p < 0.001) were observed in aPSI using 
      T(sk-I) (ATH: 5.7 ± 1.0, CPE: 8.3 ± 1.1) and T(sk-C) (ATH: 5.4 ± 1.0, CPE 
      7.8 ± 1.0) compared to [Formula: see text] (ATH: 5.2 ± 1.0, CPE: 7.4 ± 1.0). 
      CONCLUSION: The overestimate of mean skin temperature had a significant influence 
      on the aPSI, which has important implications for real-time monitoring and risk 
      management of personnel working in hot environments.

TI  - Kinematics of shoulder abduction in the scapular plane. On the influence of 
      abduction velocity and external load.
PG  - 137-143
AB  - In this paper the kinematics of arm abduction in the scapular plane of 38 healthy 
      experimental subjects is reported. The ratio of the glenohumoral and the 
      scapulothoracic components of the motion were determined and the influence of the 
      abduction speed and of the external load on it were investigated. The 
      investigation of the effect of abduction speed involved all 38 subjects. Each of 
      them performed one slow and one fast abduction. Statistical analysis showed that 
      there were large differences between individuals, but that for any one individual 
      the abduction process is essentially reproducible. For the one individual there 
      is a strong, linear relationship between glenohumeral and scapulothoracic 
      rotation. The slope of the regression of the glenohumeral component on total arm 
      abduction varied from 0.75 to 0.5 with a sample mean of 0.66. It means that only 
      two-thirds of arm abduction occurs in the glenohumeral joint, the remaining third 
      taking place via scapular rotation. In slowly performed abductions the slope of 
      the regression was significantly greater than in the high-speed movements, but 
      differences were very small. In the investigation of the effect of external load, 
      statistical analysis indicated that the slope of the intraindividual regression 
      is largely independent of the load. The possibility of observer bias was 
      analysed, too. It was found that the standard deviation of the abduction 
      parameters determined by different observers was between 6 and 10% of that 
      between different experimental subjects. RELEVANCE: A knowledge of the kinematics 
      of the shoulder joint is necessary to understand subacromial pathology and in 
      particular impingement problems. The scapulohumeral rhythm depends on the 
      balanced and coordinated function of the muscles involved. The activation pattern 
      of the abductor muscles, as reflected in shoulder kinematics, seems to be 
      individual and stored as an engram.

TI  - Clinical assessment and three-dimensional movement analysis: An integrated 
      approach for upper limb evaluation in children with unilateral cerebral palsy.
PG  - e0180196
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0180196 [doi]
LID - e0180196
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The clinical application of upper limb (UL) three-dimensional 
      movement analysis (3DMA) in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP) remains 
      challenging, despite its benefits compared to conventional clinical scales. 
      Moreover, knowledge on UL movement pathology and how this relates to clinical 
      parameters remains scarce. Therefore, we investigated UL kinematics across 
      different manual ability classification system (MACS) levels and explored the 
      relation between clinical and kinematic parameters in children with uCP. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: Fifty children (MACS: I = 15, II = 26, III = 9) underwent an UL 
      evaluation of sensorimotor impairments (grip force, muscle strength, muscle tone, 
      two-point discrimination, stereognosis), bimanual performance (Assisting Hand 
      Assessment, AHA), unimanual capacity (Melbourne Assessment 2, MA2) and UL-3DMA 
      during hand-to-head, hand-to-mouth and reach-to-grasp tasks. Global parameters 
      (Arm Profile Score (APS), duration, (timing of) maximum velocity, trajectory 
      straightness) and joint specific parameters (angles at task endpoint, ROM and Arm 
      Variable Scores (AVS)) were extracted. The APS and AVS refer respectively to the 
      total amount of movement pathology and movement deviations of wrist, elbow, 
      shoulder, scapula and trunk. RESULTS: Longer movement durations and increased APS 
      were found with higher MACS-levels (p<0.001). Increased APS was also associated 
      with more severe sensorimotor impairments (r = -0.30-(-0.73)) and with lower AHA 
      and MA2-scores (r = -0.50-(-0.86)). For the joint specific parameters, stronger 
      movement deviations distally were significantly associated with increased muscle 
      weakness (r = -0.32-(-0.74)) and muscle tone (r = 0.33-(-0.61)); proximal 
      movement deviations correlated only with muscle weakness (r = -0.35-0.59). 
      Regression analysis exposed grip force as the most important predictor for the 
      variability in APS (p<0.002). CONCLUSION: We found increased movement pathology 
      with increasing MACS-levels and demonstrated the adverse impact of especially 
      muscle weakness. The lower correlations suggest that 3DMA provides additional 
      information regarding UL motor function, particularly for the proximal joints. 
      Integrating both methods seems clinically meaningful to obtain a comprehensive 
      representation of all aspects of a child's UL functioning.

AB  - A major benefit of computational modeling in biomechanics research is its ability 
      to estimate internal muscular demands given limited input information. However, 
      several assumptions regarding model parameters and constraints may influence 
      model outputs. This research evaluated the influence of model parameter 
      variability, specifically muscle attachment locations and glenohumeral stability 
      thresholds, on predicted rotator cuff muscle force during internal and external 
      axial humeral rotation tasks. Additionally, relative sensitivity factors assessed 
      which parameters were more contributory to output variability. Modest model 
      parameter variation resulted in considerable variability in predicted force, with 
      origin-insertion locations being particularly influential. Specifically, the 
      scapula attachment site of the subscapularis muscle was important for modulating 
      predicted force, with sensitivity factors ranging from α=0.2 to 0.7 in a neutral 
      position. The largest variability in predicted forces was present for the 
      subscapularis muscle, with average differences of 33.0±9.6% of normalized muscle 
      force (1-99% CI), and a maximal difference of 51% in neutral exertions. 
      Infraspinatus and supraspinatus muscles elicited maximal differences of 15.0 and 
      20.6%, respectively, between confidence limits. Overall, origin and insertion 
      locations were most influential and thus incorporating geometric variation in the 
      prediction of rotator cuff muscle forces may provide more representative 
      population estimates.

TI  - Outcomes of arthroscopic Hill-Sachs remplissage and anterior Bankart repair: a 
      retrospective controlled study including ultrasound evaluation of posterior 
      capsulotenodesis and infraspinatus strength assessment.
PG  - 407-14
LID - 10.1177/0363546514559706 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hill-Sachs lesions are compression fractures that result from 
      shoulder dislocation. They involve "engaging" the humeral head on the anterior 
      glenoid rim when the arm is abducted and externally rotated. The defect grows as 
      the number of dislocations increases. HYPOTHESIS: Arthroscopic remplissage and 
      anterior Bankart repair do not significantly affect infraspinatus strength while 
      ensuring healing of the capsulotenodesis. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of 
      evidence, 3. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with traumatic anterior shoulder 
      instability treated by arthroscopic Bankart repair and Hill-Sachs remplissage at 
      least 24 months previously were compared with a control group of 40 healthy 
      participants. Preoperative imaging included magnetic resonance imaging for 
      Bankart lesion identification and computed tomography to quantify the humeral 
      head defect. Active range of motion and clinical scores (Walch-Duplay, 
      Constant-Murley, and Rowe) were assessed. External rotation (ER) and internal 
      rotation (IR) were measured with arm at the side (ER1 and IR1) and abducted at 
      90° (ER2 and IR2). Infraspinatus strength was assessed with the scapula free 
      (infraspinatus strength test [IST]) and retracted (infraspinatus scapula 
      retraction test [ISRT]). Infraspinatus tenodesis and posterior capsulodesis 
      healing were evaluated by ultrasound (US). RESULTS: The follow-up median was 39.5 
      months (range, 24-56 months). One patient experienced a recurrence of instability 
      at 34 months. In the remplissage patients, ER1 was significantly lower in the 
      affected compared with the unaffected shoulder (P < .001). Mean IST and ISRT 
      strength values did not show differences between sides. The mean Constant-Murley 
      score rose from 62.9 ± 7.1 to 90 ± 5.2 (P < .0001). The Walch-Duplay and Rowe 
      scores were excellent in 23 (78.6%), good in 6 (17.8%), and poor in 1 patient 
      (both scores). The remplissage group had significantly lower ER1 (P < .001), ER2 
      (P < .001), and IR2 (P < .01) values compared with the control group. Differences 
      in IST and ISRT between the groups were not significant. Capsulotenodesis healing 
      and filling of the Hill-Sachs defect were confirmed by dynamic US in all 
      subjects. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic remplissage is a reliable approach to 
      Hill-Sachs lesions. The ER and IR restriction does not significantly affect 
      quality of life. Infraspinatus strength recovery is satisfactory even compared 
      with healthy subjects. Ultrasound examination allows accurate evaluation of 
      capsulotenodesis healing.

TI  - Early follow-up of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty in patients sixty years of 
      age or younger.
PG  - 1877-83
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.L.10005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is an accepted treatment that 
      provides reproducible results in the treatment of shoulder arthritis and rotator 
      cuff deficiency. Concerns over the longevity of the prosthesis have resulted in 
      this procedure being reserved for the elderly. There are limited data in the 
      literature with regard to outcomes in younger patients. We report on the early 
      outcomes of RSA in a group of patients who were sixty years or younger and who 
      were followed for a minimum of two years. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter 
      review of sixty-six patients (sixty-seven RSAs) with a mean age of 52.2 years was 
      performed. The indications included rotator cuff insufficiency (twenty-nine), 
      massive rotator cuff disorder with osteoarthritis (eleven), failed primary 
      shoulder arthroplasty (nine), rheumatoid arthritis (six), posttraumatic arthritis 
      (four), and other diagnoses (eight). Forty-five shoulders (67%) had at least one 
      prior surgical intervention, and thirty-one shoulders (46%) had multiple prior 
      surgical procedures. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up time of 36.5 months, mean 
      active forward elevation of the arm as measured at the shoulder improved from 
      54.6° to 134.0° and average active external rotation improved from 10.0° to 
      19.6°. A total of 81% of patients were either very satisfied or satisfied. The 
      mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score and visual analog scale 
      (VAS) score for pain improved from 40.0 to 72.4 and 7.5 to 3.0, respectively. The 
      ability to achieve postoperative forward arm elevation of at least 100° was the 
      only significant predictor of overall patient satisfaction (p < 0.05) that was 
      identified in this group. There was a 15% complication rate postoperatively, and 
      twenty-nine shoulders (43%) had evidence of scapular notching at the time of the 
      latest follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: RSA as a reconstructive procedure improved 
      function at the time of short-term follow-up in our young patients with 
      glenohumeral arthritis and rotator cuff deficiency. Objective outcomes in our 
      patient cohort were similar to those in previously reported studies. However, 
      overall satisfaction was much lower in this patient population (81%) compared 
      with that in the older patient population as reported in the literature (90% to 
      96%).

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Before and after intervention trials. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the 
      effect of cervical muscular fatigue on joint position sense. SUMMARY OF 
      BACKGROUND DATA: Although fatigue-related degradation of proprioceptive acuity at 
      lower and upper limbs is well documented, to date no study has investigated 
      whether muscular fatigue induced at the neck could modify joint position sense. 
      METHODS: A total of 9 young healthy adults were asked to perform the 
      cervicocephalic relocation test to the neutral head position, that is, to 
      relocate the head on the trunk, as accurately as possible, after full active 
      cervical rotation to the left and right sides. This experimental task was 
      executed in 2 conditions of No fatigue and Fatigue of the scapula elevator 
      muscles. Absolute and variable errors were used to assess the cervical joint 
      repositioning accuracy and consistency, respectively. RESULTS: Less accurate and 
      less consistent repositioning performances were observed in Fatigue relative to 
      No fatigue condition, as indicated by increased absolute and variable errors, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Results of the present experiment evidence that 
      cervical joint position sense, assessed through the cervicocephalic relocation 
      test to the neutral head position, is degraded by muscular fatigue.

TI  - Kinetic chain abnormalities in the athletic shoulder.
PG  - 16-21
LID - 10.1097/JSA.0b013e31823a021f [doi]
AB  - Overhead activities require the shoulder to be exposed to and sustain repetitive 
      loads. The segmental activation of the body's links, known as the kinetic chain, 
      allows this to occur effectively. Proper muscle activation is achieved through 
      generation of energy from the central segment or core, which then transfers the 
      energy to the terminal links of the shoulder, elbow, and hand. The kinetic chain 
      is best characterized by 3 components: optimized anatomy, reproducible efficient 
      motor patterns, and the sequential generation of forces. However, tissue injury 
      and anatomic deficits such as weakness and/or tightness in the leg, pelvic core, 
      or scapular musculature can lead to overuse shoulder injuries. These injuries can 
      be prevented and maladaptations can be detected with a thorough understanding of 
      biomechanics of the kinetic chain as it relates to overhead activity.

AB  - Objective: To examine the short-term outcomes of modified load-sharing rip-stop 
      repair (mLSRS) and suture-bridge repair (SB) for large rotator cuff tear. 
      Methods: The clinical data of patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy for 
      large rotator cuff repair at Department of Orthopedic, China Academy of Chinese 
      Medical Sciences Wang Jing Hospital from January 2017 to December 2018 were 
      collected. Totally 111 patients (39 in mLSRS group and 72 in SB group) were 
      included in the study. There were 45 males and 66 females, aged (58.0±6.9)years 
      (range: 40 to 72 years).A total of 39 pairs of patients were successfully matched 
      by propensity score matching. The pain of shoulder joint was assessed by visual 
      analogy score (VAS) , the shoulder function was assessed by Constant-Murley 
      score, the abduction strength of bilateral shoulder joint was assessed by 90˚ 
      force assessment method of upper limb on the plane of scapula, and the healing of 
      rotator cuff on the operative side was assessed by sugaya ultrasonic 
      classification standard. The difference of short-term outcome between the two 
      groups were compared using t test, χ(2) test, Mann-Whitney U test, repeated 
      measures design anova and multivariate analysis of variance. Results: At the 4th 
      week after surgery, the VAS of mLSRS group was significantly lower than SB 
      group(1 (2) vs. 2 (2) , F=5.32, P=0.02). One year after surgery, Constant-Murley 
      score of two groups were significantly higher than those before surgery, but 
      there was no significant difference between two groups(89.1±5.7 vs. 87.6±7.3, 
      t=1.00, P=0.32). Abductor strength of affected limbs were lower than that of the 
      opposite side, but there were no statistically significant differences between 
      two groups(4.28±1.61 vs. 4.54±1.64, t=-0.70, P=0.49). According to the Sugaya 
      classification, 32 cases in mLSRS group were healed while 7 cases were not 
      healed,30 cases in SB group were healed while 9 cases were not healed(χ(2)=0.32, 
      P=0.58). Conclusion: The use of mLSRS fixation construct on large rotator cuff 
      tear can reduce pain and the short-term outcome is reliable.

TI  - Measuring 3D In-vivo Shoulder Kinematics using Biplanar Videoradiography.
LID - 10.3791/62210 [doi]
AB  - The shoulder is one of the human body's most complex joint systems, with motion 
      occurring through the coordinated actions of four individual joints, multiple 
      ligaments, and approximately 20 muscles. Unfortunately, shoulder pathologies 
      (e.g., rotator cuff tears, joint dislocations, arthritis) are common, resulting 
      in substantial pain, disability, and decreased quality of life. The specific 
      etiology for many of these pathologic conditions is not fully understood, but it 
      is generally accepted that shoulder pathology is often associated with altered 
      joint motion. Unfortunately, measuring shoulder motion with the necessary level 
      of accuracy to investigate motion-based hypotheses is not trivial. However, 
      radiographic-based motion measurement techniques have provided the advancement 
      necessary to investigate motion-based hypotheses and provide a mechanistic 
      understanding of shoulder function. Thus, the purpose of this article is to 
      describe the approaches for measuring shoulder motion using a custom biplanar 
      videoradiography system. The specific objectives of this article are to describe 
      the protocols to acquire biplanar videoradiographic images of the shoulder 
      complex, acquire CT scans, develop 3D bone models, locate anatomical landmarks, 
      track the position and orientation of the humerus, scapula, and torso from the 
      biplanar radiographic images, and calculate the kinematic outcome measures. In 
      addition, the article will describe special considerations unique to the shoulder 
      when measuring joint kinematics using this approach.

TI  - Shoulder arthrodesis for the treatment of brachial plexus palsy.
PG  - 250-8
AB  - In 14 adult patients with brachial plexus injuries, shoulder arthrodesis was 
      completed in a position of 30 degrees abduction, 30 degrees flexion, and 30 
      degrees internal rotation. Abduction was measured by the position of the arm in 
      relation to the side of the body with the scapula in the anatomic position. 
      Internal fixation was used in each case. Six patients had had Steindler 
      procedures. Three patients with complete paralysis were treated by above-elbow 
      amputation. All shoulders fused. Mean follow-up time was 32 months. All patients 
      noted that shoulder fusion had improved the function of their extremities. 
      Minimum shoulder motion was 60 degrees abduction and 50 degrees flexion. Three 
      procedures failed because of continued pain that was not relieved by surgery. One 
      patient with an elbow flexion contracture disliked the combination of shoulder 
      and elbow flexion. Seven patients required plate removal. Only one of the three 
      patients who had had above-elbow amputation became a good prosthetic user. 
      Shoulder arthrodesis is a reliable procedure that improves function in adult 
      patients with brachial plexus palsy.

TI  - Influence of trial repetition on lameness during force platform gait analysis in 
      a heterogeneous population of clinically lame dogs each trotting at its preferred 
      velocity.
PG  - 1284-1292
LID - 10.2460/ajvr.78.11.1284 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE To determine variance effects influencing ground reaction forces (GRFs) 
      in a heterogeneous population of lame dogs during trotting. ANIMALS 30 
      client-owned dogs with thoracic limb lameness and 31 dogs with pelvic limb 
      lameness. PROCEDURES GRFs, velocity, height at the dorsal aspect of the scapulae 
      (ie, withers), and shoulder height were obtained. Each dog was trotted across a 
      force platform at its preferred velocity. Variance effects for 12 velocity and 
      associated relative velocity (V*) ranges were examined. RESULTS Individual dog, 
      velocity, V*, and limb significantly influenced GRFs. Withers height V* ranges 
      were associated with small variance in GRFs, but all absolute and V* ranges were 
      associated with significant effects for all 4 limbs and both types of lameness. 
      Significant changes in lame limb GRFs and velocity in ipsilateral trials in dogs 
      with thoracic limb and pelvic limb lameness were evident with trial repetition. 
      Withers height V* range of 0.55 to 0.93 captured a large proportion of trials (> 
      90%) in dogs with thoracic limb or pelvic limb lameness, with limited effects on 
      peak vertical force and vertical impulse. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE 
      Trial repetition caused alterations to GRFs and subject velocity that may have 
      confounded assessment of lameness, which supported the concept that a priori 
      selection of a velocity or V* range for force platform gait analysis should use a 
      range that captures valid trials efficiently while minimizing GRF variance. These 
      ranges typically would span the preferred velocity of subject dogs, such as 
      withers height V* of 0.55 to 0.93.

TI  - Evaluation of a novel portable three-dimensional scapular kinematics assessment 
      system with inter and intraobserver reproducibility and normative data for 
      healthy adults.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the intra and interobserver reproducibility of a new system 
      that assesses the three-dimensional humero-scapulo-thoracic kinematics using 
      wearable technology in an outpatient setting. To obtain normative data with the 
      system for scapular angular motions in three planes. METHODS: The SHoW Motion 3D 
      kinematic tracking system is a motion analysis system that uses wireless wearable 
      non-invasive inertial-magnetic sensors to assess the three-dimensional kinematics 
      of the shoulder girdle. The sensors are placed over the skin in the sternum, 
      scapular spine and arm to precisely define angular motions of the humerus and the 
      scapula with three Degrees of Freedom (DOF) for each segment. The system was used 
      to measure the scapular angular motions in three planes (upward/downward 
      rotation, internal/external rotation and anterior/posterior tilt) during two 
      shoulder full-range movements (flexion/extension and abduction/abduction) in both 
      shoulders of 25 healthy volunteers (13 males and 12 females, mean age: 37 
      [standard deviation 11.1] years). In a first measuring session one examiner made 
      two evaluations alternating with another examiner that made a third evaluation. 
      In a second session, one week apart, the first examiner made a fourth evaluation. 
      A mean curve was computed from the normalized data for each measurement to obtain 
      normative data for scapular angular kinematics. Intra and inter-observer 
      reproducibility was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error Estimation (RMSE) and 
      Coefficients for Multiple Correlations (CMC). RESULTS: Both shoulders of the 25 
      volunteers were evaluated four times. The two hundred resulting kinematic 
      analyses were pooled to get normative values for relations between humeral 
      elevation angles and the three angular movements of the scapula. The system 
      showed at least very good (CMC > 0.90) intra and inter-observer reproducibility 
      for scapular tilt and upward-downward rotations both in flexion and abduction. 
      For scapular internal-external rotation the results were acceptable (CMC > 0.75) 
      but not as good, especially for the abduction movement. RMSE calculations showed 
      consistently good reproducibility with RSME< 4° for all three angles evaluated in 
      flexion and abduction. CONCLUSION: The SHoW Motion 3D kinematic tracking system 
      is a quick, reproducible and easy to use system for the assessment of scapular 
      angular kinematics in healthy adults. The data obtained is similar to that 
      obtained with other validated methods. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II. CLINICAL 
      RELEVANCE: The presented system is portable, easy to use and fast. It also has 
      good intra and inter-observer reproducibility, making it a good tool to assess 
      objectively scapular dyskinesis in the clinical setting. The normative data 
      obtained is consistent with previous information available.

TI  - Measurement of pectoralis minor muscle length: validation and clinical 
      application.
PG  - 169-74
LID - 10.2519/jospt.2008.2723 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Clinical measurement validity study. OBJECTIVES: To validate the 
      measurement of the pectoralis minor muscle length using palpable landmarks and to 
      explore the accuracy of the measurement using a clinical instrument. BACKGROUND: 
      The pectoralis minor is believed to adaptively shorten. Individuals with a 
      relatively short pectoralis minor demonstrate scapular kinematic alterations that 
      have been associated with shoulder impingement. METHODS AND MEASURES: A 
      3-dimensional electromagnetic motion capture system was used to calculate the 
      length of the pectoralis minor in 11 cadavers, using 2 measurement techniques. In 
      addition, a measurement with the electromagnetic system using palpable landmarks 
      was compared to a measurement with both a caliper and tape measure in vivo. 
      RESULTS: In cadavers, a measurement using palpable landmarks was determined to be 
      a valid measure of the actual muscle length visualized and measured following 
      dissection. There was a high intraclass correlation coefficient and a small 
      root-mean-square error between these 2 measures. High intraclass correlation 
      coefficients were also calculated in vivo when measurements with the clinical 
      instruments were compared with the electromagnetic device measures. CONCLUSION: A 
      measurement using palpable landmarks for pectoralis minor length validly 
      represents the muscle length in cadavers. A caliper or tape measure may be used 
      clinically with high accuracy and may help clinicians determine the need for and 
      the effectiveness of interventions for lengthening this muscle.

TI  - Mapping intended spinal site of care from the upright to prone position: an 
      interexaminer reliability study.
PG  - 20
LID - 10.1186/2045-709X-22-20 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Upright examination procedures like radiology, thermography, manual 
      muscle testing, and spinal motion palpation may lead to spinal interventions with 
      the patient prone. The reliability and accuracy of mapping upright examination 
      findings to the prone position is unknown. This study had 2 primary goals: (1) 
      investigate how erroneous spine-scapular landmark associations may lead to errors 
      in treating and charting spine levels; and (2) study the interexaminer 
      reliability of a novel method for mapping upright spinal sites to the prone 
      position. METHODS: Experiment 1 was a thought experiment exploring the 
      consequences of depending on the erroneous landmark association of the inferior 
      scapular tip with the T7 spinous process upright and T6 spinous process prone 
      (relatively recent studies suggest these levels are T8 and T9, respectively). 
      This allowed deduction of targeting and charting errors. In experiment 2, 10 
      examiners (2 experienced, 8 novice) used an index finger to maintain contact with 
      a mid-thoracic spinous process as each of 2 participants slowly moved from the 
      upright to the prone position. Interexaminer reliability was assessed by 
      computing Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, standard error of the mean, root 
      mean squared error, and the absolute value of the mean difference for each 
      examiner from the 10 examiner mean for each of the 2 participants. RESULTS: The 
      thought experiment suggesting that using the (inaccurate) scapular tip landmark 
      rule would result in a 3 level targeting and charting error when radiological 
      findings are mapped to the prone position. Physical upright exam procedures like 
      motion palpation would result in a 2 level targeting error for intervention, and 
      a 3 level error for charting. The reliability experiment showed examiners 
      accurately maintained contact with the same thoracic spinous process as the 
      participant went from upright to prone, ICC (2,1) = 0.83. CONCLUSIONS: As manual 
      therapists, the authors have emphasized how targeting errors may impact upon 
      manual care of the spine. Practitioners in other fields that need to accurately 
      locate spinal levels, such as acupuncture and anesthesiology, would also be 
      expected to draw important conclusions from these findings.

TI  - The variability of shoulder motions recorded by means of palpation.
PG  - 461-472
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this methodological study is the quantification of 
      the sources of variability in the recorded three-dimensional motions of the 
      shoulder mechanism for comparative purposes. BACKGROUND: The palpation and 
      subsequent digitization of skeletal landmarks of the shoulder mechanism is a 
      non-invasive and relatively easy method to quantify shoulder orientations. 
      Comparison of individual motions is subject to the accuracy of the palpation 
      method, the magnitude of kinematic redundancy of the shoulder mechanism and 
      inter-subject differences in morphology and physiology. Quantification of these 
      sources of variance, i.e. the palpation error, motoric noise and inter-subject 
      differences, demonstrated the accuracy of the method and the potential validity 
      of the descriptive motion parameters, e.g. Cardan angles, in intra- and 
      inter-individual studies for clinical, ergonomical and biomechanical studies. 
      METHODS: The orientations of the shoulder bones were recorded five times for each 
      of five subjects by palpation and digitization of 12 skeletal landmarks for 10 
      equidistant arm elevation postures in the scapular plane. The orientations were 
      described by means of Cardan angles. The palpation error was determined at a 
      standardized initial rest position and expressed by Cardan angles for each 
      recorded posture. Adding motoric noise and inter-subject differences gave the 
      inter-individual variance. RESULTS: The palpation error was approximately 2 
      degrees. The major recorded variance originated from motoric noise (+/-33%) and 
      inter-subject difference (+/-55%). CONCLUSIONS: The palpation method is an 
      accurate means of recording the three-dimensional orientations of the shoulder 
      mechanism and for intra-individual studies. However, inter-subject variability is 
      large.

TI  - Clinical management of scapulothoracic bursitis and the snapping scapula.
PG  - 147-55
AB  - CONTEXT: Symptomatic scapulothoracic bursitis and crepitus are disorders of the 
      scapulothoracic articulation that are often poorly understood. They can be a 
      source of persistent pain and dysfunction in the active overhead throwing 
      athlete. It is important to distinguish between scapulothoracic bursitis and 
      scapulothoracic crepitus. Scapulothoracic bursitis refers to inflammation of the 
      bursae secondary to trauma or overuse owing to sports activities or work. 
      Scapulothoracic crepitus is defined by a grinding, popping, or thumping sound or 
      sensation secondary to abnormal scapulothoracic motion. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: 
      This article presents the causes, diagnosis, and management of these shoulder 
      conditions in a manner that is relevant to clinicians, athletic trainers, and 
      physical therapists, and it reviews relevant studies to determine the consensus 
      on nonoperative treatment, as well as open and arthroscopic surgical treatment. 
      RESULTS: The causes of scapulothoracic bursitis and crepitus include direct or 
      indirect trauma, overuse syndromes, glenohumeral joint dysfunction, osseous 
      abnormalities, muscle atrophy or fibrosis, and idiopathic causes. Scapulothoracic 
      bursitis and crepitus remain primarily clinical diagnoses; however, imaging 
      studies or local injections may also be helpful. The initial treatment of 
      scapulothoracic bursitis and scapulothoracic crepitus should be nonoperative. 
      Surgical treatment options include partial scapulectomy or resection of the 
      superomedial angle of the scapula, open bursal resection, and arthroscopic 
      bursectomy. Despite the lack of agreement among orthopaedic surgeons concerning 
      which procedure is best for treating symptomatic scapulothoracic bursitis and 
      crepitus, most reports have demonstrated good to excellent outcomes in a 
      significantly high percentage of patients. CONCLUSION: Clearly, the best initial 
      approach to these conditions is a nonoperative treatment plan that combines 
      scapular strengthening, postural reeducation, and core strength endurance. The 
      addition of local modalities, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, and 
      localized injections may also be helpful. If an appropriate trial of nonoperative 
      management proves unsuccessful, surgical correction can produce good results.

LID - 10.1123/jab.2019-0247 [doi]
AB  - Altered scapular movement in subacromial pain syndrome has been demonstrated 
      using discrete data reduction approach. However, this approach does not consider 
      the data collinearity and variability, and scapular translations are poorly 
      investigated in symptomatic individuals. The purpose of this study was to 
      investigate the scapular rotation and translation of asymptomatic individuals and 
      those with subacromial pain syndrome during arm motions using principal component 
      analysis. Scapulothoracic kinematics were evaluated in 47 participants with 
      subacromial pain syndrome and 50 asymptomatic individuals. The symptomatic group 
      had increased range of scapular anterior/posterior tilt during arm elevation (P = 
      .01, effect size = .59) and arm lowering (P < .01, effect size = .61), and 
      increased range of scapular forward/backward translation during arm lowering (P < 
      .01, effect size = .60) compared with the asymptomatic group. In addition, the 
      symptomatic group had a reduced difference in anterior tilt angular velocities 
      between the early-arm and mid-arm lowering phases and between the mid- and 
      late-arm lowering phases compared with the asymptomatic group (P = .03, effect 
      size = .44). This study demonstrated that scapular anterior/posterior tilt motion 
      and angular velocity and scapular forward/backward translation of symptomatic 
      individuals were different from asymptomatic individuals when considering the 
      entire arm movement.

TI  - Collecting shoulder kinematics with electromagnetic tracking systems and digital 
      inclinometers: A review.
PG  - 783-94
LID - 10.5312/wjo.v6.i10.783 [doi]
AB  - The shoulder complex presents unique challenges for measuring motion as the 
      scapula, unlike any other bony segment in the body, glides and rotates underneath 
      layers of soft tissue and skin. The ability for clinicians and researchers to 
      collect meaningful kinematic data is dependent on the reliability and validity of 
      the instrumentation utilized. The aim of this study was to review the relevant 
      literature pertaining to the reliability and validity of electromagnetic tracking 
      systems (ETS) and digital inclinometers for assessing shoulder complex motion. 
      Advances in technology have led to the development of biomechanical 
      instrumentation, like ETS, that allow for the collection of three-dimensional 
      kinematic data. The existing evidence has demonstrated that ETS are reliable and 
      valid instruments for collecting static and dynamic kinematic data of the 
      shoulder complex. Similarly, digital inclinometers have become increasingly 
      popular among clinicians due to their cost effectiveness and practical use in the 
      clinical setting. The existing evidence supports the use of digital inclinometers 
      for the collection of shoulder complex kinematics as these instruments have been 
      demonstrated to yield acceptable reliability and validity. While digital 
      inclinometers pose a disadvantage to ETS regarding accuracy, precision, and are 
      limited to two-dimensional and static measurements, this instrument provides 
      clinically meaningful data that allow clinicians and researchers the ability to 
      measure, monitor, and compare shoulder complex kinematics.

TI  - Wheelchair Pressure Ulcer Prevention Using FBG Based Sensing Devices.
LID - 10.3390/s20010212 [doi]
LID - 212
AB  - In this work, a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based sensing system for wheelchair 
      pressure ulcer prevention was developed. Six FBGs were strategically positioned 
      in a wheelchair to monitor the more prominent bone areas, namely scapulas (right 
      (SR) and left (SL)), ischiatic zone (right (IR) and left (IL)), and heels (right 
      (HR) and left (HL)). The sensing architecture was tested by a female user during 
      pressure relief exercises, to verify its effectiveness on pressure monitoring. 
      The proposed system proves to be a compact and reliable solution for wheelchair 
      pressure ulcer prevention, making it a suitable alternative to existing 
      conventional electronic sensors, with the advantage of being immune to 
      electromagnetic interferences and usable in humid environments. In addition to 
      the pressure, the breathing rate was also monitored. By combining the proposed 
      sensing architecture with a wheelchair user detection software, it is possible to 
      create alerts for the user to know when a new position should be adopted, in 
      order to relieve the pressure in a specific area, thus avoiding one of the 
      biggest problems for such patients, pressure ulcers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine factors associated with 
      early symptomatic acromial and scapular spine fractures in patients who underwent 
      reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 
      all RTSAs performed by the senior author between 1/1/2013 and 6/1/2019. We 
      evaluated patient demographics including gender, age, prevalence of comorbidities 
      including osteoporosis, inflammatory arthritis, diabetes, and endocrine disorders 
      such as hypothyroidism. We also evaluated preoperative and 2-week postoperative 
      radiographs for center of rotation medialization (CORM) as distance between the 
      center of the humeral head or glenosphere and the line of the deltoid, and 
      distalization via the acromial-greater tuberosity distance (AGT). We evaluated 
      inter- and intra-rater reliability via intraclass correlation coefficients. 
      RESULTS: We included 335 RTSAs with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up in the 
      analysis. Reliability was acceptable with all intraclass correlation 
      coefficients> 0.75. Symptomatic acromial and scapular spine stress fractures were 
      significantly more common in those with inflammatory arthritis than those without 
      (18% vs. 5%, P = 0.016). The rate of fracture was highest in patients with 
      rheumatoid arthritis (24% vs. 5.2%, P = 0.003). There was no statistically 
      significant association between symptomatic fractures and preoperative CORM or 
      AGT (P = 0.557, P = 0.528) or postoperative CORM or AGT (P = 0.56, P = 0.102). 
      There also was no statistically significant correlation between symptomatic 
      stress fracture and patient age, gender, BMI, smoking, osteoporosis, gout, 
      medical comorbidity, or previous shoulder surgery. CONCLUSION: In this 
      retrospective analysis of postoperative RTSA, symptomatic acromial and scapular 
      stress fractures were significantly more common in patients with rheumatoid 
      arthritis and thus precautions should be taken in these patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: This paper investigates the relationship between core temperature (T c), 
      skin temperature (T s) and heat flux (HF) during exercise in hot conditions. 
      METHOD: Nine test volunteers, wearing an Army Combat Uniform and body armor, 
      participated in three sessions at 25 °C/50 % relative humidity (RH); 35 °C/70 % 
      RH; and 42 °C/20 % RH. Each session consisted of two 1-h treadmill walks at ~350 
      W and ~540 W intensity. T s and HF from six sites on the forehead, sternum, 
      pectoralis, left rib cage, left scapula, and left thigh, and T c (i.e., core 
      temperature pill used as a suppository) were measured. Multiple linear 
      regressions were conducted to derive algorithms that estimate T c from T s and HF 
      at each site. A simple model was developed to simulate influences of thermal 
      conductivity and thickness of the local body tissues on the relationship between 
      T c, T s, and HF. RESULTS: Coefficient of determination (R (2)) ranged from 0.30 
      to 0.88, varying with locations and conditions. Good sites for T c measurement at 
      surface were the sternum, and a combination of the sternum, scapula, and rib 
      sites. The combination of T s and HF measured at the sternum explained ~75 % or 
      more of variance in observed T c in hot environments. The forehead was found 
      unsuitable for exercise in heat due to sweating and evaporative heat loss. The 
      derived algorithms are likely applicable only for the same ensemble or ensembles 
      with similar thermal and vapor resistances. CONCLUSION: Algorithms for T c 
      measurement are location-specific and their accuracy is dependent, to a large 
      degree, on sensor placement.

TI  - Transdermal fentanyl compared with parenteral buprenorphine in post-surgical pain 
      in swine: a case study.
PG  - 386-98
AB  - The use of pigs as research animals in survival surgery has increased greatly in 
      the last 15 years. Personnel conducting pig research have been hampered by a lack 
      of proven long-acting analgesics for treatment of surgical pain of longer 
      duration, and by a lack of reliable non-subjective parameters for the assessment 
      of pain relief. The efficacy of the mixed opioid agonist-antagonist buprenorphine 
      hydrochloride 0.10 mg/kg pr (n = 2) in the treatment of post-thoracotomy pain was 
      compared with that of a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) delivering 25 
      microg/h (n = 3) or 50 microg/h (n = 2) of the mu opioid agonist fentanyl 
      hydrochloride. Food consumption, pain score, activity level and rate of movement 
      were assessed under four conditions: normal pre-operative control (24h), 
      pre-operative with analgesic alone (24h) and post-operative days 1, 2, 3 (72h). 
      Serum concentration-time curves for fentanyl in clinical cases revealed that 
      female Yorkshire cross pigs weighing 26.2+ 2.1 kg achieved serum values in the 
      recognized human therapeutic range when treated with TTS fentanyl at 50 microg/h 
      and experienced adequate pain control. Pigs treated with 25 microg/h TTS fentanyl 
      had serum levels below the human analgesic range, experienced less adequate 
      analgesia, and required supplemental analgesia in some cases. Based on existing 
      pharmacokinetic data for fentanyl in pigs, the rate of uptake of TTS fentanyl 
      when attached on inter-scapular skin was lower than predicted. Clinical pain 
      scores and time intervals between each major postural change were not affected by 
      analgesics in the absence of pain, but increased in all groups after surgery 
      regardless of treatment. Food consumption was unaffected by analgesic treatment 
      alone but decreased in all groups after surgery regardless of treatment. 
      Analgesic effects on postoperative activity level were variable. TTS fentanyl at 
      appropriate doses is a cost effective means of delivering basal analgesia 
      following major surgery in pigs.

TI  - Shoulder kinematics with two-plane x-ray evaluation in patients with anterior 
      instability or rotator cuff tearing.
PG  - 516-27
AB  - The goals of this study were to define biplanar glenohumeral kinematics and 
      glenohumeral-scapulothoracic motion relationships in normal patients with a 
      two-plane radiograph series and then in patients with anterior shoulder 
      instability or rotator cuff tear both before surgery and after surgical repair 
      and postoperative rehabilitation. A two-plane radiographic series of x-ray films 
      in the scapular and horizontal (axillary) planes was performed. With these films, 
      measurements of the relationship between the centers of the humeral head and 
      glenoid and measurements of the component contributions of glenohumeral and 
      scapulothoracic motion to total arm abduction were made. Six normal adults 
      underwent x-ray evaluation to establish normal control values. Kappa analysis was 
      used to determine reliability of technique. Eighteen patients with confirmed 
      anterior shoulder instability (group A) and 15 with confirmed rotator cuff tears 
      (group B) were studied before surgery. Seven (39%) of 18 of the patients in group 
      A and all 15 (100%) of the patients in group B demonstrated superior translation 
      of the humeral head during scapular plane abduction. In the horizontal plane 14 
      (78%) of 18 patients in group A (instability) and none in group B (rotator cuff 
      tear) demonstrated abnormal anterior translation of the humeral head on the 
      glenoid. Both groups demonstrated altered glenohumeral-scapulothoracic motion 
      relationships compared with the normal control group. Two years after surgery 12 
      patients from group A and 14 patients from group B were restudied. All of these 
      patients had demonstrated abnormalities of humeral head translation before 
      surgery. For group A 12 (100%) of 12 patients demonstrated normal glenohumeral 
      kinematics in both planes after open anterior stabilization. For group B 12 (86%) 
      of 14 patients demonstrated normal glenohumeral kinematics in both planes after 
      open rotator cuff repair. In group A the altered glenohumeral-scapulothoracic 
      motion relationships persisted, whereas in group B these relationships became 
      normal.

TI  - Three-dimensional shoulder kinematics: Upright four-dimensional computed 
      tomography in comparison with an optical three-dimensional motion capture system.
LID - 10.1002/jor.25342 [doi]
AB  - Although shoulder kinematics have been analyzed by various methods, dynamic 
      shoulder motion is difficult to track. This study aimed to validate the shoulder 
      kinematic analysis using upright four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) and 
      to compare the results with optical three-dimensional motion capture. During 
      active elevation, bilateral shoulders of 10 healthy volunteers were tracked using 
      4DCT and motion capture. The scapulothoracic and glenohumeral rotations and the 
      scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) at each position were calculated, and the differences 
      between 4DCT and motion capture were compared. During 10-140° of humerothoracic 
      elevation, the scapulothoracic joint showed upward rotation, internal rotation, 
      and posterior tilting, and the glenohumeral joint showed elevation, external 
      rotation, and anterior plane of elevation in both analyses. In scapulothoracic 
      rotations, the mean differences between the two analyses were -2.6° in upward 
      rotation, 13.9° in internal rotation, and 6.4° in posterior tilting, and became 
      significant with humerothoracic elevation ≥110° in upward rotation, ≥50° in 
      internal rotation, and ≥100° in posterior tilting. In glenohumeral rotations, the 
      mean differences were 3.7° in elevation, 9.1° in internal rotation, and -8.8° in 
      anterior plane of elevation, and became significant with humerothoracic elevation 
      ≥110° in elevation, ≥90° in internal rotation, and ≥100° in anterior plane of 
      elevation. The mean overall SHRs were 1.8 in 4DCT and 2.4 in motion capture, and 
      the differences became significant with humerothoracic elevation ≥100°. The 4DCT 
      analysis of in vivo shoulder kinematics using upright computed tomography scanner 
      is feasible, but the values were different from those by skin-based analysis at 
      the elevated arm positions.

TI  - The effect of intracortical bone pin on shoulder kinematics during dynamic 
      activities.
PG  - 47-53
LID - 10.1080/23335432.2019.1633958 [doi]
AB  - Intracortical bone pins are introduced as gold standard for analysing skeletal 
      motion because of eliminating soft tissue artefact. However, excluding this 
      methodological error might be in cost of intervening movement pattern by local 
      anaesthesia and pain of external tool within body. The purpose of this study was 
      to examine whether intracortical bone pins alter shoulder joint kinematics or 
      coordination. Three subjects were analysed during arm elevation/depression in 
      frontal and sagittal planes. Retroreflective skin markers captured the motion in 
      two sessions, before and after inserting bone pins (SKIN and PIN sessions), 
      respectively. Thoracohumeral and scapulothoracic kinematics and scapulohumeral 
      rhythm (SHR) were compared between two sessions. Thoracohumeral exhibited lower 
      elevation and internal rotation in PIN session especially close to maximum arm 
      elevation. The highest differences were observed for scapulothoracic kinematics, 
      with higher retraction during abduction as well as higher posterior tilt, lateral 
      rotation and retraction during flexion in PIN session. In addition, no systematic 
      changes in SHR between subjects was found. Statistically significant lower SHR in 
      PIN session was observed over 87-100% of thoracohumeral elevation/depression 
      cycle in frontal plane and over 25-61% in sagittal plane. Further studies should 
      treat carefully toward the clinical validity of shoulder joint kinematics after 
      inserting bone pins.

TI  - Glenoid neck length in a healthy population and its association with scapular 
      notching.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scapular notching is a radiographic finding associated with the use 
      of a reverse shoulder prosthesis. The morphological characteristics of the 
      glenoid neck have been scarcely explored as a relevant factor in relation to 
      scapular notching. The objective of this study is to measure the length of the 
      glenoid neck in a three-dimensional CT reconstruction of a healthy population and 
      to simulate the scapular notching free range of motion for the "long neck" and 
      for the "short neck" groups. METHODS: CT scans of 214 shoulders were reviewed, 
      excluding incomplete, poor quality, or altered studies. 100 CT scans were finally 
      processed. The mean age was 51.7 years (SD 19.4; range, 15-84 years), with 49 
      female and 51 male patients. For each of the scapulae, four morphometric 
      measurements were obtained: anterior glenoid neck (AGN), middle glenoid neck 
      (MGN), posterior glenoid neck (PGN) and alternative posterior glenoid neck 
      (aPGN). Using 3D software, we simulated a reverse shoulder prosthesis, and the 
      scapular notching free range of motion was registered. Differences between 
      measurements were evaluated with an unpaired t-test using StataIC16®. P-values < 
      0.05 were considered significant. The intraobserver and interobserver correlation 
      was evaluated with the intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The AGN 
      measured 7.43 ± 2.52 mm (range, 1.72-13.3 mm); MGN measured 8.05 mm ± 1.93 
      (range, 2.92-13.2 mm); PGN measured 7.26 ± 2.6 mm (range, 2-13.4 mm); and aPGN 
      measured 8.97 ± 2.3 mm (range, 4.08-15.4 mm). The scapular notching free range of 
      motion for the "long neck" group was 74.98° ± 7.35 (range, 55-83°) and for the 
      "short neck" group, it was 62.93° ± 6.84 (range, 45-70°) (p = 0.0004). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of posterior glenoid neck length exhibits excellent 
      reliability and reproducibility, as well as being associated to the scapular 
      notching free range of motion. STUDY DESIGN: Basic, retrospective, CT images 
      research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The physical signs of obstetrical brachial plexus palsy range from 
      temporary upper-limb dysfunction to a lifelong impairment and deformity in one 
      arm. The aim of this study was to analyze the kinematics of the upper limb and to 
      evaluate the contribution of glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints of 
      obstetrical brachial plexus palsy children. METHODS: Six children participated in 
      this study: 2 males and 4 females with a mean age of 11.7years. Three patients 
      had a C5, C6 lesion and 3 had a C5, C6, C7 lesion. They were asked to perform 
      five tasks based on the Mallet scale and the kinematic data were collected using 
      the Fastrak electromagnetic tracking device. FINDINGS: The scapulothoracic 
      protraction and posterior tilt were significantly increased in the involved limb 
      during the hand to mouth task (p=0.006 and p=0.015 respectively). The 
      scapulothoracic Protraction/glenohumeral Elevation ratio was significantly 
      increased in the involved limb during the hand to neck task (p=0.041) and the 
      elevation task (p=0.015). The ratios of scapulothoracic Tilt on the three 
      glenohumeral excursion angles were significantly increased during the hand to 
      mouth task (p≤0.041). The scapulothoracic Mediolateral/glenohumeral Elevation 
      ratio was significantly increased in the involved limb during the elevation task 
      (p=0.038). The glenohumeral elevation excursion was significantly decreased in 
      the involved limb during the hand to neck task (p<0.001) and the elevation task 
      (p=0.0003). INTERPRETATION: This study gives us information about the greater 
      contribution of the scapulothoracic joint to shoulder motion for affected arm of 
      obstetrical brachial plexus palsy patients compared to their unaffected arm. 
      Kinematic analysis could be useful in shoulder motion evaluation during the 
      Mallet score and to evaluate outcomes after surgery.

TI  - The phenomenon of disproportionate antecollis in Parkinson's disease and multiple 
      system atrophy.
PG  - 2325-31
AB  - We sought to explore the phenomenon of disproportionate antecollis in multiple 
      system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The etiology is much debated 
      and the main issue is whether it represents a primary myopathy or is secondary to 
      the underlying motor disorder. The clinical, electrophysiological, and biopsy 
      data of MSA or PD patients with antecollis were reviewed. We reviewed 16 patients 
      (7 MSA and 9 PD) who developed antecollis during the course of their disease. The 
      interval between onset of motor symptoms and of antecollis was shorter in the MSA 
      group (4.6 +/- 1.7 years vs. 10.5 +/- 7.0 years). In 6 patients, the antecollis 
      developed subacutely, and in 2 the abnormal neck flexion was initially an 
      off-period phenomenon. Two additional patients also showed some 
      dopa-responsiveness. Clinically, the antecollis was characterized by a forward 
      flexion and anterior shift of the neck, with prominent cervical paraspinal and 
      levator scapulae muscles, usually without weakness of residual neck extension. 
      Electromyography of cervical paraspinal muscles showed mixed myopathic, normal, 
      and neurogenic units, without early recruitment. Cervical paraspinal muscle 
      biopsy in 2 patients disclosed fibrosis and nonspecific myopathic changes. We 
      suggest that, in the context of MSA or PD, the initiating event in antecollis 
      could be a disproportionately increased tone in anterior neck muscles that leads 
      to secondary fibrotic and myopathic changes. However, a primary but yet 
      unexplained neck extensor myopathy still remains the alternative possibility and 
      longitudinal studies are necessary to settle this issue.

TI  - Free scapular osteocutaneous flap for mandibular reconstruction.
PG  - 1334-40
AB  - Seventeen patients, 4 of whom had osteoradionecrosis, underwent mandibular 
      reconstruction with a revascularized scapular osteocutaneous flap. The mean 
      length of revascularized scapular bone used was 10.4 cm. Nine of the 17 flaps 
      healed uneventfully; however, previously irradiated patients had a higher 
      incidence of postoperative complications. There was only 1 flap failure. We found 
      the free revascularized scapular osteocutaneous flap to be reliable and ideal for 
      the reconstruction of large composite defects of the oral cavity.

TI  - Determination of a reference system for the three-dimensional study of the 
      glenohumeral relationship.
PG  - 1061-71
LID - 10.1007/s00256-013-1572-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Knowledge of the normal and pathological three-dimensional 
      glenohumeral relationship is imperative when planning and performing a total 
      shoulder arthroplasty. There is, however, no consensus on which references should 
      be used when studying this relationship. The purpose of the present study was to 
      define the most suitable glenoid plane with normally distributed parameters, 
      narrowest variability, and best reproducibility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Three-dimensional reconstruction CT scans were performed on 152 healthy 
      shoulders. Four glenoid planes, each determined by three surgically accessible 
      bony reference points, were determined. Two planes were triangular, with the same 
      base defined by the most anterior and posterior point of the glenoid. The most 
      inferior and the most superior point of the glenoid, respectively, define the top 
      of Saller's inferior plane and the Saller's superior plane. The two other planes 
      are formed by best-fitting circles. The circular max plane is defined by the 
      superior tubercle, and two points at the distal third of the glenoid. The 
      circular inferior plane is defined by three points at the rim of the inferior 
      quadrants of the glenoid. RESULTS: The parameters of all four planes behave 
      normally. The humeral center of rotation is identically positioned for both the 
      circular max and circular inferior plane (X = 91.71°/X = 91.66° p = 0.907 and 
      Y = 90.83°/Y = 91.7° p = 0.054, respectively) and different for the Saller's 
      inferior and Saller's superior plane (p ≤ 0.001). The circular inferior plane has 
      the lowest variability to the coronal scapular plane (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study provides arguments to use the circular inferior glenoid plane as 
      preferred reference plane of the glenoid.

      Thirty-three male subjects (18 to 34 years) participated in this study. Group one 
      (n=15) had shoulder pathology; Group two (n=18) did not have pathology. A 
      test-retest, repeated measures design, with three experienced raters and the 
      three positions of the LSST, was used to test the reliability of the LSST. All 
      measurements in each position were taken bilaterally. RESULTS: Pearson 
      Correlations for Position 1 and 2 ranged from .78 to .92 whereas position 3 
      ranged from .62 to .81. The ICC (2,2) ranged from .87 to .95 for positions 1 and 
      2. ICC (2,2) ranged from .70 to.82 for positions 3. Overall ICC (2,3) ranged from 
      .83 to .96. The coefficients of determination ranged from .38 to .89. The SEM 
      ranged from 3.00 to 8.26 mm, with the largest error found in position 3. 
      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The LSST can be reliable in screening scapular 
      position. Although a large range of error exists in measurements as indicated by 
      the standard error of the measurement, the LSST provides more objective measures 
      than pure observation.

AB  - The objectives of this study were: 1) to identify the ultrasonographic (US) 
      abnormalities and 2) to compare the findings of physical examination with US 
      findings in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with shoulder pain. We studied 30 
      RA patients. Physical examination was performed systemically as follows: 1) area 
      of tenderness; 2) range of passive and active shoulder motion; 3) impingement 
      tests; 4) maneuvers for determining the location of the tendon lesions. US 
      investigations included the biceps, the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and 
      subscapularis tendons; the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa; and the glenohumeral and 
      acromioclavicular joints. Thirty RA patients with 35 painful and 25 non-painful 
      shoulders were examined. The range of motion affected the most by shoulder pain 
      was abduction. The most frequent US finding of shoulder joint was effusion in the 
      long head of the biceps tendon. Among the rotator cuff tendons, subscapularis was 
      the most frequently involved. Tendon tear was also common among non-painful 
      shoulders. Physical examination used for the diagnosis of shoulder pain had low 
      sensitivity and specificity for detecting abnormalities in the rheumatoid 
      shoulder joint. In conclusion, US abnormalities showed frequent tendon tears in 
      our RA patients. Physical examination had low sensitivity and specificity for 
      detecting rotator cuff tear in the rheumatoid shoulder joint.

AB  - We developed a transwell assay to quantify migration of the Lyme disease agent, 
      Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), toward Ixodes scapularis salivary 
      gland proteins. The assay was designed to assess B. burgdorferi s.s. migration 
      upward against gravity through a transwell polycarbonate membrane overlaid with 
      6% gelatin. Borreliae that channeled into the upper transwell chamber in response 
      to test proteins were enumerated by flow cytometry. The transwell assay measured 
      chemoattractant activity for B. burgdorferi s.s. from salivary gland extract 
      (SGE) harvested from nymphal ticks during bloodmeal engorgement on mice 42 h 
      post-attachment and saliva collected from adult ticks. Additionally, SGE protein 
      fractions separated by size exclusion chromatography demonstrated various levels 
      of chemoattractant activity in the transwell assay. Sialostatin L, and Salp-like 
      proteins 9 and 11 were identified by mass spectrometry in SGE fractions that 
      exhibited elevated activity. Recombinant forms of these proteins were tested in 
      the transwell assay and showed positive chemoattractant properties compared to 
      controls and another tick protein, S15A. These results were reproducible 
      providing evidence that the transwell assay is a useful method for continuing 
      investigations to find tick saliva components instrumental in driving B. 
      burgdorferi s.s. chemotaxis.

TI  - Functional multijoint position reproduction acuity in overhead-throwing athletes.
PG  - 146-53
AB  - CONTEXT: Baseball players rely on the sensorimotor system to uphold the balance 
      between upper extremity stability and mobility while maintaining athletic 
      performance. However, few researchers have studied functional multijoint measures 
      of sensorimotor acuity in overhead-throwing athletes. OBJECTIVE: To compare 
      sensorimotor acuity between 2 high-demand functional positions and among planes 
      of motion within individual joints and to describe a novel method of measuring 
      sensorimotor function. DESIGN: Single-session, repeated-measures design. SETTING: 
      University musculoskeletal research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: 
      Twenty-one National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I baseball players 
      (age = 20.8 +/- 1.5 years, height = 181.3 +/- 5.1 cm, mass = 87.8 +/- 9.1 kg) 
      with no history of upper extremity injury or central nervous system disorder. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We measured active multijoint position reproduction 
      acuity in multiple planes using an electromagnetic tracking device. Subjects 
      reproduced 2 positions: arm cock and ball release. We calculated absolute and 
      variable error for individual motions at the scapulothoracic, glenohumeral, 
      elbow, and wrist joints and calculated overall joint acuity with 3-dimensional 
      variable error. RESULTS: Acuity was significantly better in the arm-cock position 
      compared with ball release at the scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joints. We 
      observed significant differences among planes of motion within the 
      scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joints at ball release. Scapulothoracic internal 
      rotation and glenohumeral horizontal abduction and rotation displayed less acuity 
      than other motions. CONCLUSIONS: We established the reliability of a functional 
      measure of upper extremity sensorimotor system acuity in baseball players. Using 
      this technique, we observed differences in acuity between 2 test positions and 
      among planes of motion within the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints. 
      Clinicians may consider these differences when designing and implementing 
      sensorimotor system training. Our error scores are similar in magnitude to those 
      reported using single-joint and single-plane measures. However, 3-dimensional, 
      multijoint measures allow practical, unconstrained test positions and offer 
      additional insight into the upper extremity as a functional unit.

AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) may result in tetraplegia (motor and/or 
      sensory nervous system impairment of the arms, trunk and legs) or paraplegia 
      (motor and/or sensory impairment of the trunk and/or legs only). The adverse 
      effects of SCI on health, fitness and functioning are frequently compounded by 
      profoundly sedentary behaviour. People with paraplegia (PP) and tetraplegia (TP) 
      have reduced exercise capacity due to paralysis/paresis and reduced exercising 
      stroke volume. TP often further reduces exercise capacity due to lower maximum 
      heart-rate and respiratory function. There is strong, consistent evidence that 
      exercise can improve cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength in people 
      with SCI. There is emerging evidence for a range of other exercise benefits, 
      including reduced risk of cardio-metabolic disease, depression and shoulder pain, 
      as well as improved respiratory function, quality-of-life and functional 
      independence. Exercise recommendations for people with SCI are: ≥30min of 
      moderate aerobic exercise on ≥5d/week or ≥20min of vigorous aerobic ≥3d/week; 
      strength training on ≥2d/week, including scapula stabilisers and posterior 
      shoulder girdle; and ≥2d/week flexibility training, including shoulder internal 
      and external rotators. These recommendations may be aspirational for profoundly 
      inactive clients and stratification into "beginning", "intermediate" and 
      "advanced" will assist application of the recommendations in clinical practice. 
      Flexibility exercise is recommended to preserve upper limb function but may not 
      prevent contracture. For people with TP, Rating of Perceived Exertion may provide 
      a more valid indication of exercise intensity than heart rate. The safety and 
      effectiveness of exercise interventions can be enhanced by initial screening for 
      autonomic dysreflexia, orthostatic hypotension, exercise-induced hypotension, 
      thermoregulatory dysfunction, pressure sores, spasticity and pain.

AB  - Fluoroscopy and 2D/3D shape-matching has emerged as the standard for 
      non-invasively quantifying kinematics. However, its accuracy has not been well 
      established for the shoulder complex when using single-plane fluoroscopy. The 
      purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of single-plane fluoroscopy 
      and 2D/3D shape-matching for quantifying full shoulder complex kinematics. 
      Tantalum markers were implanted into the clavicle, humerus, and scapula of four 
      cadaveric shoulders. Biplane radiographs were obtained with the shoulder in five 
      humerothoracic elevation positions (arm at the side, 30°, 60°, 90°, maximum). 
      Images from both systems were used to perform marker tracking, while only those 
      images acquired with the primary fluoroscopy system were used to perform 2D/3D 
      shape-matching. Kinematics errors due to shape-matching were calculated as the 
      difference between marker tracking and 2D/3D shape-matching and expressed as root 
      mean square (RMS) error, bias, and precision. Overall RMS errors for the 
      glenohumeral joint ranged from 0.7 to 3.3° and 1.2 to 4.2 mm, while errors for 
      the acromioclavicular joint ranged from 1.7 to 3.4°. Errors associated with 
      shape-matching individual bones ranged from 1.2 to 3.2° for the humerus, 0.5 to 
      1.6° for the scapula, and 0.4 to 3.7° for the clavicle. The results of the study 
      demonstrate that single-plane fluoroscopy and 2D/3D shape-matching can accurately 
      quantify full shoulder complex kinematics in static positions.

AB  - Fluoroscopic imaging, using single plane or dual plane images, has grown in 
      popularity to measure dynamic in vivo human shoulder joint kinematics. However, 
      no study has quantified the difference in spatial positional accuracy between 
      single and dual plane image-model registration applied to the shoulder joint. In 
      this paper, an automatic 2D-3D image-model registration technique was validated 
      for accuracy and repeatability with single and dual plane fluoroscopic images. 
      Accuracy was assessed in a cadaver model, kinematics found using the automatic 
      registration technique were compared to those found using radiostereometric 
      analysis. The in vivo repeatability of the automatic registration technique was 
      assessed during the dynamic abduction motion of four human subjects. The in vitro 
      data indicated that the error in spatial positional accuracy of the humerus and 
      the scapula was less than 0.30mm in translation and less than 0.58° in rotation 
      using dual plane images. Single plane accuracy was satisfactory for in-plane 
      motion variables, but out-of-plane motion variables on average were approximately 
      8 times less accurate. The in vivo test indicated that the repeatability of the 
      automatic 2D-3D image-model registration was 0.50mm in translation and 1.04° in 
      rotation using dual images. For a single plane technique, the repeatability was 
      3.31mm in translation and 2.46° in rotation for measuring shoulder joint 
      kinematics. The data demonstrate that accurate and repeatable shoulder joint 
      kinematics can be obtained using dual plane fluoroscopic images with an automatic 
      2D-3D image-model registration technique; and that out-of-plane motion variables 
      are less accurate than in-plane motion variables using a single plane technique.

TI  - Clinical Assessment of Scapula Motion: Scapula Upward Rotation and Relationship 
      with Injury in Swimmers.
LID - 10.3390/sports4010008 [doi]
LID - 8
AB  - Abnormal scapulothoracic mechanics and scapulohumeral rhythm are implicated in 
      shoulder pathologies, including glenohumeral impingement and rotator cuff tears. 
      Upward scapula rotation, specifically asymmetry of scapula motion and 
      associations of patterns through range with injury, was investigated in dominant 
      and non-dominant limbs of nationally ranked junior and Paralympic swimmers during 
      competition season. The static and throughout phases measures of upward scapula 
      rotation were: Phase I (start position, 45°), Phase II (45° to 90°), Phase III 
      (90° to 135°) and Phase IV (135° to max). Injury was assessed with a validated 
      questionnaire. Differences between side (dominant and non-dominant), group 
      (junior and Paralympic), and phase were examined. Significant differences (P < 
      0.05) between groups were identified for dominant side at rest, 45° and 135°, and 
      in phases II and IV (including range). Scapulohumeral rhythm was higher in the 
      non-dominant limb of Paralympic swimmers but in the dominant limb of junior 
      swimmers. Greatest differences in upward rotation between injured and non-injured 
      swimmers were found in Phase 1: 43.6% (3.3°) Paralympic; 73.1% (8°) junior. 
      Results suggest asymmetry of movement in both limbs, through all phases, and at 
      single points in range, should be investigated for assessing injury and 
      developing preventive strategies and rehabilitation protocols.

TI  - Normalized Isometric Shoulder Strength as a Predictor of Ball Velocity in Youth 
      Baseball Players.
PG  - 259-269
LID - 10.26603/001c.31045 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite increased awareness of factors related to athletic 
      performance and injury prevention, youth and adolescent baseball players continue 
      to report injuries at alarming rates. Upper extremity muscle strength is an 
      integral part of physical assessment and injury prevention in baseball players, 
      however minimal data exists in youth populations. Changes in anthropometric 
      measures, inherent in physically developing athletes, have been shown to impact 
      strength measures, however normalization methodology is rarely reported. PURPOSE: 
      The purposes of this study were to 1) compare the measurement properties of five 
      potential methods for normalizing isometric shoulder strength in a cohort of 9-12 
      year old male baseball players and 2) examine the relationship between normalized 
      isometric shoulder strength and ball velocity in a cohort of 9-12 year old male 
      baseball players. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study (n=159). METHODS: 
      Baseline and follow up height, weight and bilateral ulnar length measurements 
      were assessed followed by isometric strength in both the dominant and 
      non-dominant shoulders. Strength measures included scapular plane abduction 
      (scaption), external rotation (ER) at 0°, ER and internal rotation (IR) at 90°. 
      Ball velocity was assessed as a measure of throwing performance. Intraclass 
      correlation coefficients (ICC2,1), standard errors of measurement (SEM) and 
      minimal detectable change (MDC95) were calculated for all strength measures. 
      Repeated measures ANOVA were conducted comparing changes in normalized strength 
      using five separate anthropometric measures: weight, height, body mass index, 
      ulnar length and % of non-dominant shoulder strength. Linear regression models 
      were used to examine the relationships between normalized isometric shoulder 
      strength and ball velocity. Statistical significance was set a priori at α=0.05. 
      RESULTS: Shoulder strength normalized using ulnar length was the only method that 
      demonstrated excellent reliability (ICC2,1 0.98-0.99) and detected significant 
      changes between strength in each of the four measures tested (SEM 0.39-0.69 Nm). 
      Modest but significant correlations were observed between scaption and ball 
      velocity (r2 = 0.27, p < 0.001) and ER at 0° and ball velocity (r2 = 0.23, p < 
      0.001). CONCLUSION: Ulnar length was the most stable and reliable normalization 
      method for assessing isometric shoulder strength in youth baseball players. In 
      addition, normalized scaption strength was the most significant predictor of ball 
      velocity, followed by ER at 0° strength in this population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:

AB  - BACKGROUND: Upper limb coordination in persons post-stroke may be estimated by 
      the commonly used Finger-to-Nose Test (FNT), which is also part of the Fugl-Meyer 
      Assessment. The total movement time (TMT) is used as a clinical outcome measure, 
      while kinematic evaluation also enables an objective quantification of movement 
      quality and motor performance. Our aims were to kinematically characterize FNT 
      performance in persons post-stroke and controls and to investigate the construct 
      validity of the test in persons with varying levels of impairment post-stroke. 
      METHODS: A three-dimensional motion capture system recorded body movements during 
      performance of the FNT in 33 persons post-stroke who had mild or moderate upper 
      limb motor impairments (Fugl-Meyer scores of 50-62 or 32-49, respectively), and 
      41 non-disabled controls. TMT and kinematic variables of the hand (pointing time, 
      peak speed, time to peak speed, number of movement units, path ratio, and 
      pointing accuracy), elbow/shoulder joints (range of motion, interjoint 
      coordination), and scapular/trunk movement were calculated. Our analysis focused 
      on the pointing phase (knee to nose movement of the FNT). Independent t or 
      Mann-Whitney U tests and effect sizes were used to analyze group differences. 
      Sub-group analyses based on movement time and stroke severity were performed. 
      Within the stroke group, simple and multiple linear regression were used to 
      identify relationships between TMT to kinematic variables. RESULTS: The stroke 
      group had significant slower TMT (mean difference 2.6 s, d = 1.33) than the 
      control group, and six other kinematic variables showed significant group 
      differences. At matched speeds, the stroke group had lower accuracy and excessive 
      scapular and trunk movements compared to controls. Pointing time and elbow 
      flexion during the pointing phase were most related to stroke severity. For the 
      stroke group, the number of movement units during the pointing phase showed the 
      strongest association with the TMT, and explained 60% of the TMT variance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The timed FNT discriminates between persons with mild and moderate 
      upper limb impairments. However, kinematic analysis to address construct validity 
      highlights differences in pointing movement post-stroke that are not captured in 
      the timed FNT.

PG  - 942-7
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2009.02.012 [doi]
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: The impingement mechanisms of the Neer and Hawkins sign remain 
      unclear. In addition, there is still a lack of agreement regarding the arm 
      rotation when performing the Neer sign. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight fresh frozen 
      cadaveric shoulders were investigated. The specimens were attached to a 
      shoulder-positioning device to which a compression force was applied. Subacromial 
      contact pressure was measured with a flexible force sensor. The Neer sign was 
      performed in three arm rotations (neutral, internal, and external). RESULTS: The 
      contact sites of the coracoacromial arch side were common in both signs; however, 
      those of the humeral head side were anatomically different: the supraspinatus 
      tendon in the Neer sign and the subscapularis tendon in the Hawkins sign. The 
      mean contact pressure in the Neer sign performed with the arm in internal 
      rotation was greater than that in the Neer sign with the arm in other rotations. 
      DISCUSSION: The data from this study indicate that the Neer and Hawkins signs do 
      not represent the same impingement mechanism. The contact sites on the humeral 
      head side were anatomically different. Additionally, it was found that the 
      maximum contact pressure for the Neer sign is with internal rotation of the arm.

TI  - Automated quality assessment of chest radiographs based on deep learning and 
      linear regression cascade algorithms.
LID - 10.1007/s00330-022-08771-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Develop and evaluate the performance of deep learning and linear 
      regression cascade algorithms for automated assessment of the image layout and 
      position of chest radiographs. METHODS: This retrospective study used 10 
      quantitative indices to capture subjective perceptions of radiologists regarding 
      image layout and position of chest radiographs, including the chest edges, field 
      of view (FOV), clavicles, rotation, scapulae, and symmetry. An automated 
      assessment system was developed using a training dataset consisting of 1025 adult 
      posterior-anterior chest radiographs. The evaluation steps included: (i) use of a 
      CNN framework based on ResNet - 34 to obtain measurement parameters for 
      quantitative indices and (ii) analysis of quantitative indices using a multiple 
      linear regression model to obtain predicted scores for the layout and position of 
      chest radiograph. In the testing dataset (n = 100), the performance of the 
      automated system was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient 
      (ICC), Pearson correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute difference (MAD), and 
      mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). RESULTS: The stepwise regression showed a 
      statistically significant relationship between the 10 quantitative indices and 
      subjective scores (p < 0.05). The deep learning model showed high accuracy in 
      predicting the quantitative indices (ICC = 0.82 to 0.99, r = 0.69 to 0.99, MAD = 
      0.01 to 2.75). The automatic system provided assessments similar to the mean 
      opinion scores of radiologists regarding image layout (MAPE = 3.05%) and position 
      (MAPE = 5.72%). CONCLUSIONS: Ten quantitative indices correlated well with the 
      subjective perceptions of radiologists regarding the image layout and position of 
      chest radiographs. The automated system provided high performance in measuring 
      quantitative indices and assessing image quality. KEY POINTS: • Objective and 
      reliable assessment for image quality of chest radiographs is important for 
      improving image quality and diagnostic accuracy. • Deep learning can be used for 
      automated measurements of quantitative indices from chest radiographs. • Linear 
      regression can be used for interpretation-based quality assessment of chest 
      radiographs.

TI  - The influence of external loads on movement precision during active shoulder 
      internal rotation movements as measured by 3 indices of accuracy.
PG  - 60-6
AB  - CONTEXT: Using constant, variable, and absolute error to measure movement 
      accuracy might provide a more complete description of joint position sense than 
      any of these values alone. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of loaded movements 
      and type of feedback on shoulder joint position sense and movement velocity. 
      DESIGN: Applied study with repeated measures comparing type of feedback and the 
      presence of a load. SETTING: Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Twenty 
      healthy subjects (age = 27.2 +/- 3.3 years, height = 173.2 +/- 18.1 cm, mass = 
      70.8 +/- 14.5 kg) were seated with their arms in a custom shoulder wheel. 
      INTERVENTION(S): Subjects internally rotated 27 degrees in the plane of the 
      scapula, with either visual feedback provided by a video monitor or 
      proprioceptive feedback provided by prior passive positioning, to a target at 48 
      degrees of external rotation. Subjects performed the internal rotation movements 
      with video feedback and proprioceptive feedback and with and without load (5% of 
      body weight). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): High-speed motion analysis recorded peak 
      rotational velocity and accuracy. Constant, variable, and absolute error for 
      joint position sense was calculated from the final position. RESULTS: Unloaded 
      movements demonstrated significantly greater variable error than for loaded 
      movements (2.0 +/- 0.7 degrees and 1.5 +/- 0.4 degrees, respectively) (P < .05), 
      but there were no differences in constant or absolute error. Peak velocity was 
      greater for movements with proprioceptive feedback (45.6 +/- 2.9 degrees/s) than 
      visual feedback (39.1 +/- 2.1 degrees/s) and for unloaded (47.8 +/- 3.6 
      degrees/s) than loaded (36.9 +/- 1.0 degrees/s) movements (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Shoulder joint position sense demonstrated greater variable error unloaded versus 
      loaded movements. Both visual feedback and additional loads decreased peak 
      rotational velocity.

TI  - The glenoid-intramedullary humeral angle: a measurement of compensatory scapular 
      abduction in advanced rotator cuff arthropathy and its potential effects on 
      implant choice.
PG  - 707-713
LID - 10.1016/j.jseint.2021.02.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study establishes measurements to evaluate pathologic 
      compensation in rotator cuff tear arthropathy and resultant considerations for 
      reverse shoulder arthroplasty. METHODS: Radiographs of patients with intact 
      rotator cuffs were measured establishing interobserver and intraobserver 
      reliability. Reverse shoulder arthroplasty cases performed by a single surgeon 
      were then retrospectively reviewed. One year of follow-up radiographs were 
      required for inclusion. Preoperative radiographs were analyzed for relative 
      humeral head elevation ratio and humeral abduction relative to the glenoid face, 
      termed the glenoid-intramedullary humeral angle. Statistical analyses assessed 
      associations for radiographic measurements with presence and severity of scapular 
      notching based on the Nerot-Sirveaux classification system. RESULTS: A total of 
      221 patients met inclusion criteria. At the 1-year follow-up, 61 (27.6%) 
      shoulders had radiographic notching. There was a moderately strong (r = -0.56) 
      negative correlation between glenoid-intramedullary humeral angle and humeral 
      head elevation ratio. Patients with humeral head elevation ratio ≥ 20% were 
      significantly (P = .024) and 9.2 times more likely to have notching of any grade. 
      Patients with glenoid-intramedullary humeral angle ≤ 5 degrees were significant 
      (P < .0001) and 6.7 times more likely to have notching of any grade and 
      significantly (P = .00018) and 145 times more likely to have high-grade (3 and 4) 
      notching. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative humeral head elevation and compensatory 
      scapular rotation with relative adduction of the humerus have significant 
      associations with high-grade notching. These radiographic findings have potential 
      to help surgeons in preoperative decision-making regarding implant choice and 
      patient education.

TI  - Shoulder Motion Analysis During Codman Pendulum Exercises.
PG  - e333-e339
LID - 10.1016/j.asmr.2020.04.013 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To quantify shoulder motion during Codman pendulum exercises. METHODS: 
      Shoulder kinematics were analyzed in 17 healthy volunteers using a validated 
      biomechanical model coupling patient-specific imaging and motion capture. 
      Participants were instructed to perform medio-lateral, antero-posterior and 
      circular pendulum exercises. Glenohumeral (GH), scapulothoracic (ST), 
      thoracohumeral (TH) ROM and overall exercise amplitude were calculated for each 
      sequence. Linear regression analyses were carried out to determine association 
      between different components of shoulder motion. RESULTS: Mean overall exercise 
      amplitude was 40.59±11.24° (range, 25.38 to 70.25°) for medio-lateral exercises, 
      46.5±22.02° (range, 20.68 to 100.24°) for antero-posterior exercises, and 
      20.28±7.13° (range, 10.9 to 35.49°) for circular exercises. Mean GH and ST 
      involvement remained minimal, ranging from 6.74 to 13.81°, and 1.5° to 5.12°, 
      respectively. There was no significant correlation between overall exercise 
      amplitude and GH (R = 0.31, p = 0.01) or ST ROM (adjusted R2 = 0.57, p < 0.001), 
      but a moderate correlation with TH ROM (R = 0.73, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This 
      study demonstrates that Codman pendulum exercises depend mainly on truncal 
      movement and produce very little movement in the GH and ST joints. Although they 
      may be a safe way to promote early general stretching of the upper limb, they may 
      be of limited further use in restoring passive shoulder ROM. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 
      This study quantifies motion during frequently administered shoulder 
      rehabilitation exercises and shows that they do not produce significant movement 
      in the shoulder. Their use in restoring passive range of motion is thus 
      questionable.

TI  - Tendon regeneration and muscle hypotrophy after isolated Gracilis tendon 
      harvesting - a pilot study.
PG  - 19
LID - 10.1186/s40634-020-00236-8 [doi]
LID - 19
AB  - PURPOSE: The gracilis tendon (GT) is a commonly used autologous graft in 
      Orthopaedic surgery. The majority of information on knee function and outcomes 
      after hamstring harvest is related to both semitendinosus and GT harvest. Little 
      is known regarding isolated harvest of a GT. It was hypothesized that isolated GT 
      harvest would lead to altered gait patterns (e.g. augmented anterior-posterior 
      translation or rotation in the tibiofemoral joint) and consequently a higher 
      prevalence of cartilage lesions and meniscal tears in knees. METHODS: GT 
      harvesting was performed on patients with chronic acromioclavicular joint 
      instability without previous knee injuries or surgeries. MRI of both knees and 
      thighs were performed. Knee MRI were evaluated using the Whole-Organ Magnetic 
      Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS). Inter- and intraobserver reliabilities, 
      cross-sectional areas of different muscles, fatty infiltration of the gracilis 
      muscle (GM) and GT regeneration were evaluated. The contralateral limb served as 
      reference. The observers were blinded towards the identity of the patients and 
      the operatively treated side. RESULTS: After a mean time of 44 months after 
      surgery testing was performed on 12 patients. No significant side-to-side 
      differences were found using WORMS, although there was a trend towards increased 
      cartilage lesions after GT harvest (median healthy knee 4.8 and GT harvested knee 
      7.8 p = 0.086). Inter- and intraobserver repeatability was high with 0.899 (95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.708-0.960) and 0.988 (95% CI 0.973-0.995), 
      respectively. A significant hypotrophy of the GM with a mean decrease of 25.3%, 
      18.4% and 16.9% occurred at 25% (p = 0.016), 50% (p = 0.007) and 75% (p = 0.002) 
      of the length of the femur from distal. No compensatory hypertrophy of other 
      thigh muscles or increased fatty infiltration of the GM was found. Tendon 
      regeneration took place in eight out of 12 patients. In case of regeneration, the 
      regenerated tendon inserted in a more proximal place. CONCLUSION: Isolated 
      harvest of the GT for shoulder procedures did not affect knee MRI significantly 
      indicating therefore in general suitable graft utilization for surgeries outside 
      of the knee. GT regenerated in most patients with just a more proximal insertion 
      and a hypotrophy of the muscle belly.

TI  - Transcriptional profiling of the murine cutaneous response during initial and 
      subsequent infestations with Ixodes scapularis nymphs.
PG  - 26
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-26 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ixodes scapularis ticks are hematophagous arthropods capable of 
      transmitting many infectious agents to humans. The process of blood feeding is an 
      extended and continuous interplay between tick and host responses. While this 
      process has been studied extensively in vitro, no global understanding of the 
      host response to ticks has emerged. METHODS: To address this issue, we used 
      PCR-arrays to measure skin-specific expression of 233 discrete genes at 8 time 
      points during primary and secondary infestations of mice with pathogen-free I. 
      scapularis nymphs. Selected results were then validated at the mRNA and protein 
      levels by additional real-time PCR and bioplex assay. RESULTS: Primary 
      infestation was characterized by the late induction of an innate immune response. 
      Lectin pattern recognition receptors, cytokines, and chemokines were upregulated 
      consistent with increased neutrophil and macrophage migration. Gene ontology and 
      pathway analyses of downregulated genes suggested inhibition of gene 
      transcription and Th17 immunity. During the secondary infestation, additional 
      genes were modulated suggesting a broader involvement of immune cells including 
      CD8 and CD4 positive T lymphocytes. The cytokine response showed a mixed Th1/Th2 
      profile with a potential for T regulatory cell activity. Key gene ontology 
      clusters observed during the secondary infestation were cell migration and 
      activation. Matrix metalloproteinases were upregulated, apoptosis-related genes 
      were differentially modulated, and immunoreceptor signaling molecules were 
      upregulated. In contrast, transcripts related to mitogenic, WNT, Hedgehog, and 
      stress pathways were downregulated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a model of 
      tick feeding where lectin pattern recognition receptors orchestrate an innate 
      inflammatory response during primary infestation that primes a mixed Th1/Th2 
      response upon secondary exposure. Tick feeding inhibits gene transcription and 
      Th17 immunity. Salivary molecules may also inhibit upregulation of mitogenic, 
      WNT, Hedgehog, and stress pathways and enhance the activity of T regulatory 
      cells, production of IL-10, and suppressors of cytokine signaling molecules 
      (SOCS). This study provides the first comprehensive transcriptional analysis of 
      the murine host response at the I. scapularis bite site and suggests both a 
      potential model of the host cutaneous response and candidate genes for further 
      description and investigation.

TI  - A Comparison of Resting Scapular Posture and the Davies Closed Kinetic Chain 
      Upper Extremity Stability Test.
PG  - 835-843
LID - 10.26603/001c.23425 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In orthopaedic practice, it is well established that weak scapular 
      stabilizers and an unstable scapula is related to shoulder dysfunction. Faulty 
      scapular position has been linked to decreased scapular stability and is thought 
      to be a result of weak or unbalanced timing in the recruitment of scapulothoracic 
      dynamic stabilizing muscles. Kibler has described a four-type classification of 
      scapulothoracic dysfunction. Functional performance testing is used to 
      objectively measure activities that simulate various desired activities. The 
      reliability of assessing the four static scapular positions may be important in 
      diagnosing shoulder dysfunction. An understanding of the scapular position and 
      its relationship to functional performance testing is needed. PURPOSE: The 
      purpose of this study was to determine if a static scapular test, the Kibler 
      scapula classification, in healthy participants affects the ability to perform a 
      closed chain functional test that involves the use of the scapula and the upper 
      extremity, the Davies Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test 
      (CKCUEST). A secondary analysis was performed to evaluate the reliability of a 
      student physical therapist and an experienced physical therapist to identify 
      scapular type by observation. STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter, single session 
      descriptive cohort. METHODS: Sixty-one healthy participants (33 males, 28 
      females; mean age 24.19±2.61) completed testing across two locations in one 
      testing session. Blood pressure and heart rate as well as height and weight were 
      measured for each participant. Participants were classified by visual observation 
      of Kibler scapular classification. The average number of CKUEST touches, a 
      normalized score, and a power score were calculated for each participant. Three 
      trials were performed and participants were required to take a 45-second rest 
      break between each CKCUEST trial. RESULTS: One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
      showed statistically significant differences in Type I and Type IV Kibler scapula 
      classification for the CKCUEST power score, however when an ANCOVA controlled for 
      body mass index, there was no statistically significant difference. A strong 
      correlation r=.94 was observed between student and experienced physical therapist 
      in evaluating all four types of Kibler scapular classification. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Visually observed Kibler scapular position does not affect the ability to perform 
      the Davies CKCUEST in healthy young adults. The ability to identify Kibler 
      scapular position was reliable between student and experienced physical 
      therapists. Additional studies are required to identify the usefulness of the 
      Kibler scapular position classification. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2b: Individual Cohort 
      Study.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of head and shoulder posture.
PG  - 322-9
AB  - Posture of the head, neck, and shoulders has long been recognized as a factor 
      contributing to the onset and perpetuation of cervical pain dysfunction 
      syndromes. Treatment regimens frequently include exercises and instruction for 
      postural correction. Clinical assessment of posture, however, tends to be 
      subjective in nature. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability 
      of a new objective technique of posture measurement and to establish normal 
      standards for the technique. This study used a computer-assisted slide digitizing 
      system called Postural Analysis Digitizing System (PADS) to determine 
      characteristic values for head and shoulder girdle posture and characteristic 
      range of motion for head protraction-retraction and shoulder 
      protraction-retraction in a sample of able-bodied young men. PADS is a 
      modification of a two-dimensional slide digitizing system developed for measuring 
      trunk range of motion. Twenty male subjects were photographed in a neutral 
      position, the maximally protracted position, and the maximally retracted position 
      of the head and scapula. Ten subjects were evaluated once, and ten were evaluated 
      twice. The slide photographs were analyzed using a computer-assisted digitizing 
      system. Well-defined anatomic landmarks were used to determine angular 
      relationships in the head, neck, and shoulders. The reliability of the system was 
      tested by calculating an intraclass correlation coefficient, student t-test, and 
      the percent error for each position. The positions were considered reproducible, 
      and reliability of the system was considered adequate for postural analysis. Mean 
      values for the positions were 28.48 degrees, 51.97 degrees, and 62.09 degrees for 
      head protraction, the neutral position, and head retraction, 
      respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Brosnan, RJ, Watson, G, Stuart, W, Twentyman, C, Kitic, CM, and Schmidt, M. The 
      validity, reliability, and agreement of GPS units-Can we compare research and 
      applied data?. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2021-This study's aim was to 
      investigate the validity, within-brand interunit reliability, and between-brand 
      agreement of movement indicators from 3 commonly used global positioning system 
      (GPS) units used in applied and research settings. Forty-two units (GPSports EVO; 
      10 Hz, n = 13: GPSports HPU; 5 Hz, n = 14: and Catapult S5; 10 Hz, n = 15) were 
      investigated across 3 experiments: a 40-m linear track with all units pushed on a 
      trolley, a sport simulation circuit with all units pulled on a sled, and a 
      similar circuit with 3 models of units placed in a modified GPS vest worn by an 
      athlete between the scapulae. Distance, speed, and acceleration indices were 
      obtained and analyzed with the level of significance set (ρ < 0.05). The results 
      demonstrated good to moderate (% mean difference; 0-6.5%) validity with criterion 
      and good (coefficient of variation [CV] ± 90% confidence interval [CI]: 0-3.9%) 
      interunit reliability for distance and speed in units. Ten hertz units 
      demonstrated good to moderate (CV ± 90% CI: 0.21-5.58%) interunit reliability in 
      all acceleration and deceleration measures, with 5 Hz units having good to poor 
      (CV ± 90% CI: 4.54-12.78%) results. Agreement ranged from good to moderate (% 
      mean difference; 0.01-7.8%) for distance, speed, and absolute 
      acceleration/deceleration. Agreement ranged from good to poor (% mean difference; 
      2.21-32.74%) in average acceleration. The GPS units investigated can be compared 
      within and between applied and research settings for distance and speed. However, 
      caution is warranted in acceleration indices. This highlights the importance of 
      testing other commonly used GPS models and brands.

TI  - Glenohumeral abduction contracture in children with unresolved neonatal brachial 
      plexus palsy.
PG  - 112-8
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.N.00203 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Following neonatal brachial plexus palsy, the Putti sign-obligatory 
      tilt of the scapula with brachiothoracic adduction-suggests the presence of 
      glenohumeral abduction contracture. In the present study, we utilized magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify this glenohumeral abduction contracture and 
      evaluate its relationship to shoulder joint deformity, muscle atrophy, and 
      function. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed MRIs of the thorax and shoulders 
      obtained before and after shoulder rebalancing surgery (internal rotation 
      contracture release and external rotation tendon transfer) for twenty-eight 
      children with unresolved neonatal brachial plexus palsy. Two raters measured the 
      coronal positions of the scapula, thoracic spine, and humeral shaft bilaterally 
      on coronal images, correcting trigonometrically for scapular protraction on axial 
      images. Supraspinatus, deltoid, and latissimus dorsi muscle atrophy was assessed, 
      blinded to other measures. Correlations between glenohumeral abduction 
      contracture and glenoid version, humeral head subluxation, passive external 
      rotation, and Mallet shoulder function before and after surgery were performed. 
      RESULTS: MRI measurements were highly reliable between raters. Glenohumeral 
      abduction contractures were present in twenty-five of twenty-eight patients, 
      averaging 33° (range, 10° to 65°). Among those patients, abductor atrophy was 
      present in twenty-three of twenty-five, with adductor atrophy in twelve of 
      twenty-five. Preoperatively, greater abduction contracture severity correlated 
      with greater Mallet global abduction and hand-to-neck function. Abduction 
      contracture severity did not correlate preoperatively with axial measurements of 
      glenohumeral dysplasia, but greater glenoid retroversion was associated with 
      worse abduction contractures postoperatively. Surgery improved passive external 
      rotation, active abduction, and hand-to-neck function, but did not change the 
      abduction contracture. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of patients with persistent 
      shoulder weakness following neonatal brachial plexus palsy have glenohumeral 
      abduction deformities, with contractures as severe as 65°. The abduction 
      contracture occurs with abductor atrophy, with or without associated adductor 
      atrophy. This contracture may improve global shoulder abduction by positioning 
      the glenohumeral joint in abduction. Glenohumeral and scapulothoracic kinematics 
      and muscle pathology must be further elucidated to advance an understanding of 
      the etiology and the prevention and treatment of the complex shoulder deformity 
      following neonatal brachial plexus palsy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level 
      IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of 
      evidence.

PG  - 269-73

AB  - Many disorders of the shoulder complex are accompanied by changes in the pattern 
      of scapular motion which is difficult to measure except radiographically. In 
      order to study the three-dimensional motion of the scapula which accompanies arm 
      movements, a technique has been developed using a three-pointed locater which can 
      be applied over three bony landmarks - the acromial angle, the inferior angle, 
      and the root of the scapular spine. The spatial orientation of the locater 
      relative to the trunk was measured using an electromagnetic movement sensor 
      (isotrak) which has been shown to be clinically reliable. Measurements of 
      scapular plane rotations during abduction showed particularly good agreement with 
      published data; variations in measurements of the out-of-plane angles were 
      attributed to difficulties of contacting the acromion reliably when the deltoid 
      muscle was contracted. It is concluded that the system is suitable for clinical 
      use in the study of shoulder pathology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although scapular malpositioning is commonly associated with 
      rotational deficits and risk of injury, modifiable causes of such malpositioning 
      in overhead athletes are not well described. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of 
      this study was to examine the scapulothoracic profile of adolescent baseball 
      players, specifically, pectoralis minor (PM) length. We hypothesized that PM 
      would be shorter in throwing shoulders compared with nonthrowing shoulders. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Forty-nine healthy 
      adolescent baseball players underwent clinical screening of PM lengths in 
      throwing and nonthrowing shoulders by means of previously described, validated 
      techniques. PM measurements were conducted while players were supine with arms at 
      rest, sitting with arms at rest, and sitting with shoulders in maximal external 
      rotation; measurements were made with a digital caliper and by assessment of 
      table-to-acromion distance. Static scapular position and range of motion 
      measurements were recorded. Demographic information and playing history were 
      documented. RESULTS: All players were male, they had a mean ± SD age of 16.2 ± 
      1.16 years, and they predominantly threw right-handed (83.7%). Sixty-nine percent 
      of players were pitchers, 61.2% had played baseball for 9 or more months per 
      year, and 67.3% had played in excess of 30 games in the previous year. 
      Significant differences were noted during side-to-side comparisons within 
      participants. Absolute PM length was significantly shorter in throwing compared 
      with nonthrowing shoulders when measured with players sitting with arms at rest 
      (by 3.7 ± 11.8 mm) and with their shoulders in maximal external rotation (by 4.8 
      ± 15.1 mm) (P < .004 for both). The PM index was significantly reduced in 
      throwing compared with nonthrowing shoulders while players were supine with arms 
      at rest (P = .007), sitting with arms at rest (P = .006), and sitting with 
      shoulders in maximal external rotation (P < .001). Mean table-to-acromion 
      distance was increased 7.7 ± 1.26 mm in throwing versus nonthrowing arms (P < 
      .001). The scapular index was significantly reduced in throwing compared with 
      nonthrowing shoulders (P < .005). CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic adolescent baseball 
      players have significant differences in PM length and static scapular 
      measurements in throwing compared with nonthrowing shoulders. The clinical 
      significance requires further investigation, but emphasis on PM stretching 
      routines is encouraged.

TI  - EFFICACY OF REFLEXIVE NEUROMUSCULAR STABILIZATION DURING TREATMENT OF SCAPULAR 
      DYSKINESIA IN AN OVERHEAD ATHLETE: A CASE REPORT.
PG  - 1073-1082
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Shoulder injuries are common amongst overhead athletes. 
      Dysfunctional motor patterns (scapular dyskinesis) may be the cause or result. 
      Improperly treated, they can sideline athletes or reduce quality of life. Current 
      treatment protocols are lengthy and may result in recurrence. Individualization 
      of treatment is key. Functional tests, like the Selective Functional Movement 
      Assessment (SFMA), help discern and properly identify dysfunction, paving the way 
      for interventions like reflexive neuromuscular stabilization (RNS). RNS focuses 
      on restoring proper motor control and may positively influence healing. The 
      purpose of this case report is to describe an evaluation and treatment strategy 
      for scapular dysfunction in an overhead athlete. CASE DESCRIPTION: The subject 
      was a 16-year-old, multi-sport athlete in the high school setting. He presented 
      with upper back pain during his sophomore baseball season. Clinical findings upon 
      examination included but were not limited to irregular scapular positioning as 
      compared bilaterally, dysfunctional scapular movement patterns, soft tissue 
      muscular irritability and loss of glenohumeral (GH) ROM in internal and external 
      rotation, flexion and abduction. Intervention consisted of a combination of 
      positional release therapy and reflexive neuromuscular stabilization aided by 
      some traditional therapeutic modalities. OUTCOMES: The combination of 
      conservative treatments and RNS provided relief of the subject's symptoms in a 
      shorter time frame, three treatments over the course of six days, than just 
      utilizing traditional protocols. The utilization of the paired treatments 
      resulted in diminished pain, restored ROM and improvement in perceived fluidity 
      (speed and stability) of motion as observed by the clinician. A minimal 
      clinically important difference (MCID) was reported on the disablement of the 
      physically active scale (DPAs) on all follow-up treatments as well as on the 
      numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) after the first and second treatments. The 
      minimal detectable change (MDC) requirement was met on the patient specific 
      functional scale (PSFS) prior to the second and third treatment. The activities 
      measured with the PSFS were: GH flexion, GH abduction and throwing a baseball. 
      DISCUSSION: In this case report, the use of the SFMA along with a traditional 
      orthopedic examination allowed for proper identification and location of the 
      dysfunctional motor patterns. The coupling of a traditional modality like the 
      moist heat pack, with PRT and RNS proved to be a beneficial treatment combination 
      for this subject as it provided a clinically meaningful resolution of his 
      condition. Even though current literature suggests that treatment for scapular 
      dysfunction is comprised of three phases over the course of ten weeks, clinicians 
      should focus on the individualization of the treatment, possibly utilizing novel 
      interventions like PRT and RNS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Case Report.

TI  - The Effects of Fatigue on Muscle Synergies in the Shoulders of Baseball Players.
PG  - 19417381221084982
LID - 10.1177/19417381221084982 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle synergies are defined as the central nervous system's 
      organizational structure for movement. Muscle synergies change after muscular 
      fatigue, with certain synergies assuming the primary role to compensate for 
      fatigue within another muscle synergy. Owing to the high eccentric forces imposed 
      upon the external rotators (ie, posterior rotator cuff), pitchers that continue 
      to throw while fatigued are at a significantly higher risk of shoulder and/or 
      elbow injury; however, the neuromuscular compensation strategies of baseball 
      players in response to fatigue are currently unknown. HYPOTHESIS: Players would 
      utilize the same muscle synergy structure following external rotation (ER) 
      fatigue; however, muscle coefficients of nonfatigued muscles would increase (ie, 
      compensate for the external rotators) after fatigue. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional study conducted in a controlled, laboratory setting. METHODS: 
      Nine players from an intercollegiate competitive club baseball team voluntarily 
      participated in this study. Surface electromyography was used on 14 muscles of 
      the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints of the dominant arm during a reaching 
      protocol. Players completed a baseline reaching protocol (prefatigue), then an ER 
      fatigue protocol until maximum concentric ER was reduced by 40%, and finally 
      repeated the same reaching protocol (postfatigue). Principal component analysis 
      was used to extract muscle synergies, the variance accounted for (VAF) of each 
      synergy, and muscle coefficients. Prefatigue was compared with postfatigue using 
      paired t tests for all dependent variables. RESULTS: Four muscle synergies were 
      extracted for both pre- and postfatigue. The VAF for the ER/abduction synergy 
      decreased significantly (prefatigue, 34.6%; postfatigue, 32.4%; P = 0.03), 
      showing a decreased reliance on ER/abduction during the reaching task after 
      fatigue. Within synergy 1, the pectoralis major muscle coefficient (-0.489 vs 
      -0.552; P = 0.01; effect size = 1.68) decreased significantly from prefatigue to 
      postfatigue, indicating that the pectoralis major assumed more of an antagonist 
      role during ER/abduction. Within synergy 2 (forward reaching), there were no 
      significant changes in VAF or muscle coefficients observed. For the third 
      synergy, muscle coefficients increased for the serratus anterior (P = 0.02) and 
      middle deltoid (P = 0.01), whereas in the fourth synergy, the pectoralis major (P 
      = 0.01) increased and teres major (P = 0.01) and biceps brachii (P = 0.05) muscle 
      coefficients decreased. CONCLUSION: The decreased VAF of the ER/abduction synergy 
      after fatigue indicate that other muscles within that synergy could not fully 
      compensate to maintain function. Interestingly, the changes in muscle 
      coefficients suggest that players relied less on the internal rotation (IR) 
      synergy and more on the cross-body synergy following fatigue. This may be due to 
      imbalances between ER and IR while maintaining balance between cross-abduction 
      and adduction. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clinicians may consider implementing low-load, 
      high-repetition training programs to develop posterior shoulder endurance and 
      prolong the onset of muscular fatigue.

TI  - Shoulder muscle activation strategies differ when lifting or lowering a load.
PG  - 2417-2429
LID - 10.1007/s00421-020-04464-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Lowering a load could be associated with abnormal shoulder and scapular 
      motion. We tested the hypothesis that lowering a load involves different shoulder 
      muscle coordination strategies compared to lifting a load. METHODS: EMG activity 
      of 13 muscles was recorded in 30 healthy volunteers who lifted and lowered a 6, 
      12 or 18 kg box between three shelves. Kinematics, EMG levels and muscle 
      synergies, extracted using non-negative matrix factorization, were analyzed. 
      RESULTS: We found greater muscle activity level during lowering in four muscles 
      (+ 1-2% MVC in anterior deltoid, biceps brachii, serratus anterior and pectoralis 
      major). The movements were performed faster during lifting (18.2 vs. 15.9 cm/s) 
      but with similar hand paths and segment kinematics. The number of synergies was 
      the same in both tasks. Two synergies were identified in ~ 75% of subjects, and 
      one synergy in the others. Synergy #1 mainly activated prime movers' muscles, 
      while synergy #2 co-activated several antagonist muscles. Synergies' structure 
      was similar between lifting and lowering (Pearson's r ≈ 0.9 for synergy #1 and 
      0.7-08 for synergy #2). Synergy #2 was more activated during lowering and 
      explained the greater activity observed in anterior deltoid, serratus anterior 
      and pectoralis. CONCLUSION: Lifting and lowering a load were associated with 
      similar synergy structure. In 3/4 of subjects, lowering movements involved 
      greater activation of a "multiple antagonists" synergy. The other subjects 
      co-contracted all shoulder muscles as a unit in both conditions. These 
      inter-individual differences should be investigated in the occurrence of shoulder 
      musculoskeletal disorders.

TI  - Effects of sex differences on scapular motion during arm elevation.
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1051/sicotj/2015004 [doi]
LID - 9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Scapular motion during arm elevation is frequently evaluated in 
      patients with shoulder disorders because it provides clinically useful 
      information. With the development of measurement devices and improvement in 
      accuracy, comparisons under various conditions have recently been reported. 
      However, in most of these reports, the subjects examined were limited to males, 
      or a mixed population of males and females. Only a few reports have described sex 
      differences. In the current study, we performed three-dimensional dynamic 
      analysis of arm elevation and investigated whether there is a sex difference in 
      scapular motion. METHODS: Subjects included 18 healthy adult males (18 shoulders) 
      and 19 healthy adult females (19 shoulders). Thirty-seven shoulders were on the 
      dominant side. The age range was 20.5 ± 0.03 years. Subjects performed scapular 
      plane arm elevation, and kinematic data were recorded using an electromagnetic 
      tracking device. Scapular upward rotation and internal rotation angles and the 
      posterior tilt angle accompanying arm elevation were calculated from recorded 
      data. Changes in each angle during scapular motion were recorded according to 
      sex. RESULTS: There were sex differences in scapular upward rotation and internal 
      rotation angles. The upward rotation angle was significantly greater in males, 
      whereas the internal rotation angle was significantly greater in females. No sex 
      differences were noted in the scapular posterior tilt angle. DISCUSSION: Findings 
      of this study may serve as basic data for scapular motion during scapular plane 
      elevation in healthy males and females. In addition, it is necessary to evaluate 
      and treat the shoulder while taking sex differences in scapular movement into 
      consideration.

TI  - MRI vs CT-based 2D-3D auto-registration accuracy for quantifying shoulder motion 
      using biplane video-radiography.
PG  - 375-380
LID - S0021-9290(18)30748-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2018.09.019 [doi]
AB  - Biplane 2D-3D registration approaches have been used for measuring 3D, in vivo 
      glenohumeral (GH) joint kinematics. Computed tomography (CT) has become the gold 
      standard for reconstructing 3D bone models, as it provides high geometric 
      accuracy and similar tissue contrast to video-radiography. Alternatively, 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would not expose subjects to radiation and 
      provides the ability to add cartilage and other soft tissues to the models. 
      However, the accuracy of MRI-based 2D-3D registration for quantifying 
      glenohumeral kinematics is unknown. We developed an automatic 2D-3D registration 
      program that works with both CT- and MRI-based image volumes for quantifying 
      joint motions. The purpose of this study was to use the proposed 2D-3D 
      auto-registration algorithm to describe the humerus and scapula tracking accuracy 
      of CT- and MRI-based registration relative to radiostereometric analysis (RSA) 
      during dynamic biplanar video-radiography. The GH kinematic accuracy (RMS error) 
      was 0.6-1.0 mm and 0.6-2.2° for the CT-based registration and 1.4-2.2 mm and 
      1.2-2.6° for MRI-based registration. Higher kinematic accuracy of CT-based 
      registration was expected as MRI provides lower spatial resolution and bone 
      contrast as compared to CT and suffers from spatial distortions. However, the 
      MRI-based registration is within an acceptable accuracy for many clinical 
      research questions.

TI  - Laxity of the normal glenohumeral joint: A quantitative in vivo assessment.
PG  - 66-76
LID - 10.1016/S1058-2746(09)80123-7 [doi]
AB  - It is critical that surgeons comprehend the normal laxity of the glenohumeral 
      joint (1) to assist them in diagnosing conditions of clinical instability and (2) 
      to help define a therapeutic end point for the management of shoulders with 
      excessive stiffness. In clinical practice this joint laxity is judged by standard 
      manual tests. We report a quantitative study of the clinical in vivo laxity of 
      the normal shoulders of eight male volunteers. To our knowledge this is the first 
      time that the laxity revealed on standard manual clinical tests has been 
      quantified in vivo. The relative motions of the humerus and scapula were 
      determined with an electromagnetic spatial tracker. This device was pinned 
      percutaneously to the humerus and scapula of each of eight normal male volunteers 
      of ages 25 to 45 years. An experienced shoulder surgeon carried out standard 
      manual clinical tests of glenohumeral laxity while the resulting displacements of 
      the humeral head relative to the glenoid were measured. Spatial tracker data 
      indicated that for each of the different tests, the positions of the glenohumeral 
      and scapulothoracic joints were reproducible for a given subject and among 
      subjects. Substantial glenohumeral translations were measured during those manual 
      laxity tests in which the joint was not at the limit of its range of motion: the 
      drawer test, 7.8 ± 4.0 mm anterior and 7.9 ± 5.6 mm posterior; the sulcus test, 
      10.6 ± 3.8 mm inferior; and the push-pull test, 9.0 ± 6.3 mm posterior. A minimal 
      translation of 0.3 ± 2.5 mm was measured during the fulcrum test in which the 
      glenohumeral ligaments were under tension. The observed translations were 
      reproducible in each subject's shoulder. On the other hand, there was marked 
      variability among subjects. Even though manual laxity tests are a standard part 
      of the clinical evaluation of the shoulder, our finding that normal glenohumeral 
      joints show substantial translations indicates that translation on clinical 
      manual laxity testing is not in and of itself a sufficient indication for 
      surgical stabilization.

TI  - Serratus Anterior and Lower Trapezius Muscle Activities During Multi-Joint 
      Isotonic Scapular Exercises and Isometric Contractions.
AB  - Context :  Proper scapular function during humeral elevation, such as upward 
      rotation, external rotation, and posterior tilting of the scapula, is necessary 
      to prevent shoulder injury. However, the appropriate intensity of rehabilitation 
      exercise for the periscapular muscles has yet to be clarified. Objective :  To 
      identify the serratus anterior, lower trapezius, infraspinatus, and posterior 
      deltoid muscle activities during 2 free-motion exercises using 3 intensities and 
      to compare these muscle activities with isometric contractions during quadruped 
      shoulder flexion and external rotation and abduction of the glenohumeral joint. 
      Design :  Cross-sectional study. Setting :  Health Science Laboratory. Patients 
      or Other Participants :  A total of 16 uninjured, healthy, active, male college 
      students (age = 19.5 ± 1.2 years, height = 173.1 ± 6.5 cm, weight = 68.8 ± 6.6 
      kg). Main Outcome Measure(s) :  Mean electromyographic activity normalized by the 
      maximal voluntary isometric contraction was analyzed across 3 intensities and 5 
      exercises. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for 
      electromyographic activity of the 4 muscles in each free-motion exercise. Results 
      :  Significant interactions in electromyographic activity were observed between 
      intensities and exercises (P < .05). The quadruped shoulder-flexion exercise 
      activated all 4 muscles compared with other exercises. Also, the modified robbery 
      free-motion exercise activated the serratus anterior, lower trapezius, and 
      infraspinatus compared with the lawn-mower free-motion exercise. However, neither 
      exercise showed a difference in posterior deltoid electromyographic activity. 
      Conclusions :  Three intensities exposed the nature of the periscapular muscle 
      activities across the different exercises. The free-motion exercise in 
      periscapular muscle rehabilitation may not modify serratus anterior, lower 
      trapezius, and infraspinatus muscle activities unless knee-joint extension is 
      limited.

TI  - Three-Dimensional in Vivo Kinematics of the Shoulder during Humeral Elevation.
PG  - 312-326
LID - 10.1123/jab.14.3.312 [doi]
AB  - Shoulder kinematics, including scapular rotation relative to the trunk and 
      humeral rotation relative to the scapula, were examined during humeral elevation 
      in three vertical planes via video analysis of intracortical pins. Helical axis 
      parameters provided an easily interpretable description of shoulder motion not 
      subject to the limitations associated with Cardan/Euler angles. Between 30 and 
      150° of elevation in each plane, the scapula rotated almost solely about an axis 
      perpendicular to the scapula. Additional scapular rotation appeared to support 
      the notion that the scapula moves "toward" the plane of elevation. Humeral 
      rotation took place mainly in the plane of the scapula independent of the plane 
      of elevation. Many parameters of shoulder complex kinematics were quite similar 
      across all planes of elevation, suggesting a consistent movement pattern with 
      subtle differences associated with the plane of elevation.

      Children with Unilateral Cerebral Palsy. A Statistical Parametric Mapping Study.

LID - 482
AB  - Upper limb three-dimensional movement analysis (UL-3DMA) offers a reliable and 
      valid tool to evaluate movement patterns in children with unilateral cerebral 
      palsy (uCP). However, it remains unknown to what extent the underlying motor 
      impairments explain deviant movement patterns. Such understanding is key to 
      develop efficient rehabilitation programs. Although UL-3DMA has been shown to be 
      a useful tool to assess movement patterns, it results in a multitude of data, 
      challenging the clinical interpretation and consequently its implementation. 
      UL-3DMA reports are often reduced to summary metrics, such as average or peak 
      values per joint. However, these metrics do not take into account the continuous 
      nature of the data or the interdependency between UL joints, and do not provide 
      phase-specific information of the movement pattern. Moreover, summary metrics may 
      not be sensitive enough to estimate the impact of motor impairments. Recently, 
      Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) was proposed to overcome these problems. We 
      collected UL-3DMA of 60 children with uCP and 60 typically developing children 
      during eight functional tasks and evaluated the impact of spasticity and muscle 
      weakness on UL movement patterns. SPM vector field analysis was used to analyze 
      movement patterns at the level of five joints (wrist, elbow, shoulder, scapula, 
      and trunk). Children with uCP showed deviant movement patterns in all joints 
      during a large percentage of the movement cycle. Spasticity and muscle weakness 
      negatively impacted on UL movement patterns during all tasks, which resulted in 
      increased wrist flexion, elbow pronation and flexion, increased shoulder external 
      rotation, decreased shoulder elevation with a preference for movement in the 
      frontal plane and increased trunk internal rotation. Scapular position was 
      altered during movement initiation, although scapular movements were not affected 
      by muscle weakness or spasticity. In conclusion, we identified pathological 
      movement patterns in children with uCP and additionally mapped the negative 
      impact of spasticity and muscle weakness on these movement patterns, providing 
      useful insights that will contribute to treatment planning. Last, we also 
      identified a subset of the most relevant tasks for studying UL movements in 
      children with uCP, which will facilitate the interpretation of UL-3DMA data and 
      undoubtedly contribute to its clinical implementation.

TI  - Validation of a new method for assessing scapular anterior-posterior tilt.
PG  - 644-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic tracking systems have enabled some investigators and 
      clinicians to measure tri-planar scapular motion; yet, they are not practical and 
      affordable options for all clinicians. Currently, the ability to affordably 
      quantify scapular motion is limited to monitoring only the motion of scapular 
      upward rotation, with use of a digital inclinometer. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The 
      objective of this study was to determine the criterion-related validity of a 
      modified digital inclinometer when used to measure the motion of scapular 
      anterior-posterior (AP) tilt. MATERIALS & METHODS: Thirteen volunteers, free from 
      any history of shoulder injury, reported for a single testing session. Each 
      subject underwent a brief shoulder and posture examination in order to confirm 
      the absence of pathology. Subjects actively performed clinically relevant amounts 
      of humeral elevation in the scapular plane while in a seated position. An 
      electromagnetic tracking system (Ascension Technology, Burlington, VT) and a 
      modified inclinometer (Pro 360, Baseline®, Fabrication Enterprises, White Plains, 
      NY) were used to acquire scapular AP tilt over the same shoulder motions. 
      Criterion-related validity was determined using Pearson Product Moment 
      correlations. RESULTS: Correlation analyses revealed significant moderate to good 
      associations (r = 0.63 to 0.86, p < 0.01) between scapular AP tilt measures 
      obtained with a digital inclinometer and an electromagnetic tracking system. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A modified digital inclinometer is a moderately valid device to use 
      for the quantification of scapular AP tilt. Further study is warranted to 
      establish reliability and to validate use of the device in patients with shoulder 
      injury or pathology. The modified inclinometer expands the clinician's ability to 
      quantify scapular kinematic motion during the clinical evaluation and 
      rehabilitation process. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3.

TI  - Validation of a 3D CT imaging method for quantifying implant migration following 
      anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty.
LID - 10.1002/jor.25170 [doi]
AB  - Glenoid component loosening remains a common complication following anatomic 
      total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA); however, plain radiographs are unable to 
      accurately detect early implant migration. The purpose of this study was to 
      validate the accuracy of a method of postoperative, three-dimensional (3D) 
      computed tomography (CT) imaging with metal artifact reduction (MAR) to detect 
      glenoid component migration following anatomic TSA. Tantalum bead markers were 
      inserted into polyethylene glenoid components for implant detection on 3D CT. 
      In-vitro validation was performed using a glenoid component placed into a scapula 
      sawbone and incrementally translated and rotated, with MAR 3D CT acquired at each 
      test position. Accuracy was evaluated by root mean square error (RMSE). In-vivo 
      validation was performed on six patients who underwent anatomic TSA, with two 
      postoperative CT scans acquired in each patient and marker-based 
      radiostereometric analysis (RSA) performed on the same days. Glenoid component 
      migration was calculated relative to a scapular coordinate system for both MAR 3D 
      CT and RSA. Accuracy was evaluated by RMSE and paired Student's t-tests. The 
      largest RMSE on in-vitro testing was 0.24 mm in translation and 0.11° in 
      rotation, and on in-vivo testing was 0.47 mm in translation and 1.04° in 
      rotation. There were no significant differences between MAR 3D CT and RSA 
      measurement methods. MAR 3D CT imaging is capable of quantifying glenoid 
      component migration with a high level of accuracy. MAR 3D CT imaging is 
      advantageous over RSA because it is readily available clinically and can also be 
      used to evaluate the implant-bone interface.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Correct positioning of the glenoid component is an important 
      determinant of outcome in shoulder arthroplasty. We describe and assess a new 
      radiological plane of reference for improving the accuracy of glenoid preparation 
      prior to component implantation - the Glenoid Vault Outer Cortex (GvOC) plane. 
      METHODS: One hundred and five CT scans of normal scapulae were obtained. Forty 
      six females and 59 males aged between 22 and 30 years. The accuracy of the GvOC 
      plane was then compared against the current "gold standard" - the scapular border 
      (SB). Measurements of glenoid inclination, version, rotation, and offset were 
      obtained using both the GvOC and SB planes. These were then compared to actual 
      values. RESULTS: The mean difference between version obtained using the GvOC 
      plane and the actual value was 1.8° (-2 to 5, SD 1.6) as compared to 6.7° (-2 to 
      17, SD 4.3) when the SB plane was used, (p < 0.001). The mean difference between 
      estimates of inclination obtained using the GvOC plane and the actual were 1.9° 
      (-4 to 6, SD 1.6) as compared to 11.2° (-4 to 25, SD 6.1) when the SB plane was 
      used, (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The GvOC plane produced estimates of glenoid 
      version and inclination closer to actual values with lower variance than when the 
      SB plane was used. The GvOC may be a more accurate and reproducible radiological 
      method for surgeons to use when defining glenoid anatomy prior to arthroplasty 
      surgery.

TI  - A new approach to the mouse arm syndrome.
PG  - 463-77
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study validates a new computer mouse concept. The tested device 
      is a small mouse with a pivoting pen-shaped handle. The hypothesis behind the 
      design is the assumptions that the pen grip requires less static tension than the 
      normal mouse grip and that fine-motor, high precision tasks normally are done 
      with finger movements with forearm at rest. METHODS: Four muscles were monitored 
      with electromyography (EMG) during work with a new mouse and with a traditional 
      mouse. RESULTS: EMG activity was significant lower, in M. pronator teres--46%, M. 
      extensor digitorum--46%, M. trapezius--69%, and M. levator scapulae--82%, during 
      work with the new mouse as compared to the traditional mouse. CONCLUSION: 
      Altering the design of the computer mouse can significantly reduce muscular 
      tension.

TI  - Effects of rotator cuff tears on muscle moment arms: a computational study.
PG  - 3373-80
AB  - Rotator cuff tears cause morphologic changes to cuff tendons and muscles, which 
      can alter muscle architecture and moment arm. The effects of these alterations on 
      shoulder mechanical performance in terms of muscle force and joint strength are 
      not well understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a three-dimensional 
      explicit finite element model for investigating morphological changes to rotator 
      cuff tendons following cuff tear. The subsequent objectives were to validate the 
      model by comparing model-predicted moment arms to empirical data, and to use the 
      model to investigate the hypothesis that rotator cuff muscle moment arms are 
      reduced when tendons are divided along the force-bearing direction of the tendon. 
      The model was constructed by extracting tendon, cartilage, and bone geometry from 
      the male Visible Human data set. Infraspinatus and teres minor muscle and tendon 
      paths were identified relative to the humerus and scapula. Kinetic and kinematic 
      boundary conditions in the model replicated experimental protocols, which rotated 
      the humerus from 45 degrees internal to 45 degrees external rotation with 
      constant loads on the tendons. External rotation moment arms were calculated for 
      two conditions of the cuff tendons: intact normal and divided tendon. Predicted 
      moment arms were within the 1-99% confidence intervals of experimental data for 
      nearly all joint angles and tendon sub-regions. In agreement with the 
      experimental findings, when compared to the intact condition, predicted moment 
      arms were reduced for the divided tendon condition. The results of this study 
      provide evidence that one potential mechanism for the reduction in strength 
      observed with cuff tear is reduction of muscle moment arms. The model provides a 
      platform for future studies addressing mechanisms responsible for reduced muscle 
      force and joint strength including changes to muscle length-tension operating 
      range due to altered muscle and tendon excursions, and the effects of cuff tear 
      size and location on moment arms and muscle forces.

TI  - The glenohumeral offset ratio: A radiographic study.
PG  - 141-6
LID - 10.1016/S1058-2746(09)80050-5 [doi]
AB  - A systematic method of component selection for total shoulder arthroplasty is 
      needed. The method must take into account the soft-tissue constraints of a 
      degenerative joint and optimize joint biomechanics by placing the joint line in 
      the best possible position. The purpose of our study was to determine 
      radiographically the normal glenohumeral joint line position based on a ratio of 
      distances between the joint line and fixed landmarks on the humerus and scapula. 
      We studied modified anteroposterior radiographs of the glenohumeral joint in 86 
      volunteers (51 men and 35 women; ages ranging from 21 to 47 years). Two 
      measurements were made on each radiograph: (1) the perpendicular distance from 
      the most medial portion of the glenoid to the inferior base of the coracoid 
      process at its attachment to the scapular blade, and (2) the perpendicular 
      distance from the midline of the humeral shaft to the most medial point on the 
      humeral head. The joint line position was described as the ratio of the glenoid 
      measurement to the sum of the two measurements (i.e., the glenohumeral offset 
      ratio). The validity and reliability of glenoid offset measurements were 
      determined by comparing radiographic and anatomic measurements of glenoid offset 
      in cadaveric human scapulae. Radiographs were made with rotational error to 
      determine its effects on the measurement of humeral offset. Humeral offsets and 
      glenoid thicknesses of five different total shoulder systems were then determined 
      from template overlays. The mean glenohumeral offset ratio was 0.31 (range 0.18 
      to 0.39). We detected no significant difference in the ratio between men and 
      women volunteers. There was close agreement between radiographie and direct 
      (anatomic) measurements of glenoid offset in cadaveric scapulae. Values for 
      humeral offset were not significantly affected by radiographic rotational error. 
      The evidence indicates that a fairly constant glenohumeral offset ratio in normal 
      shoulders can be reliably calculated from a single radiograph. In addition to the 
      prosthesis specifications, we suggest that the glenohumeral offset ratio is a 
      potentially useful preoperative planning tool for total shoulder arthroplasty.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Standardized criteria are lacking to guide patient return to sport 
      (RTS) after rotator cuff surgery (RCS) or shoulder stabilization surgery (SSS). 
      PURPOSE: To describe RTS criteria used after RCS and SSS in athletic populations. 
      STUDY DESIGN: Scoping review; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: This scoping review 
      was based on the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses-Scoping Review) guidelines. A total of 5 electronic databases 
      (MEDLINE, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, Embase, Google Scholar Advanced search) and the 
      gray literature were searched for English-language studies that reported at least 
      1 RTS criterion in athletes after shoulder surgery. Studies were assigned to the 
      RCS or SSS subgroup based on the primary procedure performed. Data were extracted 
      and summarized as frequencies or arithmetic mean and standard deviation. RESULTS: 
      Included were 52 studies and 2706 athletes (2206 male, 500 female, with a mean 
      age of 28.8 ± 1.8 years). The RCS group consisted of 14 studies and the SSS group 
      consisted of 38 studies. Time from surgery was the most common RTS criterion 
      reported overall (37/52 studies; 71%) as well as within the RCS (93%) and SSS 
      (63%) subgroups. Muscle strength (25/52 studies; 48%) and range of motion (23/52; 
      44%) were used by almost half of the included articles. RTS criteria reported 
      less often were absence of pain, successful completion of sport-specific or 
      position-specific test, proprioception, radiographic evaluation, patient-surgeon 
      agreement, minimum time required to participate in pain-free throwing, and 
      satisfactory scapulothoracic mechanics. All studies used 1 to 3 of the above RTS 
      criteria; however, the definition of each criterion differed among the included 
      articles. CONCLUSION: Time from surgery was the most commonly reported RTS 
      criterion after RCS or SSS in athletes, whereas muscle strength and range of 
      motion were used by almost half of the articles. There was high heterogeneity in 
      the definition of each RTS criterion used among the included studies, which also 
      used different combinations of 1 to 3 RTS criteria. These results suggest the 
      need to better define quantitative and qualitative RTS criteria in athletes 
      undergoing rotator cuff and shoulder stabilization procedures in order to safely 
      return athletes to sport.

TI  - Chronic Adaptations of Shoulder Muscle Synergies in Healthy Baseball Players.
PG  - 19417381211069564
LID - 10.1177/19417381211069564 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research has demonstrated that muscle synergy structure can 
      adapt owing to training and injury; however, muscle synergies have not been 
      evaluated in baseball players. HYPOTHESIS: The throwing arm would have a similar 
      muscle synergy structure but different levels of individual muscle activity 
      within each synergy, relative to the nonthrowing arm. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional study in a controlled laboratory setting. METHODS: Fourteen 
      healthy competitive baseball players were included. Participants were tested 
      bilaterally during a center-out planar reaching task using the KINARM robot, 
      where kinematic data and surface electromyography data from 14 glenohumeral and 
      scapular muscles were synchronized. Principal component analysis was used to 
      extract muscle synergies, the variance accounted for (VAF) of each synergy, and 
      individual muscle coefficients. The dominant (DOM) arm was compared with the 
      nondominant (NDOM) arm using paired t tests for all dependent variables. RESULTS: 
      The same number of muscle synergies were extracted on the DOM and NDOM arms, 
      along with no differences in VAF. In the first synergy, the infraspinatus (DOM 
      0.798 vs NDOM 0.587, P = 0.038) and lower trapezius (DOM 0.872 vs NDOM 0.480, P = 
      0.005) muscle coefficients significantly increased on the DOM arm. The second 
      synergy had a significantly increased anterior deltoid (DOM 0.764 vs NDOM 0.374, 
      P = 0.003) and a significantly decreased posterior deltoid (DOM -0.069 vs NDOM 
      0.197, P = 0.041) muscle coefficient on the DOM arm. CONCLUSION: The DOM shoulder 
      exhibits a higher proportion of infraspinatus and lower trapezius muscle 
      activation during the external rotation and abduction synergy. Also, the DOM 
      shoulder has increased muscle activation of the teres major and latissimus dorsi 
      during the internal rotation synergy, and increased muscle activation of the 
      pectoralis major during the cross-body adduction synergy, compared with the NDOM 
      shoulder. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: By exploring these neuromuscular adaptations, the 
      improved understanding of muscle synergy adaptations in baseball players will 
      help optimize injury prevention and rehabilitation techniques.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Digital home rehabilitation systems require accurate segmentation 
      methods to provide appropriate feedback on repetition counting and exercise 
      technique. Current segmentation methods are not suitable for clinical use; they 
      are not highly accurate or require multiple sensors, which creates usability 
      problems. We propose a model for accurately segmenting inertial measurement unit 
      data for shoulder rehabilitation exercises. This study aims to use inertial 
      measurement unit data to train and test a machine learning segmentation model for 
      single- and multiple-inertial measurement unit systems and to identify the 
      optimal single-sensor location. METHODS: A focus group of specialist 
      physiotherapists selected the exercises, which were performed by participants 
      wearing inertial measurement units on the wrist, arm and scapula. We applied a 
      novel machine learning based segmentation technique involving a convolutional 
      classifier and Finite State Machine to the inertial measurement unit data. An 
      accuracy score was calculated for each possible single- or multiple-sensor 
      system. RESULTS: The wrist inertial measurement unit was chosen as the optimal 
      single-sensor location for future system development (mean overall accuracy 
      0.871). Flexion and abduction based exercises mostly could be segmented with high 
      accuracy, but scapular movement exercises had poor accuracy. CONCLUSION: A 
      wrist-worn single inertial measurement unit system can accurately segment 
      shoulder exercise repetitions; however, accuracy varies depending on 
      characteristics of the exercise.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of a simple clinical 
      test (subacromial grind test) in diagnosing supraspinatus tendon tears. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: The test is considered positive if palpable crepitus or grinding is 
      detected on passive internal and external rotation of the shoulder while abducted 
      in the scapular plane. Data were collected prospectively on 47 patients 
      undergoing shoulder arthroscopy, and the results of the test and arthroscopy 
      compared. RESULTS: During arthroscopy, 17 patients had full thickness (FT) tears 
      of supraspinatus tendon and 10 had partial thickness tears. For any supraspinatus 
      tear, the sensitivity of the test was 63%, specificity 95%, positive predictive 
      value 94%, negative predictive value 66% and overall accuracy 79%. For FT tears, 
      the sensitivity was 82%, specificity 87%, positive predictive value 78%, negative 
      predictive value 90% and overall accuracy 85%. CONCLUSION: We found that this is 
      a useful single test for diagnosing FT supraspinatus tears. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Level IV diagnostic study.

TI  - Comparison between (18)F-FDG PET/CT and EMG Mapping for Identifying Dystonic 
      Superficial Muscles in Primary Cervical Dystonia: Preliminary Results.
PG  - 33-8
LID - 10.1007/s13139-009-0004-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was conducted to compare (18)F-FDG PET/CT and 
      electromyography (EMG) mapping in patients with primary cervical dystonia (PCD) 
      to find dystonic superficial cervical muscles. METHODS: Ten consecutive patients 
      with PCD (M:F = 5:5, age 44 ± 13 years) whose dystonic posture was not relieved 
      with conventional muscle relaxant therapy were included. Target cervical muscles 
      for the comparison between (18)F-FDG PET/CT and EMG mapping were four 
      representative superficial bilateral cervical muscles: splenius capitis muscle, 
      sternocleidomstoid muscle, upper trapezius muscle, and leavator scapulae muscle. 
      The diagnostic efficacy was compared between (18)F-FDG PET/CT and EMG mapping 
      using physical exam and measurement of rotation angle as the gold standard. 
      RESULTS: Among 80 muscles evaluated, there were 21 (26%) dystonic superficial 
      cervical muscles assessed with physical exam and motion analysis. The 
      sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for localizing dystonic muscles were 76, 
      92, and 88% for (18)F-FDG PET/CT, and 95, 66, and 74% for EMG mapping, 
      respectively. The sensitivity of EMG mapping was significantly higher than that 
      of (18)F-FDG PET/CT. In contrast, (18)F-FDG PET/CT was significantly superior to 
      EMG mapping for specificity and accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FDG PET/CT is more 
      specific and accurate than EMG mapping for finding superficial dystonic cervical 
      muscles. The high sensitivity of EMG mapping suggests that (18)F-FDG PET/CT and 
      EMG mapping are complementary for finding dystonic superficial cervical muscles.

PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1080/09593985.2022.2060885 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Upper quadrant geometrical changes in individuals with chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) appear to have negative influences on 
      geometrical arrangements of the thorax and scapula. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of 
      this systematic review was to assess the impairment of scapular control in 
      individuals with COPD as compared with healthy controls. METHODS: We 
      systematically searched seven electronic databases from inception to June 2021 
      and updated the searches again in December 2021. Eligible studies included the 
      participants with COPD and compared scapular control outcomes (scapular/shoulder 
      kinematic or related muscle activity) with a control group. Two researchers 
      independently searched for, screened, extracted data from, and evaluated the 
      quality of all articles. RESULTS: Seven studies met the inclusion criteria and 
      only five studies with 190 subjects were included in the meta-analyses. Subgroup 
      analyses showed that the control group exhibited more scapular anterior tilt 
      (SMD: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.90) and shoulder flexion (SMD: -1.02; 95% CI: -1.79 
      to -0.26) as compared with the COPD group. Conversely, the COPD group exhibited 
      more scapular elevation (SMD: -1.03; 95% CI: -1.69 to -0.37), internal rotation 
      (SMD: -1.65; 95% CI: -3.19 to -0.10), and protraction (SMD: -0.75; 95% CI: -1.18 
      to -0.32) compared with the control group. All other outcomes revealed 
      non-significant findings. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrated scapular control 
      impairments, such as scapular elevation, internal rotation, protraction, and 
      anterior tilt in a static position in patients with COPD. To validate these 
      findings, high-quality randomized control trials with large sample sizes and 
      reliable outcome measures should be conducted.

TI  - A COMPARISON OF CHANGE IN 3D SCAPULAR KINEMATICS WITH MAXIMAL CONTRACTIONS AND 
      FORCE PRODUCTION WITH SCAPULAR MUSCLE TESTS BETWEEN ASYMPTOMATIC OVERHEAD 
      ATHLETES WITH AND WITHOUT SCAPULAR DYSKINESIS.
PG  - 309-18
AB  - BACKGROUND: The significance of scapular dyskinesis is being challenged due to a 
      lack of the association with pain and ability to predict injury in athletic 
      populations. However, it is unknown whether asymptomatic overhead athletes with 
      dyskinesis cope by normalizing scapular position with higher demand activities. 
      HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare change in scapular 
      kinematics from an active unweighted contraction to a maximal isometric 
      contraction in asymptomatic overhead athletes with and without scapular 
      dyskinesis. Secondarily, force generated with manual muscle tests were explored 
      for differences and relationships with kinematics. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional 
      laboratory study. METHODS: Twenty-five matched asymptomatic overhead athletes 
      with (n=14) and without (n=11) scapular dyskinesis, defined with a reliable and 
      validated clinical method, participated in this study. Three-dimensional scapular 
      kinematics were evaluated in an active unweighted condition, and during maximal 
      isometric contractions at 90 ° of shoulder flexion. Isometric force produced with 
      lower trapezius and serratus anterior manual muscle tests were assessed with a 
      dynamometer. Changes in scapular kinematics were compared between groups. 
      Differences in force generated with manual muscle tests between groups and 
      relationships with kinematics were explored. RESULTS: Athletes with dyskinesis 
      demonstrated greater deficits in scapular upward rotation with maximal 
      contraction (p=<0.001), less external rotation (p=0.036) and weaker lower 
      trapezius manual muscle test strength (p=0.031). Lower trapezius (p=0.003;r=0.57) 
      and serratus anterior (p=0.042;r=0.41) manual muscle test strength deficits were 
      fair to moderately associated with a lack of scapular upward rotation during 
      maximal contraction. CONCLUSION: Small to moderate changes in scapular kinematics 
      are normal responses to a maximal contraction, but with scapular dyskinesis this 
      response is accentuated. Athletes with dyskinesis generate less force with lower 
      trapezius manual muscle testing compared to athletes without dyskinesis. 
      Decreased strength with lower trapezius and serratus anterior manual muscle 
      testing was also related to a lack of upward rotation in all athletes. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: 3.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of the reach distance on 
      the muscle activation during a reach-to-grasp movement in the sitting position. 
      Ten healthy male volunteers were tested. Surface EMG were recorded for the 
      deltoid scapular, the deltoid clavicular, the triceps brachii, the biceps brachii 
      and the brachioradialis. These muscles have been selected for their contribution 
      to the cylindrical palmar prehension motion in the sagittal plane. Three 
      distances have been tested: 20, 30 and 40 cm. For each distance, ten repeated 
      measures have been recorded. From this in vivo data, the repeatability of the 
      protocol has been tested. For this, relative (ICC) and absolute (SEM) 
      reliabilities are determined in order to evaluate the intra operator 
      repeatability of this protocol. It appears that the ICC values obtained are 
      between 0.78 and 0.99 in all the conditions (15 conditions corresponding to three 
      distances and five muscles). The intra operator repeatability is thus confirmed. 
      From these surface EMG recordings the muscle activations have been calculated as 
      the iEMG value. It appears that the muscle activation is greater with increased 
      distances. The results contribute to the identification of the levels of muscle 
      activation amplitude during a simple reach-to-grasp movement that is common in 
      prehension research. This knowledge is essential in order to calculate the muscle 
      forces and to integrate these forces in the prehension models developed nowadays 
      in the robotic, rehabilitation, ergonomics field of research.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. OBJECTIVES: To assess scapular 
      kinematics and electromyographic signal amplitude of the shoulder musculature, 
      before and after thoracic spine manipulation (TSM) in subjects with rotator cuff 
      tendinopathy (RCT). Changes in range of motion, pain, and function were also 
      assessed. BACKGROUND: There are various treatment techniques for RCT. Recent 
      studies suggest that TSM may be a useful component in the management of pain and 
      dysfunction associated with RCT. METHODS: Thirty subjects between 18 and 45 years 
      of age, who showed signs of RCT, participated in this study. Changes in scapular 
      kinematics and muscle activity, as well as changes in shoulder pain and function, 
      were assessed pre-TSM and post-TSM using paired t tests and repeated-measures 
      analyses of variance. RESULTS: TSM did not lead to changes in range of motion or 
      scapular kinematics, with the exception of a small decrease in scapular upward 
      rotation (P = .05). The only change in muscle activity was a small but 
      significant increase in middle trapezius activity (P = .03). After TSM, subjects 
      demonstrated decreased pain during performance of the Jobe empty-can (mean ± SD 
      change, 2.6 ± 1.1), Neer (2.6 ± 1.3), and Hawkins-Kennedy (2.8 ± 1.3) tests (all, 
      P<.001). Subjects also reported decreased pain with shoulder flexion (mean ± SD 
      change, 2.0 ± 1.5; P<.001) and improved shoulder function (force production, 2.5 
      ± 1.4 kg; Penn Shoulder Score, 7.7 ± 9.4; sports/performing arts module of the 
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire, 16.4 ± 13.2) (all, 
      P<.001). CONCLUSION: Immediate improvements in shoulder pain and function 
      post-TSM are not likely explained by alterations in scapular kinematics or 
      shoulder muscle activity. For people with pain associated with RCT, TSM may be an 
      effective component of their treatment plan to improve pain and function. 
      However, further randomized controlled studies are necessary to better validate 
      this treatment approach. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapy, level 4.

TI  - Electromyography of superficial and deep neck muscles during isometric, 
      voluntary, and reflex contractions.
PG  - 66-77
AB  - Increasingly complex models of the neck neuromusculature need detailed muscle and 
      kinematic data for proper validation. The goal of this study was to measure the 
      electromyographic activity of superficial and deep neck muscles during tasks 
      involving isometric, voluntary, and reflexively evoked contractions of the neck 
      muscles. Three male subjects (28-41 years) had electromyographic (EMG) fine wires 
      inserted into the left sternocleidomastoid, levator scapulae, trapezius, splenius 
      capitis, semispinalis capitis, semispinalis cervicis, and multifidus muscles. 
      Surface electrodes were placed over the left sternohyoid muscle. Subjects then 
      performed: (i) maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) in the eight directions (45 
      deg intervals) from the neutral posture; (ii) 50 N isometric contractions with a 
      slow sweep of the force direction through 720 deg; (iii) voluntary oscillatory 
      head movements in flexion and extension; and (iv) initially relaxed reflex muscle 
      activations to a forward acceleration while seated on a sled. Isometric 
      contractions were performed against an overhead load cell and movement dynamics 
      were measured using six-axis accelerometry on the head and torso. In all three 
      subjects, the two anterior neck muscles had similar preferred activation 
      directions and acted synergistically in both dynamic tasks. With the exception of 
      splenius capitis, the posterior and posterolateral neck muscles also showed 
      consistent activation directions and acted synergistically during the voluntary 
      motions, but not during the sled perturbations. These findings suggest that the 
      common numerical-modeling assumption that all anterior muscles act 
      synergistically as flexors is reasonable, but that the related assumption that 
      all posterior muscles act synergistically as extensors is not. Despite the small 
      number of subjects, the data presented here can be used to inform and validate a 
      neck model at three levels of increasing neuromuscular-kinematic complexity: 
      muscles generating forces with no movement, muscles generating forces and causing 
      movement, and muscles generating forces in response to induced movement. These 
      increasingly complex data sets will allow researchers to incrementally tune their 
      neck models' muscle geometry, physiology, and feedforward/feedback 
      neuromechanics.

TI  - A review of resistance exercise and posture realignment.
PG  - 385-90
AB  - Exercise has been promoted in an attempt to correct postural deviations, such as 
      excessive lumbar lordosis, scoliosis, kyphosis, and abducted scapulae. One of the 
      assumed causes of these conditions is a weak and lengthened agonist muscle group 
      combined with a strong and tight antagonist muscle group. Strengthening and 
      stretching exercises have been prescribed accordingly. It is implied that 
      strengthening exercises will encourage adaptive shortening of the muscle-tendon 
      length, reposition skeletal segments, and produce static posture realignment. A 
      review of the literature has found a lack of reliable, valid data collected in 
      controlled settings to support the contention that exercise will correct existing 
      postural deviations. Likewise, objective data to indicate that exercise will lead 
      to postural deviations are lacking. It is likely that exercise programs are of 
      insufficient duration and frequency to induce adaptive changes in muscle-tendon 
      length. Additionally, any adaptations from restricted range-of-movement exercise 
      would likely be offset by daily living activities that frequently require the 
      body segments to go through full ranges of motion.

      with cervical spine dysfunction.
PG  - 388-92
LID - S1678-77572006000500016 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present pilot study was to describe pain complaints 
      of TMD patients and cervical spine dysfunction. METHODS: Fourteen women with 
      myogenous TMD, cervical motion limitation and rotation of at least one of the 
      three first cervical vertebrae evidenced by radiographic examination participated 
      in this study. The multidimensional pain evaluation was accomplished by a 
      Brazilian version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. RESULTS: The results showed 
      that the most painful body site mentioned was cervical spine, followed by 
      scapular region and temporomandibular joint. More than half of the volunteers 
      reported temporal pain pattern as rhythmic, periodic and, or still, intermittent. 
      The majority of the patients classified the pain intensity assessed at the moment 
      of the evaluation as mild to discomforting. Absolute agreement was not observed 
      among volunteers regarding word dimensions used to describe their pain, although 
      a great number of patients chose the descriptor related to tension as the better 
      expression to describe their painful complaint. CONCLUSION: Pain characteristics 
      of TMD patients with cervical spine dysfunction showed cervical spine as a common 
      painful region reported and words related to affective and emotional dimensions 
      of pain perception can be used by these patients to qualify their pain complain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) affects 1%-4% of adolescents in 
      the early stages of puberty, but there is still no effective prediction method. 
      This study aimed to establish a prediction model and validated the accuracy and 
      efficacy of this model in predicting the occurrence of AIS. METHODS: Data was 
      collected from a population-based school scoliosis screening program for AIS in 
      China. A sample of 884 children and adolescents with the radiological lateral 
      Cobb angle ≥ 10° was classified as an AIS case, and 895 non-AIS subjects with a 
      Cobb angle < 10° were randomly selected from the screening system. All selected 
      subjects were screened by visual inspection of clinical signs, the Adam's 
      forward-bending test (FBT), and the measurement of angle of trunk rotation (ATR). 
      LR and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to preliminarily 
      screen the influential factors, and LR models with different adjusted weights 
      were established to predict the occurrence of AIS. RESULTS: Multivariate LR and 
      ROC curves indicated that angle of thoracic rotation (adjusted odds ratios (AOR) 
      = 5.18 - 10.06), angle of thoracolumbar rotation (AOR = 4.67 - 7.22), angle of 
      lumbar rotation (AOR = 6.97 - 8.09), scapular tilt (area under the curve (AUC) = 
      0.77, 95% CI: 0.75-0.80), shoulder-height difference, lumbar concave, and pelvic 
      tilt were the risk predictors for AIS. LR models with different adjusted weights 
      (by AOR, AUC, and AOR+AUC) performed similarly in predicting the occurrence of 
      AIS compared with multivariate LR. The sensitivity (82.55%-83.27%), specificity 
      (82.59%-83.33%), Youden's index (0.65-0.67), positive predictive value 
      (82.85%-83.58%), negative predictive value (82.29%-83.03%), and total accuracy 
      (82.57%-83.30%) manifested that LR could accurately identify patients with AIS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: LR model is a relatively high accurate and feasible method for 
      predicting AIS. Increased performance of LR models using clinically relevant 
      variables offers the potential to early identify high-risk groups of AIS.

      (CoR) is important during alignment of braces and exoskeletons, as a misalignment 
      will introduce undesired forces on the human body. The aim of this research was 
      to develop a new method to estimate the glenohumeral CoR and register the 
      location to the body using a single camera and two printed markers. METHODS: 
      During shoulder anteflexion, the arm roughly describes an arc in the sagittal 
      plane, with the glenohumeral joint in the center. Two binary square-fiducial 
      ArUco markers were secured to the upper arm and the scapula, their position and 
      orientation were obtained, and a sphere was fitted to the coordinates of the arm 
      marker. The sphere center position was then registered on the skin. The accuracy 
      was assessed with a test bench with a known rotational center. The repeatability 
      was assessed in vivo with five healthy participants. RESULTS: The mean absolute 
      offset between the true CoR of the test bench and the fitted sphere centers 
      across multiple trials was 2.7 mm at a velocity of 30 degrees/s, and 2.5 mm at 60 
      degrees/s. The root mean squared distance from the estimated sphere centers after 
      each trial to the mean sphere center across all trials per participant was 5.1 mm 
      on average for the novice examiner and 5.2 mm for the expert examiner. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is able to accurately and precisely estimate the 
      glenohumeral CoR.

AB  - To classify mosquito species based on common features of their habitats, samples 
      were obtained fortnightly between June 2001-October 2003 in the subtropical 
      province of Chaco, Argentina. Data on the type of larval habitat, nature of the 
      habitat (artificial or natural), size, depth, location related to sunlight, 
      distance to the neighbouring houses, type of substrate, organic material, 
      vegetation and algae type and their presence were collected. Data on the 
      permanence, temperature, pH, turbidity, colour, odour and movement of the larval 
      habitat's water were also collected. From the cluster analysis, three groups of 
      species associated by their degree of habitat similarity were obtained and are 
      listed below. Group 1 consisted of Aedes aegypti. Group 2 consisted of Culex 
      imitator, Culex davisi, Wyeomyia muehlensi and Toxorhynchites haemorrhoidalis 
      separatus. Within group 3, two subgroups are distinguished: A (Psorophora ferox, 
      Psorophora cyanescens, Psorophora varinervis, Psorophora confinnis, Psorophora 
      cingulata, Ochlerotatus hastatus-oligopistus, Ochlerotatus serratus, Ochlerotatus 
      scapularis, Culex intrincatus, Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex pilosus, 
      Ochlerotatus albifasciatus, Culex bidens) and B (Culex maxi, Culex eduardoi, 
      Culex chidesteri, Uranotaenia lowii, Uranotaenia pulcherrima, Anopheles 
      neomaculipalpus, Anopheles triannulatus, Anopheles albitarsis, Uranotaenia 
      apicalis, Mansonia humeralis and Aedeomyia squamipennis). Principal component 
      analysis indicates that the size of the larval habitats and the presence of 
      aquatic vegetation are the main characteristics that explain the variation among 
      different species. In contrast, water permanence is second in importance. Water 
      temperature, pH and the type of larval habitat are less important in explaining 
      the clustering of species.

TI  - Co-creation of an exercise inventory to improve scapular stabilization and 
      control among individuals with rotator cuff-related shoulder pain: a survey-based 
      study amongst physiotherapists.
PG  - 11

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scapular stabilization exercises (SSE) are often included in the 
      treatment of individuals with rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (RCRSP) to 
      decrease pain and improve function. These SSE typically aim to strengthen the 
      scapular muscles and optimize dynamic neuromuscular control of the scapula, which 
      may improve overall shoulder stability and movement quality. No consensus of the 
      recommended SSE for the management of RCRSP is available. Hence, this study aimed 
      to consult physiotherapists to co-create an inventory of recommended SSE based on 
      the exercise's relevance and frequency of prescriptions for the rehabilitation of 
      individuals with RCRSP. METHODS: A group of 16 physiotherapists with experience 
      in treating shoulder pain participated in a sequential consultation incorporating 
      two distinct rounds of consultation focusing on SSE (modified Delphi design). In 
      round 1, physiotherapists identified and demonstrated up to 10 SSE that they 
      commonly recommend or use among individuals with RCRSP. The description and 
      performance of all SSE were audio and video recorded. All SSE suggested by more 
      than one participant in round 1 advanced to round 2. In round 2, physiotherapists 
      rated these SSE on a 4-point Likert scale according to their perceived relevance 
      and frequency of prescription for this population. RESULTS: In round 1, out of 
      the 25 SSE recommended by participants, 19 SSE (76.0%) were recommended by more 
      than one physiotherapist and advanced to round 2. In round 2, 13 SSE were 
      consensually classified (agreement ≥75%) as being relevant for the rehabilitation 
      of individuals with RCRSP. SSE targeting the recruitment of the serratus anterior 
      and lower trapezius muscles were considered the most relevant for the management 
      of RCRSP, whereas SSE targeting neuromuscular scapular control were the most 
      prescribed SSE for the management of RCRSP. CONCLUSIONS: An inventory composed of 
      13 SSE was co-created by physiotherapists based on their relevance and frequency 
      of prescription for the rehabilitation of individuals with RCRSP. When designing 
      an exercise program, physiotherapists can use this SSE inventory to inform their 
      exercise selection, in combination with their current knowledge on shoulder 
      rehabilitation, as well as patients' preferences.

TI  - The Role of the Long Head of the Biceps Tendon in Posterior Shoulder 
      Stabilization during Forward Flexion.
LID - S1058-2746(22)00146-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2021.12.026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of the long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) in glenohumeral 
      stability is not fully understood. Most objects are lifted in the sagittal plane 
      with forward flexion, which stresses the posterior aspect of the unconstrained 
      glenohumeral joint. Determining the mechanism by which the shoulder maintains 
      stability with functional motions is important to understanding the pathoanatomy 
      of degenerative shoulders. Our hypothesis was that the LHBT resists posterior 
      translation of the humeral head (HH) during forward flexion by tensioning the 
      posterior capsuloligamentous complex. METHODS: Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric 
      shoulders were tested using an established shoulder simulator which loads the 
      LHBT, rotator cuff and deltoid tendons through a system of pulleys. A motion 
      tracking system recorded glenohumeral translations with an accuracy of ±0.2mm. In 
      each subject, the scapula was fixed and the humerus was tested in 6 positions: 30 
      and 60 degrees of glenohumeral forward flexion at i) maximum internal rotation 
      (IR), ii) neutral rotation and iii) maximum external rotation (ER). The deltoid 
      was loaded with 100N, and the infraspinatus and subscapularis were loaded with 
      22N each. The difference in glenohumeral translation was calculated at each 
      position comparing the LHBT loaded with 45N or unloaded. RESULTS: At 30 degrees 
      of glenohumeral forward flexion, unloading the LHBT increased humeral head (HH) 
      posterior translation by 2.5mm (±0.9mm) (p<0.001), 1.7mm (±1.0mm) (p<0.001) and 
      1.0mm (±0.9mm) (p=0.01) at maximum ER, neutral rotation and maximum IR, 
      respectively. At 60 degrees of glenohumeral forward flexion, unloading the LHBT 
      increased HH posterior translation by 2.8mm (±1.2mm) (p<0.001), 2.4mm (±1.6mm) 
      (p<0.001) and 1.7mm (±1.4mm) (p<0.001) at maximum ER, neutral rotation and 
      maximum IR, respectively. CONCLUSION: LHBT loading resists posterior translation 
      of the humeral head during forward flexion. This data supports the role of the 
      LHBT as a posterior stabilizer of the shoulder, specifically when a person is 
      carrying objects in front of them. Further work is needed to determine if 
      unloading the LHBT, as is done with biceps tenotomy or tenodesis, may eventually 
      lead to posterior labral pathology, or to the posterior glenoid wear commonly 
      seen with osteoarthritis.

TI  - An Er:YAG laser bone cutting manipulator for precise rotational acetabular 
      osteotomy.
PG  - 2750-3
AB  - Rotational acetabular osteotomy (RAO) has an important advantage in that surgical 
      bony defects are reconstructed with a patients' own tissue. We propose a surgical 
      robot for the RAO using Er:YAG laser irradiating mounted on iliac bone to operate 
      RAO precisely and to reduce recovery and trauma. A water-cooling Er:YAG laser (30 
      J/cm/sup 2/, l=2.94 mum, 20 Hz, 200 msec) that used optical fiber was operated 
      4-8 irradiation-overlapping ratio. We kept the distance between the laser and the 
      bone at 0.25 mm using force sensor and spring to maintain effective ablation. 
      Swine scapulae were ablated and performance was evaluated. The manipulator was 
      operated mounting on iliac bone to get a filed position whereby resulting in 
      precise bone cutting. The precision of the manipulator was within 0.3 mm and the 
      efficiency of laser bone ablations per unit time optimized to 0.21 mm/sup 3//secW 
      at the overlapping ratio of the irradiation area was 0.8, meaning a given ablated 
      area was irradiated five times. The troughs showed m charring at this condition 
      and the temperature of the surface was raised to 41.3 degrees C and it lasted 
      only 5 seconds. We are sure that this research will be applied to orthopedics in 
      the near future.

TI  - The Use of Scapular Bone Flaps During Head-and-Neck Reconstruction: Functional, 
      Orthopedic, and Quality of Life Analyses of Flap-Harvest-Related Deficits.
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0000000000008472 [doi]
AB  - The authors sought correlations between harvesting of the scapular bone tip free 
      flap used for head-and-neck reconstruction and any shoulder function deficit, 
      particularly at the level of the rotator cuff. The flap permits reconstruction of 
      large and diverse regions of the head and neck, but long-term harvest morbidity 
      has not been investigated extensively. The authors analyzed the clinical records 
      of all patients who underwent head-and-neck reconstructions using free scapular 
      tip flaps in our department over the past 5 years. The inclusion criteria were 
      complete clinical and radiological documentation and follow-up for at least 
      12 months. Two populations, a surgical and control population, were analyzed. All 
      patients in both populations underwent the simple shoulder test, an 
      internationally validated self-administered test that highlights functional 
      shoulder deficits, and 3 additional tests at orthopedic visits: the external 
      rotation test, Patte test, and external rotation lag sign test. A head-and-neck 
      cancer-specific questionnaire (University of Washington Quality of Life, version 
      4) was completed by the surgical patients. All statistical analyses were 
      performed using Software IBM SPSS Statistics (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).A total of 
      19 patients met the inclusion criteria: 11 males (57.8%) and 8 females (42.2%) of 
      mean age 60.9 years (range 23-75 years). In addition, 20 age-and sex-matched 
      volunteers with no history of shoulder pathology were evaluated in terms of 
      shoulder functionality. The average score on the simple shoulder test was 10.55 
      in the healthy population versus 8.31 in the study population (P < 0.001); in 
      particular, shoulder strength differed between the groups. Similarly, the 
      orthopedic examinations revealed clinically significant differences between the 
      controls and patients on the Patte test and external rotation lag sign test (both 
      P < 0.001), but not the external rotation test (P > 0.001). The mean University 
      of Washington Quality of Life was 73.39; most patients reported good quality of 
      life (52.6%), followed by very good (15.7%).The free scapular bone tip flap is 
      valuable for reconstruction of head-and-neck defects; the long and reliable 
      vascular pedicle allows rapid patient mobilization. Morbidity was confined to 
      small reductions in shoulder strength and external rotation, which do not affect 
      quality of life.

TI  - Ultrasound Screening for Posterior Shoulder Dislocation in Infants with 
      Persistent Brachial Plexus Birth Palsy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early detection of posterior shoulder dislocation in infants with 
      brachial plexus birth palsy (BPBP) is essential, but it may be difficult to 
      accomplish with physical examination alone. The aim of this study was to 
      determine the prevalence of shoulder dislocation in patients with BPBP using 
      ultrasound and to identify which physical examination measurements correlated 
      most with dislocation in these patients. METHODS: This study was a retrospective 
      review of data obtained in an ultrasound screening program of infants with BPBP 
      born from January 2011 to April 2014. Physical examination included the use of 
      the Active Movement Scale (AMS) and measurement of passive external rotation of 
      the shoulder. Ultrasound measurements included PHHD (percentage of the humeral 
      head displaced posterior to the axis of the scapula) and the alpha angle 
      (intersection of the posterior scapular margin with a line tangential to the 
      humeral head through the glenoid). Shoulder dislocation was defined as both a 
      PHHD of >0.5 and an alpha angle of >30°. RESULTS: Of sixty-six infants who had 
      undergone a total of 118 ultrasound examinations (mean, 1.8; range, 1 to 5), 19 
      (29%) demonstrated shoulder dislocation with the shoulder positioned in internal 
      rotation; the dislocation was first detected between 2.1 and 10.5 months of age. 
      Infants with a dislocated shoulder demonstrated significantly less mean passive 
      external rotation in adduction (mean, 45.8° versus 71.4°, p < 0.001) and a 
      greater difference between internal rotation and external rotation AMS scores 
      (mean, 5.5-point versus 3.3-point difference, p < 0.001) than those without 
      shoulder dislocation. Passive external rotation in adduction was a better measure 
      for discriminating between dislocation and no dislocation (area under receiver 
      operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.89) than was the difference between 
      internal and external rotation AMS scores (AUC = 0.73). A cutoff of 60° of 
      passive external rotation in adduction (≤60° versus° >60) yielded a sensitivity 
      of 94% and a specificity of 69%. CONCLUSIONS: Shoulder dislocation is common in 
      infants with BPBP; 29% of the infants presenting to our tertiary care center had 
      a dislocation during their first year of life. Ultrasound shoulder screening is 
      appropriate for infants with BPBP. If passive external rotation in adduction is 
      used to determine which infants should undergo ultrasound, ≤60° should be 
      utilized as the criterion to achieve appropriate sensitivity. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of 
      levels of evidence.

TI  - Scapular-Positioning Patterns During Humeral Elevation in Unimpaired Shoulders.
PG  - 12-17
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess scapular-positioning patterns using a static measurement 
      technique. DESIGN AND SETTING: We used a 4-within-factor design to compare 
      scapular upward rotation among subjects. The within factors included side 
      (dominant, nondominant), plane of motion (scapular, sagittal), direction of 
      motion (ascending, descending), and level of humeral rotation (rest, 30 degrees, 
      60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees ). SUBJECTS: Twenty-seven subjects with 
      unimpaired shoulders. MEASUREMENTS: We measured scapular position and 
      glenohumeral range of motion using a digital inclinometer and goniometer, 
      respectively. All measurements were performed bilaterally. RESULTS: 
      Between-session repeatability was poor to excellent depending on 
      humeral-elevation angle. The scapular plane demonstrated significantly more 
      scapular upward rotation than did the sagittal plane at 120 degrees of humeral 
      elevation. CONCLUSIONS: The scapula demonstrated a consistent pattern of downward 
      rotation initially from rest to 30 degrees of humeral elevation, followed by an 
      upward rotation after 30 degrees of humeral elevation to the highest level (120 
      degrees ). Scapular upward rotation is greater in the scapular plane than in the 
      sagittal plane. Therefore, overhead rehabilitation exercises should be performed 
      in the scapular plane, especially in subjects with rotator cuff tendinopathy.

TI  - Measurement of insulin pulsatility by sampling directly from the portal vein: a 
      surgical model for placement of long-term prehepatic vascular sampling catheters.
PG  - 202-5
AB  - A practical and repeatable method for measurement of pulsatile insulin release in 
      the dog was developed by direct, chronic cannulation of the portal vein cephalad 
      to the pancrease and the entry point of the cranial pancreaticoduodenal vein, 
      with subsequent exteriorization of the sampling catheter. Mixed breed male dogs 
      of various body weights and ages underwent midline laparotomy for exposure of the 
      portal vein system. After exposure the portal vein was dissected free and 
      cannulated through a purse-string suture placed just caudad (approximately 1 cm) 
      to the entry point of the cranial pancreaticoduodenal vein with a cuffed, medical 
      grade, silastic catheter. The catheter was advanced cranial to a point just 
      distal to the level of the liver and secured in place via the purse-string suture 
      and a single stay suture. The catheter was then passed through the dorsolateral 
      abdominal wall and routed subcutaneously to a point between the shoulder blades. 
      After catheter plug attachment the catheter was tested for patency, flushed, 
      heparin locked, then was secured to the subcutaneous tissue between the scapulas. 
      The dorsal skin wound and abdominal incision were closed in a routine manner, and 
      the dogs recovered from anesthesia. Catheter patency and function in all dogs 
      were maintained for periods up to 4 weeks. No postoperative complications such as 
      catheter tract infections occurred, maintenance was minimal, and all dogs were 
      afforded complete freedom of movement and activity throughout the study, with no 
      requirement for cumbersome jackets or wraps.

TI  - Nonoperative Management of Traumatic Acromioclavicular Joint Injury: A Clinical 
      Commentary with Clinical Practice Considerations.
PG  - 519-540
LID - 10.26603/001c.32545 [doi]
AB  - Traumatic injuries of the acromioclavicular joint result in pain and potentially 
      long-term alterations in scapulohumeral rhythm that occurs due to disruption of 
      the clavicular strut function which is integral to scapular kinematics. 
      Nonoperative treatment remains a valid option in most acromioclavicular joint 
      injuries with the potential of minimizing pain and restoring scapulohumeral 
      rhythm. However, few studies have provided nonoperative treatment details. 
      Therefore, the purpose of this clinical commentary is to discuss the rationale, 
      indications, and techniques of nonoperative treatment and present an organized 
      approach for evaluating and managing such patients based on the best available 
      evidence. Attention will be focused on identifying the treatment methods employed 
      and the results/outcomes of such treatments. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.

TI  - Local and Widespread Pressure Pain Hyperalgesia Is Not Side Specific in Females 
      with Unilateral Neck Pain that Can Be Reproduced during Passive Neck Rotation.
LID - 10.3390/jcm8081246 [doi]
LID - 1246
AB  - Current evidence for widespread hyperalgesia in non-specific neck pain (NSNP) is 
      unclear. It is currently recommended to group NSNP patients according to 
      pain-provoking movements. The aim of this study was to investigate local and 
      widespread pain sensitivity in females with unilateral NSNP that is reproducible 
      during passive neck rotation compared with matched controls, and to compare the 
      side specific effect of pain location on pressure pain sensitivity among females 
      with unilateral NSNP. Thirty-six females with unilateral NSNP evoked during 
      passive ipsilateral (n = 20) or contralateral (n = 16) rotation toward the 
      painful side were compared with 20 controls. Participants reported their pain 
      intensity at rest and during passive neck rotation and completed the Neck 
      Disability Index. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were assessed bilaterally over 
      the anterior scalene; the sternocleidomastoid; the levator scapulae; lateral to 
      the spinous process of C6; the median, ulnar, and radial nerves; and the tibialis 
      anterior. The ANOVA revealed lower PPTs in females with unilateral NSNP compared 
      with the controls (all at p < 0.001), but no differences were found between the 
      sides, nor was there any Group × side interaction. Among females with NSNP, those 
      with higher pain intensity during ipsilateral rotation toward the painful side 
      showed lower PPTs over the anterior scalene, median nerve, ulnar nerve, and 
      tibialis anterior (all, p < 0.05) than females with higher pain intensity during 
      contralateral rotation toward the painful side. These findings demonstrated 
      bilateral local and widespread pressure pain hyperalgesia in females with 
      unilateral NSNP that was reproducible during passive neck rotation compared with 
      controls. There was no side specific effect of pain location on PPTs among 
      females with unilateral NSNP.

TI  - [Surgical treatment of anterosuperior impingement of the shoulder].
PG  - 418-429
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Therapy of intraarticular lesions and elimination of structural risk 
      factors for those suffering from clinical manifest anterosuperiorer impingement 
      (ASI) of the shoulder. This includes as a maximum version the arthroscopic repair 
      of supraspinatus (SST) and subscapularis tendon (SCT) tears with subsequent 
      subpectoral tenodesis of the long head of the biceps tendon (LBT) and 
      arthroscopic coracoplasty. INDICATIONS: Clinical manifest anterosuperiorer 
      impingement of the shoulder with anterior shoulder pain, failed conservative 
      treatment and clear intraarticular damage in radiological imaging. This involves 
      in detail lesions of the SST, SCT and damage to the LBT. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Lack 
      of structural intraarticular lesions or massive osteoarthritis. Persistent 
      dysfunction of active and passive glenohumeral and scapulathoracal motion, due to 
      neurologic deficits or stiff shoulder. A hypertrophic or deformed healed coracoid 
      process is seen as a structural risk factor for suffering from ASI and should be 
      addressed surgically when causing impingement. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Arthroscopic 
      tenotomy of the LBT with subsequent repair of the SST and SCT. Arthroscopic 
      coracoplasty if indicated and subpectoral tenodesis of the long head of the 
      biceps. POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: No biceps activity and intermittent 
      immobilization in sling for 6 weeks. Limitation of abduction, flexion and 
      external rotation for 6 weeks depending on rotator cuff tendon repair. Start of 
      sport-specific training after 3 months, over-head sports 6 months 
      postoperatively. RESULTS: The arthroscopic repair of anterosuperior rotator cuff 
      tears provides reliable results for improvement in function, decreases in pain

AB  - Realistic muscle path representation is essential to musculoskeletal modeling of 
      joint function. Algorithms predicting these muscle paths typically rely on a 
      labor intensive predefinition of via points or underlying geometries to guide 
      wrapping for given joint positions. While muscle wrapping using anatomically 
      precise three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) models of bone and muscle has 
      been achieved, computational expense and pre-processing associated with this 
      approach exclude its use in applications such as subject-specific modeling. With 
      the intention of combining advantageous features of both approaches, an 
      intermediate technique relying on contact detection capabilities of commercial FE 
      packages is presented. We applied the approach to the glenohumeral joint, and 
      validated the method by comparison against existing experimental data. Individual 
      muscles were modeled as a straight series of deformable beam elements and bones 
      as anatomically precise 3D rigid bodies. Only the attachment locations and a 
      default orientation of the undeformed muscle segment were pre-defined. The joint 
      was then oriented in a static position of interest. The muscle segment free end 
      was then moved along the shortest Euclidean path to its origin on the scapula, 
      wrapping the muscle along bone surfaces by relying on software contact detection. 
      After wrapping for a given position, the resulting moment arm was computed as the 
      perpendicular distance from the line of action vector to the humeral head center 
      of rotation. This approach reasonably predicted muscle length and moment arm for 
      27 muscle segments when compared to experimental measurements over a wide range 
      of shoulder motion. Artificial via points or underlying contact geometries were 
      avoided, contact detection and multiobject wrapping on the bone surfaces were 
      automatic, and low computational cost permitted wrapping of individual muscles 
      within seconds on a standard desktop PC. These advantages may be valuable for 
      both general and subject-specific musculoskeletal modeling.

TI  - Revision arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: repair integrity and clinical outcome.
PG  - 590-8
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.I.00267 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Literature regarding the outcomes of revision rotator cuff repair is 
      limited. The purposes of the present study were to report the tendon repair 
      integrity and clinical outcomes for a cohort of patients following revision 
      arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and to examine factors related to tendon healing 
      and the influence of healing on clinical outcomes. METHODS: Twenty-one of 
      twenty-nine consecutive revision arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs with a minimum 
      of two years of postoperative follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. Outcomes 
      were evaluated on the basis of a visual analog pain scale, the range of motion of 
      the shoulder, the Simple Shoulder Test, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons 
      score, and the Constant score. Ultrasonography was used to examine repair 
      integrity at a minimum of one year following surgery. Ten shoulders underwent 
      arthroscopic repair of a recurrent single-tendon posterior rotator cuff tear, 
      whereas eleven shoulders had repair of both the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. 
      RESULTS: The mean age of the twenty-one subjects was 55.6 years; thirteen 
      subjects were male and eight were female. Complete preoperative and postoperative 
      clinical data were available for nineteen subjects after an average duration of 
      follow-up of thirty-three months. Significant improvements were seen in terms of 
      postoperative pain (p < 0.05), the Simple Shoulder Test score (p < 0.05), the 
      American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons function (p < 0.05) and total scores (p < 
      0.05), active forward elevation (p < 0.05), and active external rotation (p < 
      0.05). Postoperative ultrasound data were available for all twenty-one shoulders 
      after a mean duration of follow-up of twenty-five months. Ten (48%) of the 
      twenty-one shoulders had an intact repair. Seven (70%) of the ten single-tendon 
      repairs were intact, compared with three (27%) of the eleven 
      supraspinatus/infraspinatus repairs (p = 0.05). Patient age (p < 0.05) and the 
      number of torn tendons (p = 0.05) had significant effects on postoperative tendon 
      repair integrity. Shoulders with an intact repair had better postoperative 
      Constant scores (p < 0.05) and scapular plane elevation strength (p < 0.05) in 
      comparison with those with a recurrent tear. CONCLUSIONS: Revision arthroscopic 
      rotator cuff repair results in reliable pain relief and improvement in shoulder 
      function in selected cases. Approximately half of the revision repairs can be 
      expected to be intact at a minimum of one year following surgery. Patient age and 
      the number of torn tendons are related to postoperative tendon integrity. The 
      postoperative integrity of the rotator cuff can have a significant influence on 
      shoulder abduction strength and the Constant score.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to verify the assumption that the 
      three-dimensional (3-D) shoulder motions can be described by means of an 
      interpolation of statically recorded postures and thus, support the application 
      of non-invasive but static techniques for motion analysis of the shoulder. 
      BACKGROUND: During shoulder motions the scapula moves underneath the skin. 
      Recording of motions is only possible by means of invasive methods. An 
      alternative for the recording is palpation of skeletal landmarks on the scapula 
      and subsequent digitization. The method is non-invasive and relatively easy, but 
      static. Motions are modelled by means of interpolation of the subsequent position 
      recordings. Validity of this method, however, has never been demonstrated. 
      METHODS: Seven subjects performed an alternating abduction-adduction motion of 
      the arm in a plane 30 degrees forward rotated with respect to the frontal plane, 
      at three sub-maximal frequencies: 0.04, 0.25 and 0.50 Hz. The humeral and 
      scapular motions were recorded by means of a two-dimensional (2-D) X-ray video 
      system. The motions of the humerus, the scapular spine and the glenoid ridge were 
      defined by angles, and the sinusoidal motion curves were characterized by means 
      of the offset, the amplitude and the phase of the motions. RESULTS: By means of 
      Repeated Measurements Multi-Variate Analysis of Variance, a significant effect of 
      arm motion on the phase and the amplitude of the scapular motion was found. 
      However, the magnitude of the effects are negligibly small for the present 
      applications at sub-maximal arm motion velocities. CONCLUSIONS: For normal arm 
      motions in the vertical plane, the kinematics of the shoulder skeleton can be 
      derived by the interpolation of statically recorded positions of the bones. 
      RELEVANCE: The 3-D motions of the shoulder are the result of the kinematic 
      constraints of the skeletal system and the coordinated muscle forces, and are 
      only one of the few characteristics that can be quantified. The motions contain 
      relevant information which is essential in the analysis of clinical disorders, 
      e.g. sub-acromial disorders and glenohumeral subluxation, the evaluation of 
      clinical interventions and physiotherapy, and in the analysis of ergonomic and 
      biomechanical problems.

TI  - Rotator cuff irreparability or failure of repair (re-tear): technical note on 
      middle trapezius tendon transfer for reproduction of supraspinatus function.
PG  - 105
LID - 10.1186/s40634-021-00426-y [doi]
LID - 105
AB  - PURPOSE: Based on its close anatomic features and nearly-collinear force vector 
      to those of supraspinatus muscle, the current article describes a technique of 
      middle trapezius tendon transfer for reproduction of supraspinatus function in 
      the context of rotator cuff irreparability/re-tear management. METHODS: While 
      seating the patient in beach-chair position, arthroscopic gleno-humeral 
      examination and sub-acromial decompression are initially performed. Hamstring 
      tendons are harvested and fashioned as flattened quadruple sheet. Through 
      McKenzie approach, infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons are repaired. Then, 
      medial half of middle trapezius insertion tendon is harvested from most medial 
      5-6 cm of the scapular spine. Through McKenzie approach, hamstring sheet is 
      retrieved via a sub-trapezius/sub-acromial corridor from the scapular wound. 
      Hamstring sheet is re-attached to cuff footprint by double row/suture bridge 
      repair configuration. While retracting the scapula and placing gleno-humeral 
      joint in 45(O)-abduction/45(O)-external rotation, hamstring sheet is re-attached 
      to released middle trapezius tendon by non-absorbable sutures. Finally, tendon 
      reconstruct is dynamically-tested in different positions of range of motion. 
      RESULTS: Transfer of medial portion of middle trapezius insertion tendon 
      (lengthened by interposition hamstring tendon sheet) to cuff footprint was 
      technically feasible. Dynamic testing showed smooth sub-acromial gliding motion 
      of the tendon reconstruct. CONCLUSION: For reproduction of supraspinatus 
      function, hamstring tendon augmented-middle trapezius tendon transfer to cuff 
      footprint heralds a number of technical and biomechanical advantages; thus 
      offering a potential effective modality of cuff irreparability/re-tear management 
      in relatively young patients of high functional demands. However, current 
      description should be investigated in further biomechanical and clinical studies 
      to validate its long-term outcomes.

TI  - Clavicular-Sided Tears Were the Most Frequent Mode of Failure During 
      Biomechanical Analysis of Acromioclavicular Ligament Complex Failure During 
      Adduction of the Scapula.
PG  - e1723-e1728
LID - 10.1016/j.asmr.2021.07.031 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the force and failure pattern 
      of the acromioclavicular ligament complex (ACLC) in an adducted scapula, 
      potentially simulating an indirect force injury of the AC joint. By using a 
      biomechanical simulation in which the scapula is moved and the clavicle is fixed, 
      we are able to better replicate the in vivo motion of the joint. METHODS: Ten 
      cadaveric shoulders (mean age of 62.0 ± 8.6) with a bone mineral density of .51 ± 
      .18 g/cm(2) were used. A standard reproducible anatomic mounting system was used 
      to secure the clavicle and move the scapula. Displacement control was used to 
      adduct the scapula (inferior angle of the scapula moving toward the clavicle) 
      with the clavicle fixed until specimen failure, producing torque and angle of 
      rotation. The failure mode of the ACLC during this simulated adduction was 
      analyzed with slow motion video analysis. Tears of the ACLC were characterized as 
      clavicular, midline, or acromion-sided tears. RESULTS: The mean torque required 
      for load to failure was found to be 27.75 N-m (95% CI [20.85 N-m, 34.65 N-m]). 
      The mean rotary angle at failure was 30° (95% CI [25°, 35°]). The mean stiffness 
      (resistance provided by the ACLC) was 1.64 N-m/° (95% CI [1.28 N-m/°, 2.01 
      N-m/°]. Mode of failure analysis showed there were 6 clavicle-sided tears, 1 
      acromion-sided tear, 2 acromion fractures, and 1 clavicle fracture. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Clavicular side tears were the most frequent mode of failure compared to midline 
      and acromion side tears. The first segment of the ACLC to fail most frequently 
      during adduction was the posterosuperior ligament. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This 
      biomechanical study simulates a potential mechanism of AC ligament injury. 
      Additional knowledge about the mode of failure provides a better understanding of 
      the ACLC, allowing for new information for the purpose of AC ligament 
      reconstruction.

TI  - Open Trillat Procedure for Recurrent Anterior Instability of the Shoulder in 
      Elderly Patients.
PG  - e1211-e1216
LID - 10.1016/j.eats.2021.01.021 [doi]
AB  - Among the many different procedures available in the treatment of shoulder 
      instability, the Trillat procedure remains indicated in case of recurrent 
      shoulder instability in elderly patient with an irreparable cuff tear or in case 
      of hyperlaxity. Despite the constantly increasing number of arthroscopic assisted 
      techniques, the open procedure remains a simple, reliable and fast surgical 
      procedure with a shorter learning curve than the arthroscopic techniques. It 
      consists in a partial osteotomy of the anterior cortical of the coracoid process 
      which is then tilted and fixed with a screw into the anterior part of the scapula 
      downwards and medially to obtain a re-centering effect due to the conjoint tendon 
      on the humeral head when rotational movement are applied. This article aims to 
      present a stepwise approach for the open surgical technique.

TI  - Functional outcomes of internal fixation of scapula fractures due to 
      high-velocity gunshot injuries.
LID - 10.1007/s00068-021-01614-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Open fractures of the scapula are relatively rare and only a few 
      studies are interested in this subject. This study aims to demonstrate the 
      results of internal fixation of open scapula fractures due to gunshot injuries. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight patients who had open scapula fractures and were 
      treated by internal fixation through the conventional Judet approach included in 
      this study. Patients were followed up monthly in the first 6 months and every 2 
      months in the rest of the follow-up. Shoulder range of motion, Constant Shoulder 
      Score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score were used for 
      functional evaluation. RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 
      34.6 ± 11.9 months. The average time between injuries and the surgery was 
      10.5 ± 5.1 days. The average shoulder abduction of the patients was 
      135.6 ± 18.8°, the average forward flexion of the shoulder was 160 ± 19.2°. The 
      average internal and external rotations of the shoulders were 80 ± 14.1° and 
      63.1 ± 17.3°, respectively. CSS was calculated as 79.8 ± 14.4, and DASH was 
      calculated as 14.1 ± 14.9. CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of open scapula 
      fractures due to gunshot injuries, an internal fixation is a reliable option and 
      the results were comparable with previous studies.

TI  - Shoulder biomechanics of RC repair and Instability: A systematic review of 
      cadaveric methodology.
PG  - 280-290
LID - S0021-9290(18)30836-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2018.11.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous biomechanical studies have addressed normal shoulder 
      function and the factors that affect it. While these investigations include a mix 
      of in-vivo clinical reports, ex-vivo cadaveric studies, and computer-based 
      simulations, each has its own strengths and limitations. A robust methodology is 
      essential in cadaveric work but does not always come easily. Precise quantitative 
      measurements are difficult in in-vivo studies, and simulation studies require 
      validation steps. This review focuses on ex-vivo cadaveric studies to emphasize 
      the best research methodologies available to simulate physiologically and 
      clinically relevant shoulder motion. METHODS: A PubMed and Web of Science search 
      was conducted in March 2017 (and updated in May 2018) to identify the cadaveric 
      studies focused on the shoulder and its function. The key words for this search 
      included rotator cuff (RC) injuries, RC surgery, and their synonyms. The protocol 
      of the study was registered on PROSPERO and is accessible at CRD42017068873. 
      RESULTS: Thirty one studies consisting of 167 specimens with various 
      biomechanical methods met our inclusion criteria. All studies were level V 
      cadaveric studies. Cadaveric biomechanical models are widely used to study 
      shoulder instability and RC repair. These models are commonly limited to the 
      glenohumeral joint by a fixed scapula, passively and discretely move the humerus, 
      and statically load the RC without regard for the integrity of the glenohumeral 
      capsule. CONCLUSION: All studies captured in this review evaluated shoulder 
      biomechanics. Recent studies in patients suggest that some assumptions made in 
      this space may not fully characterize motion of the human shoulder. With 
      reproducible scapular positioning, dynamic RC activation, and preservation of 
      glenohumeral capsule integrity, cadaveric studies can facilitate proper 
      validation for simulation models and broaden our understanding of the shoulder 
      environment during motion in healthy and disease states.

TI  - Experimental scoliosis in the rat. I. Methodology, anatomic features and 
      neurologic characterization.
PG  - 466-71
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a simple and reproducible model of 
      scoliosis in the rat without producing direct trauma to the spine, in order to 
      both provide a system for the study of human scoliosis and to ultimately study 
      the conditions under which distraction-induced trauma might occur. Right lateral 
      curvatures were produced in three groups of rats (N = 36, 59, 25) at 18-21 days 
      of age by suturing the inferior angle of the scapula to the ipsilateral bony 
      pelvis. In the first group of animals, it was found that a minimum period of 6 
      weeks of tethering was required in order to produce permanent structural 
      curvatures after release of the tethering sutures. In the second group of rats, a 
      number of morphologic and histologic changes characteristic of human scoliosis 
      were noted, including apical wedging, deviation of the apical spinous process, 
      pelvic asymmetry, rib hump deformity, vertebral rotation, displacement of the 
      nucleus pulposus, disorganized columnization of disc cartilage cells, and an 
      increased number of Type I muscle fibers in paravertebral muscle on the convex 
      side of the curve. Finally, in the third group of rats, a mild spasticity was 
      seen in the ipsilateral hindlimb in approximately one-third of the animals with 
      curvatures greater than 40 degrees. This spasticity was not associated with a 
      change of latency or amplitude of the somatosensory-evoked potential (SSEP). Each 
      curvature group displayed SSEP characteristics that were not statistically 
      different from unoperated control animals. These results indicate the validity of 
      this model system for the study of scoliosis, and, in particular, its usefulness 
      for the study of operative-induced trauma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Grammont versus lateralizing reverse shoulder arthroplasty for proximal humerus 
      fracture: functional and radiographic outcomes.
PG  - 57-65
LID - 10.1007/s12306-018-0565-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to retrospectively compare clinical and 
      radiographic outcomes of patients treated with non-lateralizing reverse shoulder 
      arthroplasty (RSA) and with humeral lateralizing RSA after proximal humerus 
      fracture (PHF). METHODS: In total, 32 patients (8 men and 24 women), with a mean 
      age of 77.4 (67-92), have been reevaluated (follow-up of 14.3 months) and divided 
      into Grammont group (G-group-16 patients, 2 men and 14 women, mean age 82.3) and 
      lateralizing group (L-group-16 patients, 4 men and 12 women, mean age 72.5). The 
      dominant side was affected in 21 patients. Pain, Constant-Murley score (CMS), 
      range of motion accurately measured with inertial sensors (SHoWlder, NCSLab(®)) 
      and complications. Anatomic tuberosity healing, signs of loosening or 
      mobilization of the implants and scapular notching (according to Sirveaux 
      classification) have been measured on standard X-ray series (antero-posterior 
      view in neutral, external and internal rotation; axillary view; outlet view). 
      RESULTS: Similar CMS was recorded between the two groups (G-group: 61/100; 
      L-group: 64/100). G-group had higher forward flexion (128° vs. 112°) and 
      abduction (126° vs. 114°), L-group had higher external rotation in abduction (35° 
      vs. 41°); similar internal rotation (sacrum) and rotation with elbow in adduction 
      were measured (12° vs. 19°). No statistically significant differences emerged. 
      Anatomic healing of the tuberosity was higher in G-group (87.5% vs. 50%); 
      low-grade scapular notching was higher in L-group (18.25% grade 1-2 vs. 0). 
      Anatomic healed tuberosity guaranteed highly statistically significant improved 
      functional outcomes. No revisions of the implant were performed. CONCLUSIONS: RSA 
      can be considered a valid solution for the treatment of PHF in elderly 
      low-demanding population. Cuff conditions should be investigated before surgery 
      for the indication of the adequate model.

TI  - Biomechanical analysis of brachial plexus injury: Availability of 
      three-dimensional finite element model of the brachial plexus.
PG  - 1989-1993
LID - 10.3892/etm.2017.5607 [doi]
AB  - Adult brachial plexus injuries frequently lead to significant and permanent 
      physical disabilities. Investigating the mechanism of the injury using 
      biomechanical approaches may lead to further knowledge with regard to preventing 
      brachial plexus injuries. However, there are no reports of biomechanical studies 
      of brachial plexus injuries till date. Therefore, the present study used a 
      complex three-dimensional finite element model (3D-FEM) of the brachial plexus to 
      analyze the mechanism of brachial plexus injury and to assess the validity of the 
      model. A complex 3D-FEM of the spinal column, dura mater, spinal nerve root, 
      brachial plexus, rib bone and cartilage, clavicle, scapula, and humerus were 
      conducted. Stress was applied to the model based on the mechanisms of clinically 
      reported brachial plexus injuries: Retroflexion of the cervical, lateroflexion of 
      the cervical, rotation of the cervical, and abduction of the upper limb. The 
      present study analyzed the distribution and strength of strain applied to the 
      brachial plexus during each motion. When the cervical was retroflexed or 
      lateroflexed, the strain was focused on the C5 nerve root and the upper trunk of 
      the brachial plexus. When the upper limb was abducted, strain was focused on the 
      C7 and C8 nerve roots and the lower trunk of the brachial plexus. The results of 
      brachial plexus injury mechanism corresponded with clinical findings that 
      demonstrated the validity of this model. The results of the present study 
      hypothesized that the model has a future potential for analyzing pathological 
      conditions of brachial plexus injuries and other injuries or diseases, including 
      that of spine and spinal nerve root.

AB  - The shoulder is at high risk for injury during overhead sports, in particular in 
      throwing or hitting activities, such as baseball, tennis, handball, and 
      volleyball. In order to create a scientific basis for the prevention of recurrent 
      injuries in overhead athletes, four steps need to be undertaken: (1) risk factors 
      for injury and re-injury need to be defined; (2) established risk factors may be 
      used as return-to-play criteria, with cut-off values based on normative 
      databases; (3) these variables need to be measured using reliable, valid 
      assessment tools and procedures; and (4) preventative training programs need to 
      be designed and implemented into the training program of the athlete in order to 
      prevent re-injury. In general, three risk factors have been defined that may form 
      the basis for recommendations for the prevention of recurrent injury and return 
      to play after injury: glenohumeral internal-rotation deficit (GIRD); rotator cuff 
      strength, in particular the strength of the external rotators; and scapular 
      dyskinesis, in particular scapular position and strength.

TI  - Stable glenoid component of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty at 2 years as 
      measured with model-based radiostereometric analysis (RSA).
PG  - 644-650
LID - 10.1080/17453674.2021.1943932 [doi]
AB  - Background and purpose - Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is used for 
      treating cuff arthropathy, displaced proximal humeral fractures (PHF), and in 
      revision shoulder surgery, despite sparse evidence on long-term results. We 
      assessed stability of the glenoid component in reverse TSA, using model-based 
      RSA.Patients and methods - 20 patients (mean age 76 years, 17 female), operated 
      on with reverse TSA at Oslo University Hospital, in 2015-2017 were included. 
      Indications for surgeries were PHFs, malunion, cuff arthropathy, and chronic 
      shoulder dislocation. RSA markers were placed in the scapular neck, the coracoid, 
      and the acromion. RSA radiographs were conducted postoperatively, at 3 months, 1 
      year, and 2 years. RSA analysis was performed using RSAcore with Reversed 
      Engineering (RE) modality, with clinical precision < 0.25 mm for all translations 
      (x, y, z) and < 0.7° for rotations (x, z). Scapular "notching" was assessed in 
      conventional radiographs.Results - 1 patient was excluded due to revision 
      surgery. More than half of the patients displayed measurable migration at 2 
      years: 6 patients with linear translations below 1 mm and 8 patients who showed 
      rotational migration. Except for one outlier, the measured rotations were below 
      2°. The migration pattern suggested implant stability at 2 years. 10 patients 
      showed radiolographic signs of "notching", and the mean Oxford Shoulder Score 
      (OSS) at 2 years was 29 points (15-36 points).Interpretation - Stability analysis 
      of the glenoid component of reversed total shoulder arthroplasty using reversed 
      engineering (RE) model-based RSA indicated component stability at 2 years.

TI  - The effect of screw position on the initial fixation of a reverse total shoulder 
      prosthesis in a glenoid with a cavitary bone defect.
PG  - 479-86
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2007.09.002 [doi]
AB  - Patients with rotator cuff tear arthropathy can be treated successfully with a 
      reverse total shoulder prosthesis. In patients with significant glenoid bone 
      loss, achieving stable bone fixation can be challenging, as the surgeon must know 
      when bone grafting is necessary and when the plan to implant the reverse total 
      shoulder prosthesis should be abandoned because of the likelihood of early 
      implant loosening. The purposes of this study were (1) to determine the initial 
      stability of a metal glenoid implant fixed in a glenoid with a central cavitary 
      defect and (2) to determine whether an altered screw configuration would 
      sufficiently resist implant micromotion and, thereby, allow bone ingrowth to 
      occur. The Delta III reverse total shoulder glenoid implant was fixed into foam 
      scapulae with a uniform density similar to normal glenoid bone density. The 
      control group implants were fixed into foam scapulae without a glenoid defect, by 
      use of the standard surgical technique for screw placement. The second group was 
      fixed into foam scapulae containing a central cavitary glenoid defect, by use of 
      the standard surgical technique for screw placement. The central cavitary defect 
      was meant to simulate the bone loss typically found after the removal of a loose 
      pegged glenoid implant, and it was created with a 4-pegged glenoid drill guide. A 
      third group was fixed into foam scapula with a central cavitary glenoid defect, 
      with an experimental screw configuration by use of a posterior screw directed 
      toward the spine of the scapula and an anterior screw directed inferior to the 
      central peg. All specimens were loaded with 500 cycles of 1 body weight (70 kg) 
      to simulate the forces generated during arm elevation that occur during the first 
      3 months after surgery. Micromotion between the implant and the foam bone was 
      measured with a digital video motion analysis system (accuracy, +/- 2.6 microm). 
      After loading of the implant with 70 kg for 500 cycles in the superior direction, 
      the mean micromotion was 54 microm (SD, 22) in the control group, 159 microm (SD, 
      70) in the second group, and 86 microm (SD, 32) in the third group (P = 0.003). 
      Fixing the posterior screw into the spine of the scapula and directing the 
      anterior screw below the central peg decreased the micromotion of a metal glenoid 
      implant fixed in a glenoid with a cavitary defect by 46% and, more importantly, 
      reduced the micromotion below the critical threshold of 150 microm, which is 
      necessary for bone ingrowth and long-term survival of the implant.

TI  - The Evolution of Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty-From the First Steps to 
      Novel Implant Designs and Surgical Techniques.
LID - 10.3390/jcm11061512 [doi]
LID - 1512
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize recent literature 
      regarding the latest design modifications and biomechanical evolutions of reverse 
      total shoulder arthroplasty and their impact on postoperative outcomes. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Over the past decade, worldwide implantation rates of reverse total 
      shoulder arthroplasty have drastically increased for various shoulder 
      pathologies. While Paul Grammont's design principles first published in 1985 for 
      reverse total shoulder arthroplasty remained unchanged, several adjustments were 
      made to address postoperative clinical and biomechanical challenges such as 
      implant glenoid loosening, scapular notching, or limited range of motion in order 
      to maximize functional outcomes and increase the longevity of reverse total 
      shoulder arthroplasty. However, the adequate and stable fixation of prosthetic 
      components can be challenging, especially in massive osteoarthritis with 
      concomitant bone loss. To overcome such issues, surgical navigation and 
      patient-specific instruments may be a viable tool to improve accurate prosthetic 
      component positioning. Nevertheless, larger clinical series on the accuracy and 
      possible complications of this novel technique are still missing.

AB  - Accelerometry is a recent method used to quantify workload in team sports. A 
      rapidly increasing number of studies supports the practical implementation of 
      accelerometry monitoring to regulate and optimize training schemes. Therefore, 
      the purposes of this study were: (1) to reflect the current state of knowledge 
      about accelerometry as a method of workload monitoring in invasion team sports 
      according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and (2) to conclude recommendations for 
      application and scientific investigations. The Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus 
      databases were searched for relevant published studies according to the following 
      keywords: "accelerometry" or "accelerometer" or "microtechnology" or "inertial 
      devices", and "load" or "workload", and "sport". Of the 1383 studies initially 
      identified, 118 were selected for a full review. The main results indicate that 
      the most frequent findings were (i) devices' body location: scapulae; (b) devices 
      brand: Catapult Sports; (iii) variables: PlayerLoadTM and its variations; (iv) 
      sports: rugby, Australian football, soccer and basketball; (v) sex: male; (vi) 
      competition level: professional and elite; and (vii) context: separate training 
      or competition. A great number of variables and devices from various companies 
      make the comparability between findings difficult; unification is required. 
      Although the most common location is at scapulae because of its optimal signal 
      reception for time-motion analysis, new methods for multi-location skills and 
      locomotion assessment without losing tracking accuracy should be developed.

TI  - Effect of Climate Change on Lyme Disease Risk in North America.
PG  - 38-46
AB  - An understanding of the influence of climate change on Ixodes scapularis, the 
      main vector of Lyme disease in North America, is a fundamental component in 
      assessing changes in the spatial distribution of human risk for the disease. We 
      used a climate suitability model of I. scapularis to examine the potential 
      effects of global climate change on future Lyme disease risk in North America. A 
      climate-based logistic model was first used to explain the current distribution 
      of I. scapularis in North America. Climate change scenarios were then applied to 
      extrapolate the model in time and produce forecasts of vector establishment. The 
      spatially modeled relationship between I. scapularis presence and large-scale 
      environmental data generated the current pattern of I. scapularis across North 
      America with an accuracy of 89% (p<0.0001). Extrapolation of the model revealed a 
      significant expansion of I. scapularis north into Canada with an increase in 
      suitable habitat of 213% by the 2080's. Climate change will also result in a 
      retraction of the vector from southern United States, and movement into the 
      central United States. This report predicts the effect of climate change on Lyme 
      disease risk and specifically forecasts the emergence of a tick-borne infectious 
      disease in Canada. Our modeling approach could thus be used to outline where 
      future control strategies and prevention efforts need to be applied.

TI  - Arthroscopic management of recurrent anterior dislocation of the shoulder: 
      analysis of technical modifications on the Caspari procedure.
PG  - 144-9
AB  - Arthroscopic treatment was performed on 71 patients with recurrent shoulder 
      dislocations; all of the patients had monoplanar anterior instability 
      attributable to arthroscopically diagnosed Bankart lesion. Of the 71 operations, 
      29 were performed using the original Caspari technique (follow-up, 59 months), 
      and 42 were performed after modifications made in the original technique 
      (follow-up, 38 months), notably improved preparation of the capsular reinsertion 
      zone and increase in the number of monofilament points and their anchorage 
      directly to the bone, on the spine of the scapula. We compared the results 
      obtained in these two differently treated groups, taking into account several 
      factors in the patient's history and clinical condition. These included the 
      number of dislocation episodes before the operation, as well as clinical findings 
      regarding stability, movement, function and pain (Rowe scale score), 
      contralateral shoulder laxity, level of preoperative versus postoperative 
      athletic activity, and postoperative recurrence rate. In the Caspari-treated 
      group, we obtained 66% satisfactory results compared with the 90% obtained in the 
      second group. The recurrence rate was 27% in the first group compared with 4.8% 
      in the second group. These data were statistically significant. No correlation 
      was found between preoperative number of dislocations and recurrence rate, nor 
      for contralateral shoulder laxity. No significant difference was found regarding 
      resumption of sport activity in the two groups. Our data indicate that, with 
      accuracy in patient selection and effective surgical technique, the recurrence 
      rate can be reduced, and results similar to those of the arthrotomic technique 
      may be obtained.

AB  - Proper placement of suture anchors is an important step in Bankart repair as 
      improper placement can lead to failure. Concern surrounding suture anchor 
      placement inspired the use navigation systems in shoulder arthroscopy. We aimed 
      to demonstrate the technological advantage of using the O-arm (Medtronic 
      Navigation, Denver, CO, USA) image guidance system to provide real-time images 
      during portal and anchor placements in shoulder arthroscopy. Consecutive patients 
      (from July to October 2014) who were admitted for arthroscopic capsulolabral 
      repair surgeries were included. Ten patients were randomly enrolled in the 
      navigation group and 10 in the traditional group. The glenoid was divided into 
      four zones, and the penetration rates in each zone were compared between the two 
      groups. In zone III, the most inferior region of the glenoid, the penetration 
      rate was 40.9% in the traditional group and 15.7% in the navigation group (P = 
      0.077), demonstrating a trend toward improved accuracy of anchor placement with 
      the aid of the navigation system; however, this was not statistically 
      significant. Average surgical time in the navigation and traditional groups was 
      177.6±40.2 and 117.7±17.6 mins, respectively. American Shoulder and Elbow 
      Surgeons Shoulder Scores showed no difference before and 6 months after surgery. 
      This pilot study showed a trend toward decreased penetration rate in 
      O-arm-navigated capsulolabral repair surgeries and decreased risks of implant 
      misplacement; however, possibly due to the small sample size, the difference was 
      not statistically significant. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm 
      the possible benefit of the navigation system. Even with the use of navigation 
      systems, there were still some penetrations in zone III of the glenoid. This 
      penetration may be attributed to the micro-motion of the acromioclavicular joint. 
      Although the navigation group showed a significant increase in surgical time, 
      with improvements in instrument design, O-arm-navigated arthroscopy will gain 
      popularity in clinical practice.

TI  - Computed tomography of the shoulders in patients with obstetric brachial plexus 
      injuries: a retrospective study.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.1186/1750-1164-2-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scapular hypoplasia, elevation, and rotation (SHEAR) deformity and 
      posterior subluxation of the humeral head are common tertiary sequelae of 
      obstetric brachial plexus injuries (OBPI). Interpretations of images from 
      bilateral computed tomography (CT) scans of the upper extremities are critical to 
      the diagnosis and treatment plan for patients with these bony deformities 
      resulting from OBPI. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to investigate 
      the accuracy of radiologic reports in the diagnosis of SHEAR or posterior 
      subluxation of the humeral head in OBPI patients. CT studies from 43 consecutive 
      patients over a 33-month period were used in the study. For each patient, we 
      compared the results from the radiologic report to those from a clinical 
      examination given by the attending surgeon and to measurements taken from the CT 
      studies by biomedical researchers. RESULTS: A comparison of SHEAR measured from 
      the 3-D CT images to the diagnoses from the radiologists, revealed that only 40% 
      of the radiological reports were accurate. However, there was a direct 
      correlation between the use of the 3-D CT images and an accurate SHEAR diagnosis 
      by the radiologists (p < 0.0001). When posterior subluxation was measured in the 
      affected and contralateral shoulders, 93% of the patients that had greater than a 
      10% difference between the two shoulders did not have their deformity diagnosed. 
      The radiological reports diagnosed 17% of these patients with a 'normal' 
      shoulder. Only 5% of the reports were complete, accurately diagnosing SHEAR in 
      addition to posterior subluxation. CONCLUSION: Due to the low incidence rate of 
      OBPI, many radiologists may be unfamiliar with the sequelae of these injuries. It 
      is therefore critical that radiologists are made aware of the importance of an 
      accurate measurement and diagnosis of the SHEAR deformity. Due to their lack of 
      completeness, the radiological reports in this study did not significantly 
      contribute to the clinical care of the patients. In order for OBPI patients to 
      receive the highest standard of care, the final diagnosis from their radiological 
      imaging should be deferred to a brachial plexus specialist who is experienced 
      with these types of injuries.

TI  - Negligible Correlation between Radiographic Measurements and Clinical Outcomes in 
      Patients Following Primary Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty.
LID - 10.3390/jcm10040809 [doi]
LID - 809
AB  - Previous attempts to measure lateralization, distalization or inclination after 
      reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) and to correlate them with clinical 
      outcomes have been made in the past years. However, this is considered to be too 
      demanding and challenging for daily clinical practice. Additionally, the reported 
      findings were obtained from heterogeneous rTSA cohorts using 145° and 155° 
      designs and are limited in external validity. The purpose of this study was to 
      investigate the prognostic preoperative and postoperative radiographic factors 
      affecting clinical outcomes in patients following rTSA using a 135° prosthesis 
      design. In a multi-center design, patients undergoing primary rTSA using a 135° 
      design were included. Radiographic analysis included center of rotation (COR), 
      acromiohumeral distance (AHD), lateral humeral offset (LHO), distalization 
      shoulder angle (DSA), lateralization shoulder angle (LSA), critical shoulder 
      angle (CSA), and glenoid and baseplate inclination. Radiographic measurements 
      were correlated to clinical and functional outcomes, including the American 
      Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Simple Shoulder Test (STT), Single Assessment 
      Numeric Evaluation (SANE), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, active forward 
      elevation (AFE), external rotation (AER), and abduction (AABD), at a minimum 
      2-year follow-up. There was a significant correlation between both DSA (r = 
      0.299; p = 0.020) and LSA (r = -0.276; p = 0.033) and the degree of AFE at final 
      follow-up. However, no correlation between DSA (r = 0.133; p = 0.317) and LSA (r 
      = -0.096; p = 0.471) and AER was observed. Postoperative AHD demonstrated a 
      significant correlation with final AFE (r = 0.398; p = 0.002) and SST (r = 0.293; 
      p = 0.025). Further, postoperative LHO showed a significant correlation with ASES 
      (r = -0.281; p = 0.030) and LSA showed a significant correlation with ASES (r = 
      -0.327; p = 0.011), SANE (r = -0.308, p = 0.012), SST (r = -0.410; p = 0.001), 
      and VAS (r = 0.272; p = 0.034) at terminal follow-up. All other correlations were 
      found to be non-significant (p > 0.05, respectively). Negligible correlations 
      between pre- and postoperative radiographic measurements and clinical outcomes 
      following primary rTSA using a 135° prosthesis design were demonstrated; however, 
      these observations are of limited predictive value for outcomes following rTSA. 
      Subsequently, there remains a debate regarding the ideal placement of the 
      components during rTSA to most sufficiently restore active ROM while minimizing 
      complications such as component loosening and scapular notching. Additionally, as 
      the data from this study show, there is still a considerable lack of data in 
      assessing radiographic prosthesis positioning in correlation to clinical 
      outcomes. As such, the importance of radiographic measurements and their 
      correlation with clinical and functional outcomes following rTSA may be limited.

TI  - A Cadaveric Study on the Utility of the Levator Scapulae Motor Nerve as a Donor 
      for Brachial Plexus Reconstruction.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the utility of the levator 
      scapulae motor nerve (LSN) as a donor nerve for brachial plexus nerve transfer. 
      We hypothesized that the LSN could be transferred to the suprascapular nerve 
      (SSN) or long thoracic nerve (LTN) with a reliable tension-free coaptation and 
      appropriate donor-to-recipient axon count ratio. METHODS: Twelve brachial plexus 
      dissections were performed on 6 adult cadavers, bilaterally. We identified the 
      LSN, spinal accessory nerve (SAN), SSN, and LTN. Each nerve was prepared for 
      transfer and nerve redundancies were calculated. Cross-sections of each nerve 
      were examined histologically, and axons counted. We transferred the LSN to target 
      first the SSN and then the LTN, in a tension-free coaptation. For reference, we 
      transferred the distal SAN to target the SSN and LTN and compared transfer 
      parameters. RESULTS: Three cadavers demonstrated 2 LSN branches supplying the 
      levator scapulae. The axon count ratio of donor-to-recipient nerve was 1:4.0 
      (LSN:SSN) and 1:2.1 (LSN:LTN) for a single LSN branch and 1:3.0 (LSN:SSN) and 
      1:1.6 (LSN:LTN) when 2 LSN branches were available. Comparatively, the axon count 
      ratio of donor-to-recipient nerve was 1:2.5 and 1:1.3 for the SAN to the SSN and 
      the LTN, respectively. The mean redundancy from the LSN to the SSN and the LTN 
      was 1.7 cm (SD, 3.1 cm) and 2.9 cm (SD, 2.8 cm), and the redundancy from the SAN 
      to the SSN and the LTN was 4.5 (SD, 0.7 cm) and 0.75 cm (SD, 1.0 cm). 
      CONCLUSIONS: These data support the use of the LSN as a potential donor for 
      direct nerve transfer to the SSN and LTN, given its adequate redundancy and size 
      match. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The LSN should be considered as an alternative nerve 
      donor source for brachial plexus reconstruction, especially in 5-level injuries 
      with scarce donor nerves. If used in lieu of the SAN during primary nerve 
      reconstruction, trapezius tendon transfer for improved external rotation would be 
      enabled.

TI  - Variability of glenohumeral positioning and bone-to-tendon marker length 
      measurements in repaired rotator cuffs from longitudinal computed tomographic 
      imaging.
PG  - 838-847
LID - 10.1016/j.jseint.2020.08.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To address the need for more objective and quantitative measures of 
      tendon healing in research studies, we intend to use computed tomography (CT) 
      with implanted radiopaque markers on the repaired tendon to measure tendon 
      retraction following rotator cuff repair. In our small prior study, retraction at 
      1-year follow-up averaged 16.1± 5.3 mm and exceeded 10.0 mm in 12 of 13 patients, 
      and thus tendon retraction appears to be a common clinical phenomenon. This 
      study's objectives were to assess, using 5 longitudinal CT scans obtained over 1 
      year following rotator cuff repair, the variability in glenohumeral positioning 
      because of pragmatic variations in achieving perfect arm repositioning and to 
      estimate the associated measurement variability in bone-to-tendon marker length 
      measurements. METHODS: Forty-eight patients underwent rotator cuff repair with 
      intraoperative placement of radiopaque tendon markers at the repair site. All 
      patients had a CT scan with their arms at the side on the day of surgery and at 
      3, 12, 26, and 52 weeks postoperatively. Glenohumeral position (defined by the 
      orientation and distance of the humerus with respect to the scapula) and 
      bone-to-tendon marker lengths were measured from each scan. Within-patient 
      variation in glenohumeral position measurements was described by their pooled 
      within-patient standard deviations (SDs), and variation in bone-to-tendon marker 
      lengths by their standard errors of measurement (SEMs) and 95% confidence level 
      minimally detectable distances (MDD(95)) and changes (MDC(95)). RESULTS: The mean 
      glenohumeral orientation from the 5 longitudinal CT scans averaged across the 48 
      patients was 12.6° abduction, 0.4° flexion, and -0.1° internal rotation. 
      Within-patient SDs (95% confidence intervals) of glenohumeral orientation were 
      3.0° (2.7°-3.4°) in extension/flexion, 5.2° (4.6°-5.8°) in abduction/adduction, 
      and 8.2° (7.3°-9.2°) in internal/external rotation. The SDs of glenohumeral 
      distances were less than 1 mm in any direction. The estimated SEMs of 
      bone-to-tendon lengths were consistent with a common value of 2.4 mm for any of 
      the tendon markers placed across the repair, with MDD(95) of 4.7 mm and MDC(95) 
      of 6.7 mm. CONCLUSION: Apparent tendon retraction of 5 mm or more, when measured 
      as the distance from a tendon marker's day of surgery location to its new 
      location on a volumetrically registered longitudinal CT scan, may be considered 
      above the usual range of measurement variation. Tendon retraction measured using 
      implanted radiopaque tendon markers offers an objective and sufficiently reliable 
      means for quantifying the commonly expected changes in structural healing 
      following rotator cuff repair.

      reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.
PG  - 384-389

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Scapular notching is a unique radiographic sequela of reverse total 
      shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) with unclear long-term clinical consequences. 
      METHODS: Our retrospective review of a single surgeon, single implant, primary 
      rTSA database investigates the incidence of scapular notching at 2 and 5-year 
      follow-up. Various patient outcome scores were also obtained. RESULTS: Of 158 
      primary rTSAs performed, 82 (52%) patients completed 2-year and subsequent 5-year 
      follow-up. The incidence of scapular notching at 2 and 5-years was 11.9% and 
      19.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Scapular notching negatively affects validated 
      post-operative outcome scores, active range of motion and total complications, 
      and furthermore increases with time.

TI  - The Personalized Shoulder Reconstruction Assisted by 3D Printing Technology After 
      Resection of the Proximal Humerus Tumours.
PG  - 10665-10673
LID - 10.2147/CMAR.S232051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) may be a promising 
      alternative for proximal humerus tumours because of good postoperative shoulder 
      function. However, the conventional reverse shoulder prosthesis can not meet 
      individual needs and RSA has been associated with a relatively high complication 
      rate. Therefore, implant design and surgical reconstruction technique warrant 
      further study. METHODS: Between September 2015 and May 2018, 7 patients were 
      treated via RSA after en-bloc resection of the proximal humerus tumours. A 
      3D-printed guiding baseplate was used to assist the implant of the 3D-printed 
      glenoid prosthesis; a personalized humerus prosthesis was used to reconstruct the 
      proximal humerus. The functional outcomes were assessed by range of motion (ROM) 
      of the shoulder joint, Musculoskeletal Tumour Society (MSTS) functional score, 
      and Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS). We also analyzed tumour recurrence, 
      metastases, and complications associated with the reconstruction procedure. 
      RESULTS: All patients were observed for 14 to 36 months, with an average of 23.6 
      months. At the final follow-up, the mean MSTS score was 85.7% (range, 
      73.3-93.3%), and the mean TESS score was 90.0% (range, 84.1-95.9%). No 
      instability, infection, scapular notching, loosening or fracture were observed in 
      this series. One patient with GCT suffered from pulmonary metastasis, while one 
      with osteosarcoma died because of pulmonary metastasis. CONCLUSION: The 
      3D-printed guiding baseplate facilitated the accurate implantation of the glenoid 
      prosthesis. The RSA based on a 3D-printed glenoid prosthesis and a personalized 
      custom-made humerus prosthesis significantly improved the shoulder function and 
      decreased the complication rate. Further studies of a larger scale with longer 
      follow-up are required to validate this technology.

TI  - De novo RNA-seq and functional annotation of Ornithonyssus bacoti.
PG  - 191-208
LID - 10.1007/s10493-018-0264-9 [doi]
AB  - Ornithonyssus bacoti (Hirst) (Acari: Macronyssidae) is a vector and reservoir of 
      pathogens causing serious infectious diseases, such as epidemic hemorrhagic 
      fever, endemic typhus, tularemia, and leptospirosis. Its genome and transcriptome 
      data are lacking in public databases. In this study, total RNA was extracted from 
      live O. bacoti to conduct RNA-seq, functional annotation, coding domain sequence 
      (CDS) prediction and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) detection. The results showed 
      that 65.8 million clean reads were generated and assembled into 72,185 unigenes, 
      of which 49.4% were annotated by seven functional databases. 23,121 unigenes were 
      annotated and assigned to 457 species by non-redundant protein sequence database. 
      The BLAST top-two hit species were Metaseiulus occidentalis and Ixodes 
      scapularis. The procedure detected 12,426 SSRs, of which tri- and di-nucleotides 
      were the most abundant types and the representative motifs were AAT/ATT and 
      AC/GT. 26,936 CDS were predicted with a mean length of 711 bp. 87 unigenes of 30 
      functional genes, which are usually involved in stress responses, drug 
      resistance, movement, metabolism and allergy, were further identified by 
      bioinformatics methods. The unigenes putatively encoding cytochrome P450 proteins 
      were further analyzed phylogenetically. In conclusion, this study completed the 
      RNA-seq and functional annotation of O. bacoti successfully, which provides 
      reliable molecular data for its future studies of gene function and molecular 
      markers.

TI  - Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Systematic 
      Review.
PG  - 325-331
LID - 10.4055/cios.2017.9.3.325 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are limited data available regarding the results of reverse 
      shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We 
      performed a systematic review of the literature to investigate the radiological 
      and clinical outcomes after RSA in patients with RA. METHODS: A literature search 
      for publications between 1987 and 2014 was conducted by 2 independent reviewers 
      using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. 
      Articles were retrieved by an electronic search using keywords and their 
      combinations. Studies that met inclusion criteria were assessed for pertinent 
      data. RESULTS: Seven studies including 123 shoulders met the inclusion criteria. 
      The mean age of the patients was 67.9 years and the mean follow-up period was 
      46.6 months. The mean Constant score and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons 
      (ASES) score increased from 18.6 and 27.5 preoperatively to 58.6 and 73.7, 
      respectively, at the final follow-up evaluation. The mean active forward flexion, 
      abduction, and external rotation increased from 57.2°, 50.4°, and 11.4° to 
      127.1°, 116.7°, and 26.4°, respectively. The incidence of scapular notching was 
      33.7%. Twenty-seven (22.0%) of 123 shoulders had one or more complications, 12 of 
      which (44.4%) had intraoperative or postoperative fractures. Nine shoulders 
      (7.3%) had one or more revision surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: RSA in RA showed similar 
      short- to mid-term results without higher complication rates as compared to RSA 
      in cuff tear arthropathy. Although RSA can be considered a reliable treatment 
      option in patients with RA, further large-scale studies are required to determine 
      the long-term survival of the implant.

TI  - Treatment of compound tibial fracture with free osteomuscular latissimus dorsi 
      scapula flap.
PG  - 217-24
LID - 10.1055/s-0034-1395995 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Compound tibial fractures with extensive comminution and soft tissue 
      defects are limb-threatening reconstructive challenges. The purpose of this study 
      was to assess the long-term outcomes and the reliability of the latissimus dorsi 
      scapula flap for this indication. METHODS: The hospital records of 26 compound 
      tibial fracture patients treated with the latissimus dorsi scapula flap were 
      reviewed. An overall assessment was performed in several steps based on a 
      preinformation and two function-related questionnaires together with radiographs, 
      clinical overviews, and functional tests. RESULTS: In 85% of the cases, the 
      fractures had resulted from high-energy trauma and had extensive zone of injury. 
      The mean follow-up time was 6.2 years. Nine patients required reconstruction 
      because of prolonged sequelae after infection, nonunion, or tissue deficiency. 
      One flap loss occurred leading to amputation. Six patients required an additional 
      operation to enhance bony union. Full weight-bearing was allowed in 3 months and 
      the mean time to bony union was 10 months. Overall, 90% returned to their 
      pretrauma occupation. Overall 11 patients were lost to follow-up. A total of 14 
      patients answered the questionnaires whereas 12 outpatients attended the clinical 
      assessment. The main finding after evaluating the results of the functional tests 
      and reviewing the questionnaires was the limitation in ankle movement while the 
      donor site performed well. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that osteomuscular 
      latissimus dorsi scapula flap reconstruction is a suitable alternative for 
      compound and comminuted tibia fractures especially in the case of extensive soft 
      tissue injury with bony loss or significant comminution and with high probability 
      of amputation.

TI  - "8 plate": an alternative device to fix highly recurrent traumatic anterior 
      gleno-humeral instability in patients with severe impairment of the anterior 
      capsule.
PG  - 457-61
LID - 10.2174/1874325001408010457 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is still debate about the best treatment option for highly 
      recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation in patients with severe impairment of the 
      anterior capsule and/or recurrence after either arthroscopic or open 
      capsulorrhaphy. Materials and. METHODS: The clinical and radiological findings of 
      7 patients treated with an open capsulorrhaphy stabilized with an "8 plate" for a 
      highly recurrent traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation with severe impairment 
      of the anterior capsule and a large Bankart lesion were retrospectively reviewed. 
      Follow-up evaluation included VAS for pain, Constant-Murley, Simple Shoulder 
      Test, ASES, UCLA, Quick DASH, Rowe, Walsch-Duplay scores, as well as X-rays of 
      the operated shoulder. RESULTS: At follow-up none of the patients reported 
      subsequent dislocations. Range of motion of the shoulder was complete in all 
      cases, but one. Results of the functional scoring systems were satisfactory. 
      X-rays showed no osteolysis and good position of the plate. CONCLUSION: To our 
      knowledge, this is the first report in the literature about an open capsular 
      tensioning and Bankart lesion repair performed with an "8 plate". We believe that 
      this is a reliable and effective procedure to address traumatic anterior 
      re-dislocation of the gleno-humeral joint when the capsule is extensively torn 
      and frayed or in revision cases. Moreover the "8 plate" is ideal to be applied in 
      such a narrow space on the slant surface of the scapular neck close to the 
      glenoid rim.

TI  - Dynamic spatial tuning of cervical muscle reflexes to multidirectional seated 
      perturbations.
PG  - E211-9
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000000721 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Human volunteers were exposed experimentally to multidirectional 
      seated perturbations. OBJECTIVE: To determine the activation patterns, spatial 
      distribution and preferred directions of reflexively activated cervical muscles 
      for human model development and validation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Models of 
      the human head and neck are used to predict occupant kinematics and injuries in 
      motor vehicle collisions. Because of a dearth of relevant experimental data, few 
      models use activation schemes based on in vivo recordings of muscle activation 
      and instead assume uniform activation levels for all muscles within presumed 
      agonist or antagonist groups. Data recorded from individual cervical muscles are 
      needed to validate or refute this assumption. METHODS: Eight subjects (6 males, 2 
      females) were exposed to seated perturbations in 8 directions. Electromyography 
      was measured with wire electrodes inserted into the sternocleidomastoid, 
      trapezius, levator scapulae, splenius capitis, semispinalis capitis, semispinalis 
      cervicis, and multifidus muscles. Surface electrodes were used to measure 
      sternohyoid activity. Muscle activity evoked by the perturbations was normalized 
      with recordings from maximum voluntary contractions. RESULTS: The 
      multidirectional perturbations produced activation patterns that varied with 
      direction within and between muscles. Sternocleidomastoid and sternohyoid 
      activated similarly in forward and forward oblique directions. The semispinalis 
      capitis, semispinalis cervicis, and multifidus exhibited similar spatial patterns 
      and preferred directions, but varied in activation levels. Levator scapulae and 
      trapezius activity generally remained low, and splenius capitis activity varied 
      widely between subjects. CONCLUSION: All muscles showed muscle- and 
      direction-specific contraction levels. Models should implement muscle- and 
      direction-specific activation schemes during simulations of the head and neck 
      responses to omnidirectional horizontal perturbations where muscle forces 
      influence kinematics, such as during emergency maneuvers and low-severity 
      crashes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) provides an alternative for 
      shoulder girdle reconstruction after wide transarticular resection of the 
      proximal humerus for malignant tumor. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
      midterm outcomes of this therapeutic option. METHODS: Ten patients with RSA were 
      included and reviewed with 24 months of minimum follow-up. Proximal resection of 
      malignant tumor included the "V" deltoid insertion in 4 patients. The humeral 
      stem was coated (with an allograft in 2 patients and a cement mantel in 3) or 
      left uncoated (5 patients). RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 42 months, among 8 
      prosthesis available for evaluation (2 patients died), the Constant and Murley 
      score averaged 52 points, the 11-item version of the Disabilities of the Arm, 
      Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) score averaged 29.5 points, the Subjective Shoulder 
      Value averaged 58%, and the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score averaged 20.25 
      points. Mean forward active elevation reached 122°, external rotation at side was 
      -2°, and internal rotation was to L4. Three prostheses were unstable. The 
      involvement of "V" deltoid insertion at surgery trended to worsen the clinical 
      outcome. Atrophy of the anterior deltoid occurred in most of patients who had a 
      previous transdeltoid biopsy. Radiographic evaluation found 1 stem loosening, 1 
      stem at risk, and 3 scapular notches without glenoid loosening. CONCLUSION: Use 
      of RSA after resection of a malignant tumor of the proximal humerus seems to be 
      an acceptable option to preserve function. However, radiographic evolution is 
      worrisome, and long-term study remains necessary to validate this therapeutic 
      option with follow-up.

TI  - Grammont reversed prosthesis for acute complex fracture of the proximal humerus 
      in an elderly population with 5 to 12 years follow-up.

AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze outcome 
      in 23 cases of Delta III reverse ball-and-socket total shoulder prosthesis 
      implantation for acute complex fractures of the proximal humerus in an elderly 
      population with poor bone quality. In this type of population, this procedure 
      could respond to the difficulties of a reliable and efficient re-fixation of the 
      tubercles. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 1993 to 2000, 23 Delta III prostheses were 
      implanted by a single operator for acute injury: 18 three-part and four-part 
      fractures and five fracture-dislocations. The study population included two men 
      and 21 women, mean age 75 years, ten on the dominant side. Surgery was performed 
      under general anesthesia in the semi-sitting position via the anterolateral 
      approach without osteotomy of the acromion, with 10-20° retroversion of the 
      humeral stem (except in one shoulder) and cement fixation in two. For five 
      shoulders, the tubercles were re-fixed. Postoperative physiotherapy was not 
      possible in all patients. Outcome was assessed with the Constant score and with 
      AP and lateral Lamy radiographs. RESULTS: Seven patients died so the series 
      included 16 cases for analysis. Complications were: reflex sympathetic dystrophy 
      (n=2), postoperative Acinetobacter infection (n=1) requiring revision to clean 
      and drain allowing preservation of the prosthesis, and early postoperative 
      anterior dislocation (n=1) (10° stem anteversion) with surgical revision to 
      re-orient the stem. At a mean follow-up of 86 months, the Constant score was 60 
      points (contralateral shoulder, 83 points). Outcome, influenced in cases of 
      re-fixation of the tubercles, was good for pain (14.1), activity (13.3), strength 
      (16.1), anterior elevation (6.5), and abduction (6.5), but very poor for external 
      (1.1) and internal (2.4) rotation. The radiographs showed aseptic glenoid 
      loosening (n=1) at 12 years with surgical revision in 2005; the Constant score at 
      6 months follow-up was 48 points, inferior scapular notching (n=11) according the 
      Nerot classification (six stage 1, four stage 2, one stage 3, at 2, 4.3, and 5 
      years follow-up), inferior spurs (n=9) appearing at a mean 2.5 years follow-up 
      (stable after emergence without clinical impact), proximal humeral resorption 
      (n=4) (medially for three at a mean 8 years follow-up and one laterally at 10 
      years), and a humeral radiolucent line (n=1) at 5 years follow-up. DISCUSSION: 
      For acute complex fractures of the proximal humerus in elderly subjects with poor 
      bone quality, when effective and reliable re-fixation of the tubercles is 
      difficult or impossible, the reverse ball-and-socket shoulder prosthesis is a 
      possible alternative providing good functional outcome except for rotations, but 
      with the risk of inferior scapular notching. Although not problematic in the 
      medium term, these notches may contribute to glenoid loosening with bone loss in 
      the long term. Nevertheless, this procedure seems to improve the status of 
      patients with such fractures.

TI  - Current concepts in shoulder examination of the overhead athlete.
PG  - 554-78
AB  - Examination of the shoulder complex has long been described as challenging. This 
      is particularly true in the examination of the overhead athlete who has 
      structural differences when compared to a shoulder patient who is a non-athlete. 
      Complexity with the examination is due to unique biomechanical and structural 
      changes, multiple joint articulations, multiple pain patterns, and the potential 
      of injury to structures both inside (intra-articular) and outside 
      (extra-articular) the glenohumeral joint. Repetitive stresses placed on the 
      shoulders of overhead athletes may affect range of motion, strength, scapular 
      position, and ultimately, the integrity of soft tissue and bony structures in any 
      of the joints that comprise the shoulder complex. Furthermore, many shoulder 
      examination tests thought to be unique to a single structure, joint, or condition 
      can be positive in multiple conditions. The examination of the overhead athletes 
      shoulder, coupled with a thorough medical history will provide a solid foundation 
      to allow a functional physical therapy diagnosis and provide clues as to the 
      presence of the lesion (s) causing disability. The purpose of this clinical 
      commentary is to assist the reader to understand the unique physical 
      characteristics of the overhead athlete, which will lead to a more accurate and 
      reproducible evaluation of athletes who sustain injuries while participating in 
      overhead sports. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.

TI  - Reconstruction of the head and neck region using lower trapezius musculocutaneous 
      flaps.
PG  - 626-30
LID - 10.5999/aps.2012.39.6.626 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent literature has indicated that free flaps are currently 
      considered the preferred choice for head and neck reconstruction. However, head 
      and neck cancer patients are frequently treated with chemoradiotherapy, which is 
      often associated with a poor general and local condition, and thus, such patients 
      are ineligible for free flap reconstruction. Therefore, other reconstruction 
      modalities should be considered. METHODS: We used lower trapezius 
      musculocutaneous (LTMC) flap based on the dorsal scapular artery to reconstruct 
      head and neck defects that arose from head and neck cancer in 8 patients. All of 
      the patients had undergone preoperative chemoradiotherapy. RESULTS: There were no 
      complications except one case of partial flap necrosis; it was treated with 
      secondary intention. Healing in the remaining patients was uneventful without 
      hematoma, seroma, or infection. The donor sites were closed primarily. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The LTMC flap is the preferred flap for a simple, reliable, large 
      flap with a wide arc of rotation and minor donor-site morbidity. The authors 
      recommend this versatile island flap as an alternative to microvascular free 
      tissue transfer for the reconstruction of defects in the head and neck region, 
      for patients that have undergone preoperative chemoradiotherapy.

TI  - [Clinical effects of clavicular hook plate for Neer type II fracture of distal 
      clavicle].
PG  - 979-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical effect of clavicular hook plate in treating 
      Neer type II fracture of distal clavicle. METHODS: From March 2004 to April 2006, 
      15 patients suffering from Neer type II fracture of distal clavicle were treated 
      with clavicular hook plate, including 12 males and 3 females with an average age 
      of 39 years (range, 17-69 years). All patients had acute injury, including 
      accident injury (8 cases) and falling injury (7 cases). The results were assessed 
      by the JOA method. RESULTS: The wounds healed by first intention. No early 
      complications were found. All patients were followed up for an average of 16.4 
      months (range, 9-34 months). The mean JOA score was 93.1. The mean pain parameter 
      was 28.0, the fuction was 18.8 and the range of motion was 26.3. The X-ray films 
      showed that bony union was obtained in all patients after 3-6 months, and the 
      mean healing period was 3.9 months. No acromioclavicular subluxation and 
      dislocation occurred. CONCLUSION: The principal advantages of this method are 
      reliable fixation and early rehabilitation. It is necessary to protect rotator 
      cuff and tissues behind acromioclavicular joint and remove the plate as soon as 
      possible after bony union.

TI  - Dynamic shoulder dynamometry: a way to develop delay onset muscle soreness in 
      shoulder muscles.
PG  - 184-8
AB  - A dynamic shoulder dynamometer has been designed to develop a vertical downward 
      force over a measured range of motion, i.e. scapular elevation. The dynamometer 
      is force-controlled to apply a required force within the range of motion. 
      Calibration procedures were performed to assess the reliability of the force and 
      displacement measurements. The system is designed to operate in isometric or 
      eccentric conditions. For eccentric exercise the dynamometer has, for the first 
      time, provided possibilities to elicit delay onset muscle soreness in shoulder 
      muscles. In future, the apparatus will enable investigations of sensory-motor 
      interactions in the shoulder region.

TI  - Suprascapular neuropathy.
PG  - 358-67
AB  - Suprascapular neuropathy is an uncommon cause of shoulder pain and weakness and 
      therefore may be overlooked as an etiologic factor. The suprascapular nerve is 
      vulnerable to compression at the suprascapular notch as well as at the 
      spinoglenoid notch. Other causes of suprascapular neuropathy include traction 
      injury at the level of the transverse scapular ligament or the spinoglenoid 
      ligament and direct trauma to the nerve. Sports involving overhead motion, such 
      as tennis, swimming, and weight lifting, may result in traction injury to the 
      suprascapular nerve, leading to dysfunction. The diagnosis of suprascapular 
      neuropathy is based on clinical findings and abnormal electrodiagnostic test 
      results, after the exclusion of other causes of shoulder pain and weakness. 
      Magnetic resonance imaging may provide an anatomic demonstration of nerve 
      entrapment and muscle atrophy. With this modality, ganglion cysts are recognized 
      with increasing frequency as a source of external compression of the 
      suprascapular nerve. Without evidence of a discrete lesion compressing the nerve, 
      nonoperative treatment should include physical therapy and avoidance of 
      precipitating activities. When nonoperative treatment fails to alleviate symptoms 
      or when a discrete lesion such as a ganglion cyst is present, surgical 
      decompression is warranted. Decompression gives reliable pain relief, but 
      recovery of shoulder function and restoration of atrophied muscle tissue may be 
      incomplete.

TI  - Improving the selective use of plain radiographs in the initial evaluation of 
      shoulder pain.
PG  - 200-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a previous retrospective study, we had found that shoulder 
      radiographs were overused in the initial evaluation of patients presenting to the 
      emergency department with shoulder pain. Our objective was to prospectively 
      define clinical criteria that identify patients who have a low risk of 
      radiographic findings that influence the management of the initial evaluation of 
      shoulder pain in the emergency department. METHODS: All adult patients presenting 
      to the emergency department of a university teaching hospital with shoulder pain 
      were eligible to participate. Patients with deformities, penetrating wounds, 
      referred pain, and those presenting for followup were excluded. Data were 
      recorded prospectively using a standardized form. All radiographs were classified 
      as therapeutically uninformative (TU) except fracture, acromioclavicular joint 
      separation (> or =Grade 3), infection, or malignancy. A classification tree was 
      used for analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred six patients had shoulder radiographs, of 
      which 88% were TU. The model yielded 3 sets of low risk patients with a high 
      percentage of TU radiographs: (1) no fall, no swelling (99% TU: 106 TU, 1 
      radiograph with lytic lesions in a cancer patient); (2) a fall, but no swelling, 
      and no pain at rest (100% TU, n = 18); (3) a fall and pain at rest, but no 
      swelling and normal range of motion (100% TU, n = 10). Not performing radiographs 
      on these low risk patients would have decreased radiograph utilization from 52 to 
      18% of all shoulder patients seen. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that specific 
      clinical criteria are able to identify patients who do not need radiographs as 
      part of the initial management of shoulder pain. Prospective validation of these 
      criteria are needed to confirm that these low risk patients can be safely 
      evaluated without radiographs.

TI  - Controversy in anterior shoulder instability.
PG  - 152-61
AB  - The main areas of controversy in anterior shoulder instability are acute 
      dislocation, recurrent instability, pain and instability in the "throwing 
      athlete", and the role of arthroscopy. Treatment of the acute dislocation 
      involves rest initially, followed by aggressive rehabilitation with protection of 
      the shoulder until strength and motion have returned and pain and apprehension 
      have resolved. Patients with recurrent instability may be seen with a variety of 
      clinical scenarios. The surgical indications, pathology, and two methods of 
      soft-tissue reconstruction are described along with an approach to postoperative 
      rehabilitation. Return to sporting activity may be feasible by three months. The 
      current thinking on the painful shoulder in the "throwing athlete" is outlined. 
      Management must be based on an accurate diagnosis. Strengthening of the rotator 
      cuff and scapular stabilizers is recommended with surgery to correct the 
      pathology in those who fail this program. Arthroscopy is a valid tool in the 
      diagnosis of anterior shoulder instability. The clinical significance of some 
      intraarticular findings has not yet been clarified. Therapeutic use should be 
      undertaken only in experienced hands, appreciating that failure of arthroscopic 
      repair is higher than comparable open surgical techniques. The open approach to 
      anterior stabilization is preferred.

TI  - [Anatomical basis of the transposition of the serratus anterior muscle. Study of 
      40 dissections].
PG  - 45-53
AB  - In order to explore the possibility of serratus anterior muscle (SAM) flap 
      transposition in head-neck and thoracic surgery, we performed an anatomical study 
      including 40 dissections of the muscle's vascular pedicle, the 
      subscapular-thoracodorsal axis, which is a branch of the axillary artery (A. 
      subscapularis A. thoracodorsalis). The SAM is characterized by: its location: 
      extending from the anterior and lateral aspect of the thorax to the medial border 
      of the scapula; its easy surgical access; its constant and reliable 
      vascularization by the thoracodorsal artery, a branch of the subscapular artery; 
      its long arc of rotation allowing the utilization of the SAM flap in head and 
      neck and mediastinal surgery without microvascular anastomoses; its versatility 
      in comparison with other perithoracic muscles. These considerations prompted us 
      to use the SAM in head and neck reconstructive surgery, chest wall surgery, chest 
      wall reconstruction following resection for tumor; breast reconstruction; 
      intrathoracic and mediastinal surgery, reinforcement of high-risk 
      tracheobronchial sutures or anastomoses; management of bronchopleural fistulas 
      and empyema spaces; repair of tracheo esophageal fistulas and tracheal or 
      esophageal defects.

TI  - The Dorsal Scapular Artery Perforator Flap: A Complete Muscle-sparing Technique.

LID - e3933
AB  - Cervical and thoracic spine reconstruction can be a difficult area to provide 
      stable soft tissue coverage. Historically, trapezius myocutaneous flaps and 
      trapezius muscle turnover flaps have proven to be reliable and versatile methods 
      for the reconstruction of these areas. However, sequelae such as restriction of 
      shoulder movement have been reported, as well as unsightly "humpback" contour 
      deformities from turnover flap bulk. The use of the trapezius muscle for coverage 
      has evolved to include descriptions of a trapezius perforator flap to address 
      some of the issues of donor site morbidity, as it is described as a 
      muscle-sparing technique. Although described as "muscle-sparing," these 
      approaches nonetheless involve sacrifice of trapezius muscle overlying the 
      pedicle as that musculature is "deroofed" and divided off the pedicle during 
      dissection. In this article, we present a detailed technical description of our 
      novel technique to the trapezius perforator flap using a dorsal scapular artery 
      flap for spinal reconstruction that is truly, completely muscle-sparing. This 
      technique may prove useful for those patients in which even minimal disruption of 
      trapezius muscle fibers is undesirable.

TI  - Hemiarthroplasty as a salvage treatment for failed reverse total shoulder 
      arthroplasty.
PG  - 1055-1061
LID - 10.1016/j.jseint.2021.07.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The implantation rates of reverse total shoulder arthroplasties 
      (RTSAs) are increasing worldwide, resulting in higher absolute numbers of the 
      associated complications and revision surgeries. This requires the discussion of 
      salvage therapies for failed RTSAs without revision to a new RTSA. Revision to 
      hemiarthroplasty may offer a valid fallback option in certain cases. This study 
      aimed to analyze the incidence, indications, and clinical outcomes, especially 
      the reduction in pain levels compared to a matched control group. METHODS: Our 
      prospectively enrolled patient cohort of RTSA implantations at a tertiary 
      referral center between January 2005 and December 2018 was retrospectively 
      queried for revision to a hemiarthroplasty. For clinical outcome evaluation, a 
      minimum follow-up duration of 2 years after revision to hemiarthroplasty was 
      required. Clinical outcome measures were compared to two matching groups, one 
      with RTSA preserving revision and one without any reintervention. The outcome 
      measures were the absolute and relative Constant-Murley score (aCS and rCS), 
      Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV), range of motion, and pain. RESULTS: A total of 
      21 out of 1237 RTSAs (1.7%) underwent salvage revision to hemiarthroplasty at a 
      mean time of 20 ± 21 months (range, 1-75 months). Of those, 12 were available for 
      a minimum follow-up of 2 years after revision to a hemiarthroplasty. The main 
      indications were glenoid loosening (8/12), scapular spine fracture (2/12), and 
      instability (2/21). Clinical outcome was analyzed at a mean follow-up period of 
      46 ± 26 months (24 months to 123 months) after revision to a hemiarthroplasty. 
      The revision significantly reduced CS pain from 6 ± 4 points to 12 ± 3 points 
      (scale 0 to 15 with 15 as optimum, P < .01). The aCS, rCS, SSV, and range of 
      motion did not improve. Comparison with the RTSA preserving revision group and 
      the RTSA group without reintervention showed significantly worse outcome scores 
      for aCS (33 ± 10 vs. 55 ± 19 vs. 69 ± 12 points), rCS (41 ± 14% vs. 67 ± 20% vs. 
      84 ± 13%), SSV (35 ± 19% vs. 64 ± 20% vs. 81 ± 15%), flexion (53 ± 27° vs. 
      64 ± 20° vs. 128 ± 24°), and abduction (50 ± 23° vs. 109 ± 42° vs. 142 ± 24°). 
      Pain was similar in all groups at the last follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: In a few 
      cases, RTSA retention or revision to another RTSA is impossible. For those 
      patients, conversion to hemiarthroplasty is a valid fallback option to reduce the 
      patient's pain levels and provide low-level function.

TI  - Novel Arthroscopic Tendon Transfers for Posterosuperior Rotator Cuff Tears: 
      Latissimus Dorsi and Lower Trapezius Transfers.
PG  - e12
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.ST.17.00062 [doi]
LID - e12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Massive irreparable rotator cuff tears in both the primary and the 
      revision setting are challenging problems. There remains controversy over the 
      ideal treatment methods for these patients. In the case of an irreparable 
      posterosuperior rotator cuff tear, tendon transfers(1-12) have emerged as a 
      reliable option, with a durable outcome. The most commonly used tendon transfer 
      options are the latissimus dorsi (LD)(1-6)and the lower trapezius (LT)(12). 
      DESCRIPTION: The LD transfer is performed by first harvesting the LT tendon from 
      the humeral shaft. It is critical to release the many adhesions to the muscle 
      belly as well as to separate it from the teres major muscle. The tendon is then 
      transferred intra-articularly, in an interval between the deltoid and the teres 
      minor. The tendon is anchored arthroscopically after preparation of the 
      anterolateral aspect of the tuberosity. The LT transfer is performed by 
      harvesting the LT muscle and tendon off its insertion on the medial aspect of the 
      scapular spine. It should be mobilized to maximize excursion by releasing 
      adhesions. An Achilles tendon allograft is anchored into the anterior aspect of 
      the greater tuberosity arthroscopically. The Achilles tendon is then secured to 
      the LT tendon. ALTERNATIVES: In addition to tendon transfer, options 
      include:Partial or complete attempted repair(13-17).Augmentation or bridging with 
      allografts(18-23).Superior capsular reconstruction(24).Subacromial balloon(25). 
      RATIONALE: There remains a paucity of literature comparing tendon transfers with 
      alternatives. However, when considering a tendon transfer, certain principles are 
      critical in order to achieve an optimal outcome:The recipient and transferred 
      tendons must have similar musculotendinous excursion.The recipient and 
      transferred tendons should have similar lines of pull.One tendon (the 
      transferred) should be designed to replace 1 function (of the recipient).The 
      function of the transferred tendon and muscle should be expendable without 
      substantial donor site morbidity.The strength of the transferred muscle must be 
      at least grade 4.When deciding between the LT and LD transfer, certain 
      considerations should be taken into account. The LD transfer has a proven history 
      of successfully treating massive irreparable posterosuperior rotator cuff tears 
      in studies with long-term follow-up(1-6). Alternatively, although the LT transfer 
      has only recently gained popularity, it has the advantage of "in-phase" muscle 
      function, since the trapezius naturally contracts during shoulder external 
      rotation. Furthermore, its line of pull almost completely mimics the 
      infraspinatus.

AB  - In biomechanical modelling and motion analysis, the use of personalised data such 
      as bone geometry would provide more accurate and reliable results. However, there 
      are still a limited number of tools used to measure the evolution of articular 
      interactions. This paper proposes a coherence index to describe the articular 
      status of contact surfaces during motion. The index relies on a robust estimation 
      of the evolution of surfacic interactions between the joint surfaces. The index 
      is first compared to distance maps on simulated motions. It is then used to 
      compare two motion capture protocols (two different localisations of the markers 
      for scapula tracking). The results show that the index detects progressive 
      modifications in the joint and allows distinguishing the two protocols, in 
      accordance with the literature. In the future, the index could, among other 
      things, be used to compare/improve biomechanical models and motion analysis 
      protocols.

TI  - Development of a finite element model of the human shoulder.
PG  - 281-97
AB  - Previous studies have hypothesized that the shoulder may be used to absorb some 
      impact energy and reduce chest injury due to side impacts. Before this hypothesis 
      can be tested, a good understanding of the injury mechanisms and the kinematics 
      of the shoulder is critical for occupant protection in side impact. However, 
      existing crash dummies and numerical models are not designed to reproduce the 
      kinematics and kinetics of the human shoulder. The purpose of this study was to 
      develop a finite element model of the human shoulder in order to achieve a deeper 
      understanding of the injury mechanisms and the kinematics of the shoulder in side 
      impact. Basic anthropometric data of the human shoulder used to develop the 
      skeletal and muscular portions of this model were taken from commercial data 
      packages. The shoulder model included three bones (the humerus, scapula and 
      clavicle) and major ligaments and muscles around the shoulder. This model was 
      then integrated into a human thorax model developed at Wayne State University 
      (WSU) along with pre-existing models of other body parts such as the pelvis and 
      the lower extremities. Material properties used for the model were taken from the 
      literature. The model was first used to simulate lateral shoulder impact study by 
      the Association Peugeot- Renault (APR) followed by simulations of several of the 
      17 rigid and padded cadaveric impacts conducted on a side impact sled at WSU. 
      Contact forces measured at the levels of shoulder, thorax, abdomen and pelvis 
      were used as response variables to validate the model. Additionally, a cadaveric 
      test involving the deployment of a generic side airbag was also used to check the 
      validity of the model. Model prediction of accelerations of the shoulder matched 
      well against those measured experimentally. The role of the shoulder in side 
      impact protection and the reduction of injury to the ribcage are discussed, based 
      on model results.

TI  - Analysis of patient and parent assessment of deformity in idiopathic scoliosis 
      using the Walter Reed Visual Assessment Scale.
PG  - 2158-63
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the Walter Reed Visual Assessment Scale (WRVAS) 
      compared with clinical parameters and written descriptions of the deformity from 
      idiopathic scoliosis patients and their parents. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The 
      WRVAS demonstrates seven visible aspects of spinal deformity in an analogue 
      scale. Higher scores reflect worsening deformity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 
      WRVAS was administered to 182 idiopathic scoliosis patients at four centers in 
      conjunction with open-ended questions about patients' and their parents' 
      perceptions of their spinal deformity. The open-ended responses were categorized 
      as either "deformity noted" or "no deformity noted." RESULTS: WRVAS scores 
      strongly correlate with curve magnitude (P = 0.01) and clearly differentiates 
      curves of 30 degrees or more from lesser curves. Among treatment groups, patients 
      with surgery recommended had significantly higher scores than that of other 
      patients. The instrument differentiated those noting no deformity from those 
      noting a deformity. The correlation between patients' and parents' scores was 
      high (Spearman's rho = 0.8). When a deformity was noted, parents gave higher 
      scores than did their children for rib prominence, shoulder level, scapular 
      rotation, and the total score, but not for the other dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Increasing scores of the WRVAS are strongly correlated with curve magnitude 
      lending construct validity to this type of assessment tool. Patients with 
      "surgery recommended" report more visible deformity on the scale than observed, 
      braced, and postoperative patients, supporting the hypothesis that surgery 
      improves the perceived appearance. Parents perceive more deformity of the ribs 
      and shoulders more than did the patients, but other aspects of the deformity are 
      identified equally. WRVAS scores correlate significantly with curve magnitude and 
      treatment. Parents and patients have similar scores, but with parents perceiving 
      more deformity of the ribs and shoulders than patients.

TI  - Electromyogram (EMG) recordings from the subscapularis muscle: description of a 
      technique.
PG  - 151-3
AB  - Operative treatments for recurrent dislocation of the shoulder usually focus on 
      the subscapularis muscle because it is supposed to contribute to the joint 
      stability. It is of clinical interest to record the EMG from the subscapularis 
      muscle in order to interpret its function. The purpose of the present study was 
      to describe a safe and reliable route to reach the muscle, deeply located between 
      the scapula and the thoracic cage, with fine-wire EMG electrodes. Twenty-four 
      shoulders were investigated in 12 volunteers. A hypodermic needle containing 
      bipolar fine-wire electrodes was inserted in the posterior axillary line with the 
      subjects in the supine position, and the arm held in an abducted and externally 
      rotated position. Three criteria confirmed the location of the electrodes: 
      experience of periosteal pain when the needle reached the costal surface of the 
      scapula, drawing-in of the wires 3-4 cm when the subject adducted his arm, 
      thereby rotating his scapula downward, and raw EMG recorded during typical 
      movements. Additionally, in four shoulders, the electrode location was checked 
      with computed tomography. There were no complications from this technique, and 
      the subjects felt no pain from the fine-wire electrodes during arm movements. We 
      conclude that the described technique is a safe and reliable method of reaching 
      the subscapularis muscle with EMG electrodes.

TI  - Anatomic basis of serratus anterior muscle flap transposition.
PG  - 173-85
AB  - In order to explore the possibility of serratus anterior muscle (SAM) flap 
      transposition in head, neck and thoracic surgery, we performed an anatomic study 
      including 40 dissections of the muscle's vascular pedicle, the 
      subscapular-thoracodorsal axis, which is a branch of the axillary artery. The SAM 
      is characterized by its location: extending from the anterior and lateral aspect 
      of the thorax to the medial border of the scapula; its easy surgical access; its 
      constant and reliable vascularization by the thoracodorsal artery, a branch of 
      the subscapular artery; its long arc of rotation allowing utilization of the SAM 
      flap in head and neck and mediastinal surgery without microvascular anastomoses; 
      its versatility in comparison with other perithoracic muscles. These 
      considerations prompted us to use the SAM in head and neck reconstructive 
      surgery; chest wall surgery, including chest wall reconstruction following 
      resection for tumor and breast reconstruction; intrathoracic and mediastinal 
      surgery, including reinforcement of high-risk tracheobronchial sutures or 
      anastomoses, management of bronchopleural fistulas and empyema spaces, and repair 
      of tracheo-esophageal fistulas and tracheal or esophageal defects.

TI  - Comparison of Locking Plate Fixation and Coracoclavicular Ligament Reconstruction 
      for Neer Type 2B Distal Clavicle Fractures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There remains no consensus regarding which repair technique provides 
      the most optimal results for unstable distal clavicle fractures. PURPOSE: To 
      compare radiologic and clinical outcomes between locking plate fixation and 
      anatomic coracoclavicular (CC) ligament reconstruction for patients with unstable 
      distal clavicle fractures. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. 
      METHODS: The study included 41 patients with Neer type 2B distal clavicle 
      fracture. In group A (n = 15), patients were treated using CC ligament 
      reconstruction with autologous palmaris longus tendon, artificial tape, and 
      Steinmann pin fixation; in group B (n = 26), patients were treated using anatomic 
      locking plate fixation. All patients had a minimum 2 years of follow-up. CC 
      distance and arthrosis of the acromioclavicular joint were assessed 
      radiographically. Clinical outcomes-including range of motion, visual analog 
      scale for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons rating scale, and Constant 
      score-were compared between the groups using the paired Student t test and Fisher 
      exact test. RESULTS: Bone union was attained in all patients. In both groups, the 
      CC distance decreased significantly from presurgery to final follow-up: group A, 
      from 16.25 ± 4.75 to 7.66 ± 2.61 mm (P < .001); group B, from 17.3 ± 4.07 to 9.33 
      ± 2.01 mm (P < .001). The final CC distance was significantly greater in group B 
      (7.66 vs 9.33 mm in groups A and B, respectively; P = .028). Osteoarthritis of 
      the acromioclavicular joint occurred in 13 of 41 patients (3 in group A and 10 in 
      group B). At final follow-up, there was no statistical significance between the 
      groups in range of motion, and clinical outcome scores were satisfactory in both 
      groups, with no statistical difference between them. CONCLUSION: Anatomic locking 
      plate and anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligament showed good clinical 
      results, so both techniques can be considered reliable for restoring stability. 
      However, CC ligament reconstruction had better CC distance on radiologic 
      assessment and did not require removal surgery, so it may be the preferable 
      surgical option to treat unstable distal clavicle fractures (Neer type 2B).

TI  - A comparative analysis of titanium anatomical plate and titanium reconstructive 
      plate for treatment of extraarticular fractures of the scapula (Miller types IIb, 
      IIc, and IV).

LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2021.12.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because of the irregular shape of the scapula and the different types 
      of fractures, a standard internal fixation device is lacking in clinical 
      practice, even though there are many options available. The study aimed to 
      compare the therapeutic efficacy of titanium anatomical and reconstructive plates 
      for extraarticular fractures of the scapula (Miller types IIb, IIc, and IV). 
      METHODS: A retrospective study of 41 patients who underwent treatment for 
      extraarticular fractures of the scapula between March 2017 and March 2020 was 
      conducted. Patients were divided into two groups based on the fixation device, 
      the titanium anatomical plate group (n=20 patients) and the titanium 
      reconstructive plate group (n=21 patients). After follow-up for 12-18 months, the 
      general characteristics, perioperative characteristics, postoperative follow-up 
      findings, and imaging data of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The surgical 
      procedures were uneventful in both groups. The anatomical plate group 
      significantly outperformed the reconstructive plate group with respect to 
      surgical duration and intraoperative blood loss (p < 0.001). At three-month 
      postoperative follow-up, the Constant-Murley score (p = 0.026), shoulder flexion 
      range of motion, and shoulder abduction range of motion in the anatomical plate 
      group were all significantly more effective than those of the reconstructive 
      plate group (p < 0.001). The postoperative WOSI scores of the two groups were 
      similar. Imaging showed functional recovery and stable and reliable fixation in 
      both groups. Time to bone union was similar in both groups (anatomical PLATE 
      GROUP: 9.10 ± 1.25 weeks and reconstructive plate group: 9.24 ± 1.41, p=0.742). 
      No complications occurred in all patients, such as fixation failure, instability 
      or bone nonunion. CONCLUSION: Surgeons should favorably consider titanium 
      anatomical plates for treatment of extraarticular scapula fractures due to their 
      clear efficacy associated with shorter surgical time, less intraoperative blood 
      loss, better fixation, and rapid short-term functional recovery.

TI  - Use of 3D Planning and Patient-specific Guides for Proximal Humerus Corrective 
      Osteotomy Associated With Shoulder Prosthesis Implantation in Proximal Humeral 
      Varus Malunion.
LID - 10.1097/BTH.0000000000000372 [doi]
AB  - Humeral stem prosthesis implantation in case of proximal humerus varus malunion 
      (type 1D fracture sequelae) is often complicated by greater tuberosity fracture 
      and by posterosuperior rotator cuff iatrogenic damage. Moreover, the varus 
      malunited humeral head could lead to scapular impingement and reduce the range of 
      motion. To address this problem, we introduced a new surgical procedure 
      consisting in a proximal humerus osteotomy, planned with three-dimensional (3D) 
      preoperative virtual surgery, and performed with patient-specific surgical 
      guides, to correct humerus deformity before the implantation of the prosthetic 
      humeral stem. A 3D evaluation of the deformity, based on the comparison to the 
      healthy contralateral side or to anatomical standard values, is firstly 
      performed. The metaphyseal osteotomy is then planned and virtually performed. To 
      faithfully reproduce the planned correction, 3D printed surgical guides are 
      prepared. Before the surgery, it is advisable to perform a simulation of the 
      planned osteotomies to verify their real feasibility and to find any critical 
      issues. Preliminary outcomes of this surgical technique are encouraging, but 
      formal studies are warranted to validate its clinical utility and longevity of 
      results.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This paper describes a novel technique developed by the senior 
      author to address acute acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) dislocations and certain 
      distal clavicle fractures. METHODS: The procedure employs a four strand, single 
      tunnel, double endobutton repair performed entirely percutaneously, without any 
      arthroscopic guidance or deep surgical dissection. RESULTS: We present the 
      preliminary results from our series of 6 consecutive patients performed over a 
      period of 18 months. The mean length of surgery was 36min (range 32-40) and the 
      mean correction of coracoclavicular (CC) distance achieved was 12.6 mm (range 
      10.3-14.1). There was no restriction of movement in any of the patients 
      post-operatively and their average QuickDASH scores at final follow-up was 4.2 
      (range 0-6.8). CONCLUSION: Results in the present series were at least comparable 
      to those for other techniques, validating percutaneous treatment as a solution 
      for acute ACJ dislocations.

TI  - The Midterm Results of the Delta Xtend Reverse Shoulder System: A Five-Year 
      Outcome Study.
PG  - 532-538
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the mid-term functional 
      outcomes, radiographic results, and revision rates of patients treated with the 
      Delta Xtend Reverse Shoulder System for both primary and revision arthroplasty 
      indications. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of records for all 
      individuals who underwent a reverse shoulder arthroplasty using the Delta Xtend 
      Reverse Shoulder Prosthesis at a single institution. Radiographic analysis as 
      well as pain and functional measures using the ASES, Quick DASH, SST, SF-12, 
      Penn, SANE, EQ-5D and VAS, and VR-12 scores. Patients were evaluated for 
      five-year outcomes. RESULTS: Fifty patients were available for 5-year outcomes. 
      Thirty-three cases were primary arthroplasty cases and 17 were revision 
      arthroplasty cases. Postoperative radiographs at five years out from surgery were 
      available for 46 patients. The mean AGT overall was 32.6mm: 31.7mm the primary 
      cases and 34.8mm for revision cases. Sirveaux scapular notching was: 65.2% 
      (30/46) at Grade 0, 23.9% (11/46) at Grade 1, and 10.9% (5/46) at Grade 2. 
      Overall, 32/46 of stems were in neutral position, 10/46 were in valgus position, 
      and 4/46 were in varus position. There was no significant correlation between 
      stem position and scapular notching. The mean outcome scores for all patients at 
      five years were good to excellent. Two revision patients demonstrated loosening 
      of the humeral stem on radiographs. Nine patients demonstrated calcification of 
      the long head of the triceps tendon. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the Delta Xtend 
      Reverse Shoulder System has shown to be a reliable arthroplasty system for 
      patients with CTA or failed prior arthroplasty. Patients are generally quite 
      functional at five years out from their reverse shoulder arthroplasty using this 
      implant. Radiographic measures used to interpret the status of the implant 
      demonstrate that AGT is well maintained and scapular notching is minimal for the 
      majority of cases. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.

TI  - Functional Outcome of Modified Weaver Dunn Technique for Acromioclavicular Joint 
      Dislocation.
PG  - 418-422
LID - 10.4103/ortho.IJOrtho_469_16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The debate about the ideal surgical procedure for acromioclavicular 
      joint (ACJ) dislocation is still unresolved and newer techniques are being 
      evolved continuously. The present study evaluates functional outcome of ACJ 
      reconstruction using the modified Weaver Dunn procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      35 patients (26 males, 9 females) with ACJ dislocation, between the age group of 
      18-48 years (mean age 31 years), were operated using modified Weaver Dunn 
      procedure at our center from May 2005 to June 2010. The dominant side was 
      involved in 25 patients (22 right, 13 left). The mean period from the time of 
      injury to the surgery was 14 days (range 4-26 days). All the patients were 
      assessed with Oxford shoulder score and the time required to return to preinjury 
      level was recorded. RESULTS: At the mean followup of 95 months (range 72-120 
      months), the mean Oxford Shoulder Score improved from 25 ± 7.2 to 43 ± 6.9. 85% 
      (30 out of 35) patients had satisfactory results, while 15% (5 out of 35) had 
      mild shoulder dysfunction using this scoring system. Five patients had 
      radiological evidence of Grade 2 ACJ subluxation. Out of these five patients, two 
      developed ossification around the coracoclavicular ligament. Three patients had 
      intermittent mild pain without any functional disability, and one had a moderate 
      restriction of shoulder movements. CONCLUSION: ACJ reconstruction, using the 
      modified Weaver Dunn procedure in ACJ dislocation, is a reproducible procedure 
      and provides a good functional outcome.

TI  - The TESS reverse shoulder arthroplasty without a stem in the treatment of 
      cuff-deficient shoulder conditions: clinical and radiographic results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is a recent concept that 
      enables good functional outcomes in cases of massive rotator cuff tear and cuff 
      tear arthropathy. Design parameters influence the functional results and 
      complications. The purpose of this study is to present the results of a novel 
      RSA, the Total Evolutive Shoulder System (TESS; Biomet, Warsaw, IN, USA), based 
      on a reverse corolla without a stem. METHODS: We enrolled 101 patients with 105 
      RSAs in a prospective study, with a minimum follow-up period of 24 months. The 
      analysis concerned 91 RSAs in 87 patients (61 men and 26 women), with a mean age 
      of 73 years, at a mean follow-up of 41 months (range, 24-69 months). RESULTS: 
      Ninety-six percent of patients rated their satisfaction as good or excellent. 
      Mean flexion was 143° (range, 90°-170°), and mean external rotation was 39° 
      (range, 20°-70°). The Constant score improved from 40 points preoperatively to 68 
      points at last follow-up (P < .001). The mean American Shoulder and Elbow 
      Surgeons score was 24 points. The mean neck-shaft angle was 154° (range, 
      142°-165°). Inferior scapular notching occurred in 17 cases (19%). The notching 
      rate was higher when the glenometaphyseal angle increased (P < .001), when the 
      inferior tilt decreased (P = .003), and when the neck-shaft angle increased. 
      There was no evidence of component loosening. CONCLUSION: TESS RSA provided 
      encouraging midterm results with favorable outcomes and a low rate of 
      complications. The stemless TESS with a reverse corolla is a reliable, less 
      invasive system.

AB  - Inherent disadvantages of reverse shoulder arthroplasty designs based on the 
      Grammont concept have raised a renewed interest in less-medialised designs and 
      techniques. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of reverse shoulder 
      arthroplasty (RSA) with the fully-constrained, less-medialised, Bayley-Walker 
      prosthesis performed for the treatment of rotator-cuff-deficient shoulders with 
      glenohumeral arthritis. A total of 97 arthroplasties in 92 patients (53 women and 
      44 men, mean age 67 years (standard deviation (sd) 10, (49 to 85)) were 
      retrospectively reviewed at a mean follow-up of 50 months ((sd 25) (24 to 96)). 
      The mean Oxford shoulder score and subjective shoulder value improved from 47 (sd 
      9) and 24 points (sd 18) respectively before surgery to 28 (sd 11) and 61 (sd 24) 
      points after surgery (p < 0.001). The mean pain at rest decreased from 5.3 (sd 
      2.8) to 1.5 (sd 2.3) (p < 0.001). The mean active forward elevation and external 
      rotation increased from 42(°)(sd 30) and 9(°) (sd 15) respectively 
      pre-operatively to 78(°) (sd 39) and 24(°) (sd 17) post-operatively (p < 0.001). 
      A total of 20 patients required further surgery for complications; 13 required 
      revision of components. No patient developed scapular notching. The Bayley-Walker 
      prosthesis provides reliable pain relief and reasonable functional improvement 
      for patients with symptomatic cuff-deficient shoulders. Compared with other 
      designs of RSA, it offers a modest improvement in forward elevation, but restores 
      external rotation to some extent and prevents scapular notching. A longer 
      follow-up is required to assess the survival of the prosthesis and the clinical 
      performance over time.

TI  - A quantitative method for determining medial migration of the humeral head after 
      shoulder arthroplasty: preliminary results in assessing glenoid wear at a minimum 
      of two years after hemiarthroplasty with concentric glenoid reaming.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Glenoid erosion and medial migration of the humeral head prosthesis 
      have been observed after most types of shoulder arthroplasty. A method of 
      measuring the change in humeral head position with time after shoulder prosthetic 
      arthroplasty was applied it to 14 shoulders that underwent humeral 
      hemiarthroplasty with concentric glenoid reaming. We hypothesized that the 
      measurement technique would be reproducible and that the rate of wear would be 
      small in the series of shoulders studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Standardized 
      anteroposterior and axillary radiographs were obtained after surgery. Two 
      examiners measured the position of the humeral head center in relation to 
      scapular reference coordinates for the anteroposterior and axillary projections 
      and plotted these values against time after surgery. The change in position was 
      characterized as the slope of this plot. Shoulders were included if there were at 
      least 3 sets of postoperative films, the last being at least 2 years after 
      surgery. RESULTS: The slopes measured by the 2 examiners agreed within 0.5 mm/y 
      for the anteroposterior and the axillary projections. For the series of shoulder 
      arthroplasties, the rate of movement of the head center toward the scapula was 
      less than 0.4 mm/y for either examiner in either projection. DISCUSSION: Medial 
      migration is a concern after any type of shoulder arthroplasty, whether a 
      hemiarthroplasty, a biological interpositional arthroplasty, or a total shoulder 
      arthroplasty. Quantifying the rate of medial migration over time after shoulder 
      arthroplasty is an important element of clinical follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This is 
      an inexpensive, practical, and reproducible method that can be used to determine 
      the rate of medial migration of the humeral head on plain radiographs after 
      shoulder arthroplasty. The average rate of medial migration in the shoulders in 
      this study was small.

TI  - Posterior shoulder pain and anterior instability: a preliminary clinical study.
PG  - 79-83
LID - 10.1007/s12306-007-0013-4 [doi]
AB  - Different clinical tests have been suggested in the literature as significant 
      indicators of anterior shoulder instability. Sometimes patients with recurrent 
      anterior shoulder instability may show some muscular guarding thus making the 
      evaluation of specific clinical tests very difficult. These patients may also 
      report a medical history with posterior shoulder pain that can be also elicited 
      during some clinical manoeuvres. From September 2005 to September 2006 we 
      prospectively studied patients who underwent an arthroscopic anterior 
      capsuloplasty. Shoulder clinical examination was performed including anterior 
      shoulder instability tests (drawer, apprehension and relocation tests). 
      Furthermore the exam was focused on the presence of scapular dyskinesia and 
      posterior shoulder pain. The patients were also evaluated with ASES, Rowe, SST 
      (Simple Shoulder Test), Constant and UCLA (University of California at Los 
      Angeles) scoring system preoperatively and at the latest follow-up time. In the 
      period of this study we observed 16 patients treated for anterior gleno-humeral 
      arthroscopic stabilisation, who preoperatively complained also of a posterior 
      scapular pain. The pain was referred at the level of lower trapezium and upper 
      rhomboids tendon insertion on the medial border of the scapula. It was also 
      reproducible upon local palpation by the examiner. Four of these patients also 
      referred pain in the region of the insertion of the infraspinatus and teres 
      minor. After arthroscopic stabilisation the shoulder was immobilised in a sling 
      with the arm in the neutral rotation for a period of 4 weeks. A single physician 
      supervised shoulder rehabilitation. After a mean time of 6.8 months of follow-up, 
      all the shoulder scores were significantly improved and, moreover, at the same 
      time the patients referred the disappearance of the posterior pain. Posterior 
      scapular shoulder pain seems to be another complaint and sign that can be found 
      in patients affected by anterior shoulder instability. It can also be related to 
      eccentric work of posterior stabilising muscles of scapula during the altered 
      biomechanics observed in case of anterior shoulder instability. This pain 
      responds positively to surgical intervention showing that re-centring the humeral 
      head probably also re-establishes the periscapular muscle-firing pattern with a 
      mechanism mediated by the proprioceptive system.

TI  - Diagnosis and management of the painful shoulder. Part 2: examination, 
      interpretation, and management.
PG  - 152-85
AB  - Diagnosis, interpretation and subsequent management of shoulder pathology can be 
      challenging to clinicians. Because of its proximal location in the schlerotome 
      and the extensive convergence of afferent signals from this region to the dorsal 
      horn of the spinal cord, pain reference patterns can be broadly distributed to 
      the deltoid, trapezius, and or the posterior scapular regions. This pain behavior 
      can make diagnosis difficult in the shoulder region, as the location of symptoms 
      may or may not correspond to the proximity of the pain generator. Therefore, a 
      thorough history and reliable physical examination should rest at the center of 
      the diagnostic process. Effective management of the painful shoulder is closely 
      linked to a tissue-specific clinical examination. Painful shoulder conditions can 
      present with or without limitations in passive and or active motion. Limits in 
      passive motion can be classified as either capsular or noncapsular patterns. 
      Conversely, patients can present with shoulder pain that demonstrates no 
      limitation of motion. Bursitis, tendopathy and rotator cuff tears can produce 
      shoulder pain that is challenging to diagnose, especially when they are the 
      consequence of impingement and or instability. Numerous nonsurgical measures can 
      be implemented in treating the painful shoulder, reserving surgical interventions 
      for those patients who are resistant to conservative care.

TI  - Salvage of infected spinal hardware with paraspinous muscle flaps: anatomic 
      considerations with clinical correlation.
PG  - 521-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Infected spinal stabilization devices represent a significant 
      reconstructive challenge by threatening spinal stability and increasing the risk 
      of neurologic complications. This study provides an anatomic and clinical 
      investigation of posterior midline trunk reconstruction using paraspinous muscle 
      flaps as the primary method of repair. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a 
      series of 25 consecutive patients (mean age, 57.2 years; range, 32-78 years) with 
      complex spinal wounds, reconstructed with paraspinous muscle flaps, at a single 
      university healthcare system. To help define the versatility of these muscle 
      flaps, we also performed cadaveric dissections with lead oxide injections in 10 
      specimens, with an emphasis on regional blood supply, flap width, and arc of 
      rotation. RESULTS: From 1994 to 2000, we successfully reconstructed 25 patients 
      with complex spinal wounds, using 49 paraspinous muscle flaps as the primary 
      method of reconstruction. Hardware present in 22 patients was replaced or 
      retained in 17 cases. Long-term spinal fusion with preservation of neurologic 
      status was observed in all patients, with no cases of dehiscence or reinfection. 
      Wound complications included cerebrospinal fluid leak (1), skin necrosis (1), 
      sinus tracts (3), and seroma (2). Mean length of stay was 24 days (range, 8-57 
      days). One postoperative death occurred. Paraspinous dissections and injections 
      confirmed a segmental type IV blood supply with medial and lateral perforators, 
      arising from intercostal vessels superiorly and lumbar and sacral vessels 
      inferiorly. Flap width was 8 cm at the sacral base, 5 cm at the level of the 
      inferior scapular angle, and 2.5 cm at the first thoracic vertebra. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Paraspinous muscle flaps can be used as the primary reconstructive option to 
      cover and preserve spinal hardware, control local infection, and enable long-term 
      spinal stabilization. Cadaveric dissections confirmed the usefulness of 
      paraspinous flaps, which can be based upon lateral or medial perforators and can 
      be safely mobilized to reliably reconstruct complex spinal wounds.

PG  - 6-11
AB  - Ultrasonography (US) has proved to be a useful diagnostic tool in patients with 
      shoulder pain and/or limited range of motion. It allows careful assessment of a 
      wide range of changes involving many different anatomic structures of the 
      shoulder girdle, such as the rotator cuff tendons (tendonitis, tendon tears and 
      calcific deposits), the long head of the biceps tendon (tenosynovitis, 
      tendonitis, tears, rupture and displacement), the bursae (bursitis), the soft 
      tissues of the gleno-humeral (synovial proliferation, joint effusion) and 
      acromioclavicular joints (synovial proliferation and joint effusion). In 
      addition, it is also a reliable tool in the evaluation of bony profiles detecting 
      the presence of erosions and osteophytes. The use of high quality equipment and 
      the application of a standard scanning protocol are mandatory for reliable US 
      assessment of shoulder pathology.

TI  - Comparative behavior of different life-cycle stages of Ixodes ricinus (Acari: 
      Ixodidae) to human-produced stimuli.
PG  - 234-6
AB  - Nymphs of Ixodes ricinus (Linnaeus, 1758), I. scapularis Say, 1821, and I. 
      pacificus Cooley & Kohls, 1943 are epidemiologically the most dangerous stage for 
      transmission of Lyme disease to humans. Many factors play a role in the 
      epidemiological significance of the nymphs. In this study, we address the 
      question of whether nymphs show a greater tendency than adults to accept humans 
      as their host. To evaluate this, we have compared the host acceptance behavior of 
      nymphs and adults (males and females) with respect to a human in Rambouillet 
      forest, a focus of Lyme disease. Individual ticks (nymph, male or female) located 
      on a herbaceous stem were exposed to different stimuli (e.g., approach, stem 
      movement, breathing), and the response of each individual to these stimuli was 
      noted. Tick responses were categorised into classes (from 0 to 3) according to 
      their intensity. Statistical analysis carried out on 22 ticks allowed us to 
      compare the behavior of the nymph stage with respect to males and females. 
      Despite the small sample sizes, it appears that nymphs are more responsive to a 
      human than are the adults.

TI  - Latent factors in body build of newborns.
PG  - 51-62
AB  - The paper is focused on relationships between traits of newborns and on 
      discerning factors characterizing newborns more generally than individual traits. 
      For this purpose a factor analysis was made using 35 somatic traits of 1013 
      newborns examined in hospitals of Zambrów and Białystok. Main components were 
      found from the correlation matrix, and after the orthogonal rotation of the 
      Varimax type, eight independent factors were identified. The body weight was 
      highly correlated with circumferences of chest, calf, forearm, head, and arm. 
      Body length was correlated with the length of lower extremities, the length of 
      upper extremities was correlated with the length of arm and with the breadth and 
      depth of chest, circumferences of different body parts were correlated with each 
      other, and this was also the case of the thickness of three skin-fat-folds. The 
      following factors were found as a result of the factor analysis (in parentheses 
      there are traits showing highest correlations with a given factor, thus, most 
      suitable for monitoring studies): F1-body weight (thigh circumference), F2-upper 
      extremity length, F3-subcutaneous fat tissue (skin-fat-fold thickness on rib 10), 
      F4-face length and nose diameters (upper-face height), F5-scapular-arm-hip 
      diameters (scapular breadth), F6-trunk length (trunk length), F7-body length 
      (length of lower extremities), and F8-head breadth diameters (mandible breadth).

TI  - Clinical significance of the V-shaped space in the subluxed shoulder of 
      hemiplegics.
PG  - 867-71
AB  - Recently, it has been proposed that shoulder subluxation in hemiplegia is 
      accompanied by 1) the appearance of a V-shaped articular configuration occurring 
      between the humeral head and glenoid fossa and 2) the presence of chronic pain. 
      The main purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of these 
      statements. We evaluated 40 hemiplegic subjects over 3 months. Radiographs of the 
      affected and nonaffected shoulders were taken at both a frontal plane (0 degree) 
      and a 45 degree incidence. From these patients, subluxed (n = 19) and nonsubluxed 
      (n = 21) groups were formed. Pain was evaluated using the Present Pain Intensity 
      index of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. On these x-ray films, measurements were 
      taken of the V-shaped space, abduction of the arm, and rotation of the scapula. 
      The statistical analysis (analysis of variance for repeated measures) contrasted 
      the results obtained from the nonaffected side with those from the affected side 
      over the 3 months studied. At the 45 degree angle, which better exposes the 
      articular configuration of the shoulder, the difference in the V angle between 
      the affected and nonaffected shoulders was significant for the subluxed group (p 
      less than 0.01), indicating that such a V-shaped space can be identified. The 
      measures taken also indicate that a downward subluxation of the humeral head 
      occurs relative to the scapula without any systematic abduction of the humerus or 
      downward rotation of the scapula. None of the results obtained from the frontal 
      plane x-ray films was significant. Finally, no significant relation was found 
      between subluxation and shoulder pain.

TI  - Role of the opercularis muscle in seismic sensitivity in the bullfrog Rana 
      catesbeiana.
PG  - 27-34
AB  - The inner ear of anuran amphibians appears to be exceptionally sensitive to 
      substrate vibration. The opercularis system, consisting of an opercularis muscle 
      running from the shoulder girdle to a movable, cartilaginous operculum lying next 
      to the inner ear, has been hypothesized to be involved in driving these seismic 
      responses. Removal of the opercularis muscle of adult bullfrogs, Rana 
      catesbeiana, caused clear decreases in microphonic responses of the inner ear to 
      vibrations from 20-250 Hz and 0.05-5.0 cm/sec2 accelerations. Degree of decrease 
      in responsiveness was variable between individuals and between different 
      frequencies of stimulation, ranging up to 90% reduction at certain frequencies 
      and in certain specimens. Decreases were most marked at lower frequencies below 
      about 50 Hz. Additional removal of the levator scapulae superior muscle, which 
      runs alongside the opercularis muscle from the shoulder girdle to ventrolateral 
      portions of the otic capsule, also tended to depress responses, although this 
      effect was substantially less (generally less than 10%) and also less consistent. 
      As the opercularis muscle appears to be derived from the levator scapulae 
      musculature, it is speculated that primitively seismic sensitivity was enhanced 
      by a muscular connection that could transmit motion from the forelimb to the otic 
      region, responsiveness being further enhanced by the subsequent evolution of the 
      specialized opercularis system.

TI  - Iatrogenic instability of the acromioclavicular joint leads to ongoing impairment 
      of shoulder function even following secondary surgical stabilization.
LID - 10.1007/s00402-022-04387-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Iatrogenic instability of the acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) following 
      distal clavicle excision (DCE) represents an infrequent pathology. Revision 
      surgery to restore ACJ stability and alleviate concomitant pain is challenging 
      due to altered anatomic relationships. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
      the used salvage techniques and postoperative functional and radiological 
      outcomes in retrospectively identify patients with a painful ACJ following DCE. 
      We hypothesized that iatrogenic instability leads to ongoing impairment of 
      shoulder function despite secondary surgical stabilization. METHODS: 9 patients 
      with a painful ACJ after DCE (6 men, 3 women, 43.3 ± 9.4 years) were followed up 
      at a minimum of 36 months after revision surgery. Besides range of motion (ROM), 
      strength and function were evaluated with validated evaluation tools including 
      the Constant score and the DASH score (Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand 
      questionnaire), specific AC Score (SACS), Nottingham Clavicle Score (NCS), Taft 
      score and Acromioclavicular Joint Instability Score (AJI). Additionally, 
      postoperative X-rays were compared to the unaffected side, measuring the 
      coracoclavicular (CC) and acromioclavicular (AC) distance. RESULTS: At follow-up 
      survey (55.8 ± 18.8 months) all patients but one demonstrated clinical ACJ 
      stability after arthroscopically assisted anatomical ACJ reconstruction with an 
      autologous hamstring graft. Reconstruction techniques were dependent on the 
      direction of instability. The functional results demonstrated moderate shoulder 
      and ACJ scores with a Constant Score of 77.3 ± 15.4, DASH-score of 51.2 ± 23.4, 
      SACS 32.6 ± 23.8, NCS 77.8 ± 14.2, AJI 75 ± 14.7 points and Taft Score 7.6 ± 3.4 
      points. All patients stated they would undergo the revision surgery again. Mean 
      postoperative CC-distance (8.3 ± 2.8 mm) did not differ significantly from the 
      contralateral side (8.5 ± 1.6 mm) (p > 0,05). However, the mean AC distance was 
      significantly greater with 16.5 ± 5.8 mm compared to the contralateral side 
      (3.5 ± 1.9 mm) (p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Symptomatic iatrogenic ACJ instability 
      following DCE is rare. Arthroscopically assisted revision surgery with an 
      autologous hamstring graft improved ACJ stability in eight out of nine cases 
      (88.9%). However, the functional scores showed ongoing impairment of shoulder 
      function and a relatively high overall complication rate (33.3%). Therefore, this 
      study underlines the importance of precise preoperative indication and planning 
      and, especially, the preservation of ACJ stability when performing AC joint 
      resection procedures. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Case series, LEVEL IV.

TI  - Lateral clavicle fracture with coracoclavicular ligament injury: a biomechanical 
      study of 4 different repair techniques.
PG  - 2013-2019
LID - 10.1007/s00167-017-4444-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the biomechanical performance of four different methods 
      used for coracoclavicular (CC) ligament reconstruction in a lateral clavicle 
      fracture repair. METHODS: Native displacement, translation, and rotation at the 
      acromioclavicular joint of 24 fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were tested. A 
      reproducible fracture in the lateral third of the clavicle was created by 
      dissecting both CC ligaments. Each specimen was then repaired with plate fixation 
      of the fracture and the following CC repair technique: (1) Cortical button. (2) 
      Suture anchor and plate button. (3) Suture anchor no plate button, and (4) Suture 
      around coracoid. All reconstructed specimens were then re-tested for 
      displacement, translation, and load to failure, and compared to their native 
      results. Groups 1 and 3 were investigated for rotational load. RESULTS: There was 
      no difference in load to failure between the repaired groups (p: ns). Group 1 
      showed less superior and anterior translations (p < 0.05). Group 2 showed 
      significantly less superior translation (p = 0.003), but no significance with 
      anterior and posterior translations to the native joint. Group 3 showed less 
      superior and posterior translations (p = 0.005 and p = 0.039). Anterior and 
      posterior translations were increased in group 4 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The 
      biomechanical analyses did not show any significance in load to failure or 
      displacement after cyclic loading among the study groups. All repairs were 
      effective in preventing superior translation. Groups 1 and 2 demonstrated 
      increased horizontal stability compared to the native state. All 4 methods are 
      clinically viable options for CC ligament repair.

TI  - The efficacy of exercise therapy in reducing shoulder pain related to breast 
      cancer: a systematic review.
PG  - 321-30
LID - 10.3138/ptc.2012-06 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Recent research indicates that physiotherapy interventions, such as 
      exercise and manual therapy, may be effective in decreasing the frequency of side 
      effects linked with breast cancer treatment, including fatigue, pain, nausea, and 
      decreased quality of life. This systematic review aims to determine the efficacy 
      of exercise therapy in reducing shoulder pain related to breast cancer treatment 
      and to identify outcome measures that can be used to assess shoulder pain in this 
      population. METHODS: A systematic review of the current literature was conducted 
      using portals such as the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), the Cumulative 
      Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE 
      (1996 to April 2011), and Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) (1985 to April 
      2011). Databases were searched for relevant studies published up to April 2011. 
      Participants in relevant studies were adults (≥18 years of age) with a primary 
      diagnosis of breast cancer at any point during the treatment of their disease. 
      RESULTS: Six articles were independently appraised by two blinded reviewers. Six 
      studies met the inclusion criteria, each analyzing different types of 
      exercise-shoulder/arm/scapular strengthening/stabilization, postural exercises, 
      general exercises and conditioning, shoulder range-of-motion exercises, and 
      lymphedema exercises-with respect to their efficacy in reducing shoulder pain 
      related to breast cancer treatment. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS suggest that exercise 
      targeting shoulder pain related to breast cancer treatment may be effective. 
      However, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn due to the lack of methodological 
      quality and homogeneity of the studies included. Clinicians should use valid 
      outcome measures, such as the visual analogue scale and brief pain inventory, to 
      evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment.

TI  - Evaluation of the use of the hook plate in Neer type 2 lateral clavicle fractures 
      and Rockwood types 3-5 acromioclavicular joint dislocations.
PG  - 619-26
LID - 10.1007/s00068-013-0303-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: For most types of acromioclavicular (AC) injuries, treatment is well 
      established. For Neer type 2 lateral clavicle fractures and Rockwood types 3-5 AC 
      dislocations, the ideal treatment is still a point of debate. The purpose of this 
      study was to evaluate the functional and radiological outcome in patients treated 
      for one of these two lesions in our hospital. METHODS: Our study group consisted 
      of 30 patients with a Neer type 2 lateral clavicle fracture (n = 19) or Rockwood 
      types 3-5 AC dislocation (n = 11) treated with the clavicle hook plate. All 
      implants were removed after healing. At a mean follow-up of 40 months (12-92), 
      data were collected by the analysis of questionnaires (DASH, NSST, OSS, SF-36), 
      clinical examination (Constant-Murley score), and radiological evaluation (Zanca 
      view). RESULTS: The mean Constant score was 88 [standard deviation (SD) 8] 
      compared to 92 (SD 6) on the contralateral non-operated side. The questionnaires 
      resulted in the following scores: median DASH: 4.5 (0-70); median NSST: 100 
      (8-100); mean OSS: 41 (SD 8); mean SF-36: 81 (SD 12). The mean coracoclavicular 
      (CC) and AC distances were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      suggests that hook plate fixation is a reliable treatment for Neer type 2 lateral 
      clavicle fractures and Rockwood types 3-5 AC injuries. It results in a good and 
      comparable function of the shoulder when compared to the contralateral side, high 
      union rate, good to excellent objective and subjective results, and allows early 
      active motion with limited abduction. A disadvantage is the necessity to remove 
      the plate.

AB  - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 4-year-old sexually intact male Labrador Retriever-Poodle mix 
      was admitted to the hospital for treatment of a wound in the left thoracic 
      region. The wound had been debrided and primary closure had been performed by the 
      referring veterinarian 4 days previously. CLINICAL FINDINGS: The dog had a 
      20-cm-long wound covered by a large flap of skin that extended caudally from the 
      scapula over the left side of the thorax. A 3-cm defect was evident at the 
      cranioventral aspect of the wound, from which purulent material was being 
      discharged. The skin flap was necrotic, and the skin surrounding the flap was 
      bruised. Signs of pain were elicited when the wound and surrounding region were 
      palpated. Other findings, including those of thoracic radiography, were 
      unremarkable. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: The wound was debrided, and vacuum-assisted 
      closure (VAC) was initiated for 3 days until a healthy bed of granulation tissue 
      developed. A reconstructive procedure was performed with a rotation flap 3 days 
      after VAC dressing removal. The VAC process was reinitiated 2 days following 
      reconstruction because of an apparent failing of the skin flap viability. After 5 
      days of VAC, the flap had markedly improved in color and consistency and VAC was 
      discontinued. Successful healing of the flap occurred without the need for 
      debridement or additional intervention. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Use of VAC led to a 
      good overall outcome for the dog, with complete healing achieved. Additional 
      evaluation of this technique for salvaging failing skin flaps is warranted in 
      dogs, particularly considering that no reliable method for flap salvage in 
      veterinary species has been reported to date.

TI  - Phalloplasty in complete aphallia and ambiguous genitalia.
PG  - 196-205
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1281489 [doi]
AB  - The most common indications for phalloplasty in children include aphallia, 
      micropenis/severe penile inadequacy, ambiguous genitalia, phallic inadequacy 
      associated with epispadias/bladder exstrophy and female to male gender 
      reassignment in adolescents. There are many surgical options for phalloplasty; 
      both local pedicled tissue as well as free tissue transfer. The advantages of 
      local tissue include a more concealed donor site, less complex operation and 
      potentially faster recovery. However, pedicled options are generally less 
      sensate, making placement of a penile prosthesis more risky and many children 
      with bladder exstrophy have been previously operated upon making the blood supply 
      for local pedicled flaps less reliable. This Here the authors discuss free tissue 
      transfer, including the radial forearm, the anterolateral thigh, the scapula and 
      latissimus, and the fibula free flaps, as well as local rotational flaps from the 
      abdomen, groin, and thigh. The goal of reconstruction should be an aesthetic and 
      functional (ability to penetrate) phallus, which provides tactile and erogenous 
      sensation, and the ability to urinate standing. Ideally, the operation should be 
      completed in one to two operations with minimal donor site morbidity. There are 
      advantages and disadvantages of each of flap and thus the choice of donor site 
      should be a combination of the patient's preference and surgeon's ability to 
      produce a consistent result.

      elderly.
PG  - 583-9
LID - 10.1016/j.otsr.2011.03.025 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to analyze the long-term results and 
      possible complications of the Grammont reverse shoulder prosthesis in the 
      management of recent trauma in the elderly patient. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two 
      male and 33 female patients of mean age 75 years (range, 58 to 92), operated on 
      for 24 fractures and eleven facture-dislocations, involving the right side in 11 
      cases and the left side in 24 cases, were included in a retrospective study and 
      were clinically and radiographically evaluated at a mean follow-up ranging from 1 
      to 17 years. RESULTS: Eight complications occurred in eight patients (23%): two 
      complex regional pain syndromes, four dislocations, one deep infection and one 
      aseptic loosening of the metaglene. Six patients (17%) had to be reoperated on, 
      without prosthetic replacement in four cases and with revision of their shoulder 
      implant in two. The mean Constant score decreased from 55 to 53 between one 
      postoperative year and last follow-up since patients complained of increased pain 
      and strength loss. This score was 69% of that of the contralateral shoulder. The 
      adjusted Constant score was 68%. Only 58% of the patients were "satisfied" or 
      "very satisfied" with the treatment due to limited shoulder rotations thus 
      preventing proper eating, dressing and body hygiene habits when injury involved 
      the dominant side. Two cases of complete lucent lines surrounding the glenoid 
      component were observed at four and eight postoperative years respectively, a 
      stable inferior bony spur was noted in 14 cases at a mean follow-up of 2.5 years 
      with no functional effects, 20 cases of scapular notching having occurred within 
      two-year follow-up were identified, 10 of which associated with bone resorption 
      and medial proximal humeral lucent lines at the bone-cement interface. The extent 
      of scapular notching progressed with the length of follow-up. Forty-nine percent 
      of the radiographic images were considered abnormal and appeared within 
      seven-year follow-up in 60% of the cases. Clinical and radiographic data 
      comparison revealed a decrease in the Constant score regarding pain, activity, 
      strength and active elevation when scapular notching was associated with abnormal 
      humeral radiographic images. DISCUSSION: Despite one single case of aseptic 
      loosening of the metaglene at 12-year follow-up, the results of our series are 
      clinically disappointing and radiographically worrying associated with a 
      substantial rate of complications and reopperations. The long-term functional 
      outcome is far from being identical to the pre-trauma clinical status with a 
      potential evolution toward loss of autonomy when the dominant side is affected. 
      New prosthetic design characteristics and surgical technique improvements should 
      be implemented to improve shoulder adduction but also rotations while preventing 
      the occurrence of scapular notching. In the light of these results, we cannot 
      validate the concept of primary reverse shoulder arthroplasty in the management 
      of recent trauma of the proximal humerus.

TI  - [Grammont reversed prosthesis for acute complex fracture of the proximal humerus 
      in an elderly population with 5 to 12 years follow-up].
PG  - 543-8
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Aim of this retrospective study was to analyze outcome in 
      23 cases of Delta III reverse ball-and-socket total shoulder prosthesis for acute 
      complex fractures of the proximal humerus in an elderly population with poor bone 
      quality. In such a population, this procedure could escape the difficulties of a 
      reliable and efficient refixation of the tubercles. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 
      1993 to 2000, 23 Delta III prostheses were implanted by a single operator for 
      acute injury: 18 three-part and four-part fractures and 5 fracture-dislocations. 
      The study population included two men and 21 women, mean age 75 years, 10 
      dominant sides. Surgery was performed under general anesthesia in the 
      semi-sitting position via the anterolateral approach without osteotomy of the 
      acromion, with 10-20 degrees retroversion of the humeral stem (except in one 
      shoulder) and cement fixation in two. For five shoulders, the tubercles could be 
      re-fixed. Postoperative physiotherapy was not possible in all patients. Outcome 
      was assessed with the Constant score and with ap and lateral Lamy radiographs. 
      RESULTS: Seven patients died so the series included sixteen cases for analysis. 
      Complications were: reflex sympathetic dystrophy (n=2), postoperative 
      Acinetobacter infection (n=1) requiring revision to clean and drain allowing 
      preservation of the prosthesis, and early postoperative anterior dislocation 
      (n=1) (10 degrees stem anteversion) with surgical revision to re-orient the stem. 
      At mean follow-up of 86 months, the Constant score was 60 points (contralateral 
      shoulder 83 points). Outcome, influenced in case of re-fixation of the tubercles, 
      was good for pain (14.1), activity (13.3), strength (16.1), anterior elevation 
      (6.5), and abduction (6.5), but very poor for external (1.1) and internal (2.4) 
      rotations. The radiographs showed: aseptic glenoid loosening (n=1) at 12 years 
      with surgical revision in 2005 with Constant score at 6 months follow-up of 48 
      points, inferior scapular notching (n=11) according the the Nérot classification 
      (six stage 1, four stage 2, one stage 3, at 2, 4.3 and 5 years follow-up), 
      inferior spurs (n=9) appearing at mean 2.5 years follow-up (stable after 
      emergence without clinical impact), proximal humeral resorption (n=4) (medially 
      for three at mean 8 year follow-up and one laterally at 10 years), and a humeral 
      radiolucent line (n=1) at 5 years follow-up. DISCUSSION: For acute complex 
      fractures of the proximal humerus in elderly subjects with poor bone quality, 
      when an efficient and reliable re-fixation of the tubercles is difficult or 
      impossible, reverse ball-and-socket shoulder prosthesis is a possible alternative 
      providing good functional outcome except for rotations but with the risk of 
      inferior scapular notching. Although not problematic in the mid term, these 
      notches may contribute to glenoid loosening with bone loss in the long-term. 
      Nevertheless, this procedure seems to improve the status of patients with such 
      fractures.

TI  - [Clinical application of rhombotrapezious island musculocutaneous flap for skull 
      base and/or craniomaxillary operation with malignant tumor].
PG  - 203-6
AB  - Regional pedicled musculocutaneous flaps are the mainstay of the head and neck 
      reconstruction. They provide a rapid, highly reliable and single-staged technique 
      that is applicable in most cases. The rhombotrapezious island musculocutaneous 
      flap is valuable in the base and craniomaxilloface reconstruction. In this study 
      we updated our experience with the rhombotrapezious island musculocutaneous flap 
      (RTIMF) in 6 cases from 1989 to 1993. Dissections were performed on 9 cadavers, 4 
      preserved and 5 fresh, yielding 18 pairs or dorsal scapular and transverse 
      cervical artery for evaluation. In the five fresh cadavers, the arteries were 
      selectively cannulated and injected with colored latex. 67% with dorsal scapular 
      and transverse cervical artery commonly arose from the thyro-cervical trunk. 33% 
      with the dorsal scapular artery directly arose from the second part of the 
      subclavian artery. In the period of 1989-1993, 6 rhombotrapezious island 
      musculocutaneous flaps with vascularized pedicle were used for immediate repair 
      in the skull base or craniomaxillary cancer operations. There was no complication 
      of the flaps. Donor site complications were relatively minor. The disturbance in 
      shoulder function was well tolerated. We advocated the incorporation of both the 
      greater and lesser rhomboid muscle to form the compound rhombotrapezious flaps to 
      enhance the vascular supply to the overlying skin. The major advantage of the 
      RTIMF are that it provides a long paddle of thin pliant, hairless skin and muscle 
      that can be rotated as far as the craniomaxilloface and scalp in a single stage. 
      It offers the longest arc of rotation and thus the greatest versatility for the 
      skull base or craniomaxillary reconstruction.

TI  - The spinal accessory nerve and its entry point into the posterior triangle of the 
      neck.
LID - 10.5603/FM.a2022.0014 [doi]
AB  - The course of the spinal accessory nerve in the neck is long and superficial 
      rendering it at high risk of injury during procedures performed in the posterior 
      triangle. The majority of spinal accessory nerve injuries are iatrogenic in 
      nature. This is associated with significant morbidity including reduction in 
      shoulder movements, drooping of the shoulder, winging of the scapula and 
      neuropathic pain. Knowledge of the nerve anatomy reduces the risk of 
      intra-operative nerve injury. Traditional teaching describes the point of entry 
      into the posterior triangle as the intersection between the upper and middle 
      third of the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid. The aim of this study was 
      to determine whether this is in fact the case and if so, whether this landmark 
      can reliably be used to identify the spinal accessory nerve in order to improve 
      patient outcomes. The spinal accessory nerve was identified unilaterally in 26 
      cadavers. The total length of sternocleidomastoid was measured as well as the 
      length along the posterior border from the inferior aspect of the mastoid process 
      to the point at which the accessory nerve enters the posterior triangle of the 
      neck. These measurements were used to calculate the ratio of the entry point of 
      the nerve into the posterior triangle along the length of the posterior border of 
      sternocleidomastoid from its superior insertion point. The mean ratio was 0.35 
      with 95% confidence intervals of 0.33 to 0.36. Our findings confirm the 
      traditional description of the entry point of the spinal accessory nerve into the 
      posterior triangle of the neck. We describe a so-called 'safe zone' inferior to 
      the midpoint of the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid within which the 
      spinal accessory nerve is unlikely to be found, thereby reducing the risk of 
      iatrogenic injury.

AB  - Scapular dyskinesis can be present in healthy individuals as in patients with 
      shoulder pathology.Altered patterns of scapular kinematics can cause or 
      exacerbate rotator cuff tear pathology. However, more research is 
      needed.Regardless of the cause or the consequence of rotator cuff tear, scapular 
      dyskinesis impairs shoulder function, worsens the symptoms, and compromises the 
      success of clinical intervention.The available literature suggests physical 
      therapy as the first treatment for degenerative cuff tears, and scapular 
      dyskinesis should be addressed if present. Non-responsive cases or traumatic 
      tears may require surgery.Postsurgical physical therapy protocols after rotator 
      cuff repair must consider scapular dyskinesia to improve the outcomes. Cite this

TI  - [Precise application of Traditional Chinese Medicine in minimally-invasive 
      techniques].
PG  - 493-496

AB  - The miminally-invasive techniques of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) uses 
      different types of acupuncture needles to treat diseased locations with special 
      techniques. These techniques include different methods of insertion and closed 
      incision (press cutting, sliding cutting, scrape cutting, etc.). This needling 
      technique is based on the traditional Chinese medicine theories of Pi 
      Bu(cutaneous), Jing Jin(sinew), Jing Luo(meridian), Wu Ti(five body structure 
      components) and Zang Fu(organ system). Commonly used needles include: needle Dao, 
      needle with edge, Pi needle, Shui needle, Ren needle, Gou needle, Chang Yuan 
      needle, Bo needle and so on. The principle of this minimally-invasive technique 
      of TCM is to achieve the greatest healing benefit with the least amount of 
      anatomical and physiological intervention. This will result in the highest 
      standard of health care with the lowest rehabilitative need and burden of care. 
      In the past 20 years, through the collaborative research of several hundred 
      hospitals across China, we systemically reviewed the best minimally invasive 
      technique of TCM and the first line treatments for selective conditions. In 2013, 
      the Department of Medical Affairs of the State Administration of Traditional 
      Chinese Medicine created "Traditional Chinese Medicine Technical Manual"(General 
      Version) and released it nationwide, its contents include: (1)Minimally invasive 
      scar tissue release. ¹Suitable for Bi and pain syndromes of neck, shoulder, 
      waist, buttocks and extremities. ²Degeneration causes local hypertrophy and 
      inflammation, creating local tissue adhesion. ³There are two kind incision 
      methods-press cutting and slide cutting. (2)Minimally invasive fascial tension 
      release. ¹Suitable for localized fascial tension caused by trauma, overuse, or 
      wind-cold-dampness, leading to compensatory hyperplasia. ²Long term high-stress 
      stimulation to local fascia creates compensatory hyperplasia, Ashi points, and 
      tissue texture changes (cords, nodules, masses). ³According to the different 
      structural features of the needles, there are two incision methods: penetrating 
      from the outside to the inside and pulling from inside to outside. (3)Minimally 
      invasive decompression technique. ¹Suitable for internal pressure changes within 
      organ cavities caused by trauma, degeneration, inflammation, such as compartment 
      syndrome, bone marrow edema, increased intraluminal pressure in the bone marrow. 
      ²According to the different tissues, it is categorized into soft tissue 
      decompression, and bone decompression. (4)Minimally invasive orthopedic surgery. 
      Applicable to some postural, developmental deformity correction, mainly through 
      the dynamic balance method and/or static balance method. (5)Minimally invasive 
      dissection. Suitable for fractures, tendons injury caused by deep soft tissue 
      adhesion. (6)Minimally invasive separation. ¹Suitable for cutaneous, sinew 
      regions, superficial adhesions due to lesions, and local post-operative incision 
      adhesions. ²According to the structure of the needle tip, the methods are divided 
      into sharp separation and blunt dissection. (7)Minimally invasive sustained 
      pressure technique. ¹Suitable for neuromuscular dysfunction which causes 
      JING(spasm) syndrome and WEI(atrophy) syndrome. ²The needle is applied with 
      sustained pressure, without penetrating select tissue surface. This includes: 
      nerve root sustained pressure technique; peripheral nerve sustained pressure 
      technique; muscle sustained pressure technique; fascial contact procedure; 
      cutaneous sustained pressure technique.(8)Minimally invasive insertion technique. 
      ¹Suitable for systemic regulation to treat disease. ²Different organs are 
      connected to different layers of tissue. Therefore, to treat specific conditions, 
      specific tissues must be targeted. ³For example, back Shu points are used to 
      treat vertigo from cervical spine issues, and spinal degeneration associated 
      digestion issue. ⁴The internal organs can be regulated by the pathways that runs 
      along the different layers of tissue. The types of stimulation include: meridian 
      acupoint stimulation; cutaneous stimulation; fascia stimulation; mucle 
      stimulation; periosteum stimulation. The clinical application of these techniques 
      has enriched the drug-free therapies of traditional Chinese medicine and achieved 
      excellent outcomes, but at the same time it also raises an important question. 
      How can we apply these minimally invasive techniques to clinical practice so it 
      can be safe and effective? In addition, how can practitioners, individually and 
      further develop their understanding of this minimally invasive technique 
      progressive manner? We make the following recommendations. (1)Clear diagnosis and 
      precise application. Any approach has specific indications and choosing the 
      correct technique comes from a comprehensive understanding of its advantages and 
      disadvantages. Moreover, the accurate application of the technique depends the 
      expertise of the practitioner. Through systematic review and clinical 
      observation, we formulated the First Line Treatment, the Second Line Treatment, 
      and the Third Line Treatment for specific conditions. Using the information 
      gathered from research, practitioners can decide on which point is appropriate to 
      use based on the stage of disease progression. For example, common conditions 
      like the nerve ending tension pain(i.e. cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome) is 
      caused by stress concentration. There are two types of treatment for this 
      condition: ¹Change in the response to stress state (i.e.non-invasive approach 
      such as manual therapy and physiotherapy). ²Change in state of surrounding 
      environment (i.e. invasive approach such as Pi Needle). Before tissue texture 
      changes to pain point, cord, nodules, the former approach is effective. Once 
      tissue texture changes, the latter approach is First Line Treatment. 
      (2)Systematic training and disease progression training. The minimally invasive 
      techniques of traditional Chinese medicine can treat many kinds of disease. To 
      ensure its safety, organization, progressive development, practitioners are 
      trained systematically and manage their treatment approach through disease 
      hierarchy. Moreover, this technique should be conducted according to its 
      technical difficulty, operating conditions, and expertise of the practitioner. 
      The application of minimally invasive techniques of traditional Chinese medicine 
      does not depend on the hospitals' administration system or the regulatory college 
      of medical professionals. The minimally invasive techniques of TCM should be 
      taught from easy to difficult, simple to complicated, and requires gradual 
      progression by the practitioners. Eventually, the minimally invasive techniques 
      of TCM's diagnostic and treatment protocol can be created. These protocols are 
      currently available for reference: ¹Forming diagnosis and differential diagnosis 
      for the conditions below requires expert diagnostic and application skills: 
      cerebral palsy; cervical vertigo; cervical headache; cervical precordial pain; 
      other spine-related diseases. ²The requirements for the diagnosis and 
      differential diagnosis of such techniques are relatively high, and special 
      training is required for the practitioner who performs this technique. The 
      conditions below uses minimally invasive orthopedic surgery and dissection: scar 
      contracture deformity; congenital developmental malformations; cervical 
      Bi-syndrome; shoulder pain syndrome; knee Bi-syndrome; low back pain; cervical 
      spondylosis; lumbar disc herniation; avascular necrosis of the femoral head; 
      ankylosing spondylitis. ³There are no special requirements for the diagnosis and 
      differential diagnosis of such techniques, and special training is required for 
      the practitioner who performs this technique. The technical content is mainly 
      decompression and scar tissue release. a)Muscle strain diseases: levator 
      scapulae, splenius capitis, splenius cervicis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, 
      teres minor, teres major, serratus posterior superior, serratus posterior 
      inferior, piriformis, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus, 
      erector spinae. b)Joint degenerative disorders: frozen shoulder, tennis elbow, 
      tenosynovitis, knee osteoarthritis, and plantar fascitis. c)JING-JIN PI-BU pain 
      syndrome (cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome): occipital great nerve entrapment 
      syndrome, occipital small nerve entrapment syndrome, great auricular nerve 
      entrapment syndrome, suprascapular nerve entrapment syndrome, transverse 
      cutaneous nerve of neck entrapment syndrome. (3)People-centred practice. The most 
      attractive feature of the minimally invasive techniques of TCM is that they do 
      not rely on expensive medical equipment and operating conditions. The key to 
      applying this technique is the practitioners' technique, skill, and expertise. 
      The necessary conditions required to successfully apply this technique is 
      ¹practitioner understands disease progression and diagnosis; ²practitioners' 
      skill in applying technique. We require patient-centered approach, which uses 
      evidence based approach as the focus. We aim to seek the truth from facts, to 
      understand the comprehensive picture, to include pertinent details, to be 
      observant, to be goal oriented, from one to another, from outside to inside, from 
      top to the bottom, compare right from left, through active movement and passive 
      movements and weight-bearing movements, and assisted passive movements to 
      determine instantaneous centre to diagnose stress concentration points. The 
      operating technique is based on the response of patient's tissues to this 
      technique. We must pay attention to diagnosis through palpation: layers, 
      structure, texture, deformity, dislocation, movement characteristic, rhythmic 
      changes. To achieve SHOU MO XIN HUI WU WEI: position, quantify, quantity, timing, 
      and pattern. Accurate grasp of timeliness and dose efficiency. Can distinguish 
      between local or systemic effects of treatment. Through comprehensive judgment of 
      hands feeling, acupuncture needle feeling, and inspiration, to achieve the 
      precious treatment requirements as indicated by the "Huangdi Neijing·Suwen": 
      "Puncture the bone without damaging tendons, and puncture tendons without 
      damaging muscles, puncture the muscle without damaging pulse, puncture pulse 
      without damaging skin, puncture skin without damaging muscle. Puncture muscle 
      without damage tendons, puncture tendons without damaging bone... Puncture bone 
      without damaging tendons and it means the needle passes through the tendons and 
      arrives at the bone and work on the bone. Puncture tendons without damaging 
      muscles, and it means the needle passes through the muscles and arrives close to 
      the tendon. Puncture the muscle without damaging pulse and it means the needle 
      passes the pulse and does not touch the muscle. Puncture pulse without damaging 
      skin and it means, the needle passes through the skin without penetrating pulse. 
      Puncture skin without damaging muscle and it means, the disease is in the skin 
      and the needles insert into skin but does not damage muscle. Puncture muscle 
      without damage tendons, and it means, the needle passes through the muscle and 
      arrive on the tendon. Puncture tendons without damaging bone."
