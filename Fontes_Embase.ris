N2  - Background: Adhesive capsulitis (AC) of the shoulder or frozen shoulder is a debilitating condition characterized by progressive pain, stiffness and limited range of motion about the glenohumeral joint, the term (adhesive capsulitis) to describe the findings of chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the joint capsule, characterized by significant restriction of both active and passive shoulder motion that occurs in the absence of a known intrinsic shoulder disorder. The goal of the trial was to examine the association between clinical features (stages) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. Results: In our study, Regarding the diagnostic performance of shoulder MRI there is a statistically significant difference between degree of pain intensity according to Capsular thickening regarding humeral “mm” with p-value (p < 0.05). The highest value was found moderate and severe pain group (5.67 ± 1.39) compared to absent, minimal and mild pain group (4.42 ± 1.29), there was a statistically significant difference between two groups according to axillary recess regarding height “mm” with p-value (p < 0.05). The highest value was found absent, minimal and mild pain group (7.02 ± 2.68) compared to moderate and severe pain group (5.73 ± 2.25). There is no statistically significant association between pain intensity and MRI finding regarding capsular edema, extra capsular edema, obliteration of subcoracoid fat triangle, effusion of biceps tendon sheath, capsular thickening of glenoid (mm) and humeral portions of axillary recess and axillary recess width and height (mm), with p-value (p > 0.05 NS). Conclusions: MRI is useful for assessing clinical impairment and predicting the clinical stage of adhesive capsulitis.

N2  - Multiple biomechanical shoulder simulators have been described in the literature, with a trend toward increasing complexity to better simulate clinical scenarios. Our objective was to develop an advanced, novel shoulder joint simulator and compare outcomes at two separate institutions, for a typical shoulder joint motion simulation. Identical shoulder simulators were developed & deployed at both institutions. Eight cadaveric upper extremities were tested by simulating actively controlled, arm elevation in the plane of the scapula for two sequential test conditions (intact and nondestructive simulated cuff-tear), each repeated for a total of five trials. Muscle forces and joint translations were recorded for both conditions. The intact condition was repeated following simulated cuff-tear to assess effect of testing order. Statistical analyses were aimed at assessing repeatability and reproducibility of results within specimens, between specimens, and between institutions. The highest average forces were observed for the middle deltoid (233N or 32.5% body weight (BW)), followed by infraspinatus (99.0N), and posterior deltoid (93.7N) muscles. Differentiation between test conditions was unhindered by variability between repeated trials. Data from testing repeated over time, and between the two institutions were not significantly different. The novel shoulder simulator produced repeatable results with low trial-to-trial variation and outcomes were comparable between the two institutions. The results demonstrated a consistent response in muscle forces and humeral translation for the simulated rotator cuff tear condition. Such advanced shoulder simulators could thus be used for evaluating and optimizing surgical interventions and implant strategies.

N2  - Background: The number of Total Shoulder Arthroplasties (TSA) has increased in these last years with significant increase of clinical success. However, glenoid component loosening remains the most common cause of failure. Objective: In this study we evaluated the critical conditions to predict short and medium-term performance of the uncemented anatomical Comprehensive® Total Shoulder System using a finite element model that was validated experimentally. Methods: The finite element models of an implanted shoulder analysed included total shoulder components with pegs. The models were simulated in 3 phases of adduction: 45°, 60° and 90° to determine the most critical situation. Two different bone-implant fixation conditions were considered: post-surgery and medium term (2 years). Results: These show that the critical condition is for the shoulder in 90° adduction were the highest contact stress (70 MPa) was observed in the glenoid component. Relatively to the interface implant-bone strains, the maximum (-16000 µε) was observed for the short-term in the lateral region of the humerus. The highest micromotions were observed in the central fixation post of the glenoid component, ranging from 20 to 25 µm, and 325 µm in the lateral plane of the humeral component. Conclusion: The predicted results are in accordance with clinical studies published and micromotions of the humeral component can be used to predict loosening and to differentiate shoulder implant designs.

N2  - Introduction: Musculoskeletal diagnostic ultrasound is an expanding clinical tool and increasingly used at point of care in clinical practice. Criticism around the accuracy of this modality is often attributed to operator dependence. This study evaluated the accuracy of a sonographer’s reporting against shoulder surgery. Methods: A musculoskeletal sonographer performed same-day ultrasound scans prior to elective shoulder surgery procedures. The sonographer was blinded to clinical history and previous investigations. A brief physical examination of resisted external rotation and resisted abduction strength was performed prior to scanning. Scan results were reported using British Elbow and Shoulder Society (BESS) reporting criteria. The sonographer attended surgery to gain immediate visual feedback. Sonographic reports and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports were graded (1= complete agreement; 2 = minor discrepancy unlikely to alter patient care; 3 = potentially significant discrepancy; 4 = definite, significant discrepancy) against surgical findings. The accuracy of sonographic reporting was correlated with patients’ body mass index (BMI). Results: Fifty-four cases were compared and correlations evaluated. Grade 1 (complete agreement) was reported 87.0% (n = 47), Grade 2 (minor discrepancy) 9.3% (n = 5) and Grade 3 (potentially significant discrepancy) 3.7% (n = 2). Sonographic reports closely correlated (Grade 1 or 2 scores) with surgical findings in 96% of cases. Conclusions: The musculoskeletal sonographic reporting had a high correlation with surgery findings. Ultrasound was more accurate than MRI in reporting full thickness rotator cuff tears. Clinical weakness in resisted external rotation or abduction did not correlate with imaging. Ultrasound was found to be unreliable in detecting rotator cuff tears in participants with a BMI ≥ 35.

N2  - Purpose: To biomechanically compare the dynamic double-sling with single-sling augmentation using the conjoined tendon (CT) with 20% of an anteroinferior glenoid bone defect under the high loads in shoulders. Methods: With the shoulder in 60° of glenohumeral abduction and 60° of external rotation, the 12 shoulders stability was tested sequentially in 5 conditions: intact, 20% glenoid bone loss, Bankart repair, single-sling augmentation with the CT, and double-sling augmentation with both the CT and long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT). The anteroinferior humeral head (HH) translation force of 20N, 30N, 40N, 50N, or 60N was applied to determine the shoulder stability in each condition. Results: The total HH translation over 8.77 mm represented the anteroinferior shoulder instability (95% confidence interval of bone defect: 7.76-8.77 mm). A significant increase in anteroinferior HH translation was demonstrated after the creation of 20% glenoid bone defect under the 20N translational force (10.52 ± 0.71 mm). Structural failure after the Bankart repair and the single-sling augmentation under the 30N (9.84 ± 1.25 mm) and 40N (9.59 ± 0.66 mm) translational forces, respectively, were observed. The double-sling augmentation effectively prevented the anteroinferior HH translation under the translational force of less than 40N, and only half of the augmentation structure (8.25 ± 1.66 mm) had failed under the 50N translational forces. Conclusion: In the absence of any Hill-Sachs lesion and when tested at 60° abduction and external rotation in shoulders with 20% glenoid bone defects, at time-zero, the double-sling augmentation strategy could effectively prevent anteroinferior translation when compared with the Bankart repair or the single-sling augmentation technique under all magnitudes of the translational force in biomechanical simulation. Nevertheless, none of the constructs restored the HH translation to the normal intact state. Clinical Relevance: Double-sling augmentation technique may represent a reliable option for preventing anteroinferior translation.

N2  - Accuracy of shoulder kinematics predicted by multi-body kinematics optimisation depend on the joint models used. This study assesses the influence of four different subject-specific gleno-humeral joint models within multi-body kinematics optimisation: a 6-degree-of-freedom joint (i.e. single-body kinematics optimisation), a sphere-on-sphere joint (with two spheres of different radii) and a spherical joint with or without penalised translation. To drive these models, the 3D coordinates of 12 skin markers of 6 subjects performing static arm abduction poses up to 180° were used. The reference data was obtained using biplane X-rays from which 3D bone reconstructions were generated: scapula and humerus were 3D reconstructed by fitting a template model made of geometrical primitives on the two bones’ X-rays. Without any motion capture system, the recording of the skin markers was performed at the very same time than the X-rays with radiopaque markers. The gleno-humeral displacements and angles, and scapula-thoracic angles were computed. The gleno-humeral sphere-on-sphere joint provided slightly better results than the spherical joint with or without penalised translation, but considerably better gleno-humeral displacements than the 6-DoF joint. Considering that it can easily be personalised from medical images, this sphere-on-sphere model seems promising for shoulder multi-body kinematics optimisation.

N2  - In vitro simulation of three-dimensional (3D) shoulder motion using in vivo kinematics obtained from human subjects allows investigation of clinical conditions in the context of physiologically relevant biomechanics. Herein, we present a framework for laboratory simulation of subject-specific kinematics that combines individual 3D scapular and humeral control in cadavers. The objectives were to: (1) robotically simulate seven healthy subject-specific 3D scapulothoracic and glenohumeral kinematic trajectories in six cadavers, (2) characterize system performance using kinematic orientation accuracy and repeatability, and muscle force repeatability metrics, and (3) analyze effects of input kinematics and cadaver specimen variability. Using an industrial robot to orient the scapula range of motion (ROM), errors with repeatability of ±0.1 mm and <0.5 deg were achieved. Using a custom robot and a trajectory prediction algorithm to orient the humerus relative to the scapula, orientation accuracy for glenohumeral elevation, plane of elevation, and axial rotation of <3 deg mean absolute error (MAE) was achieved. Kinematic accuracy was not affected by varying input kinematics or cadaver specimens. Muscle forces over five repeated setups showed variability typically <33% relative to the overall simulations. Varying cadaver specimens and subject-specific human motions showed effects on muscle forces, illustrating that the system was capable of differentiating changes in forces due to input conditions. The anterior and middle deltoid, specifically, showed notable variations in patterns across the ROM that were affected by subject-specific motion. This machine provides a platform for future laboratory studies to investigate shoulder biomechanics and consider the impacts of variable input kinematics from populations of interest, as they can significantly impact study outputs and resultant conclusions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Muscle synergies are defined as the central nervous system's organizational structure for movement. Muscle synergies change after muscular fatigue, with certain synergies assuming the primary role to compensate for fatigue within another muscle synergy. Owing to the high eccentric forces imposed upon the external rotators (ie, posterior rotator cuff), pitchers that continue to throw while fatigued are at a significantly higher risk of shoulder and/or elbow injury; however, the neuromuscular compensation strategies of baseball players in response to fatigue are currently unknown. HYPOTHESIS: Players would utilize the same muscle synergy structure following external rotation (ER) fatigue; however, muscle coefficients of nonfatigued muscles would increase (ie, compensate for the external rotators) after fatigue. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study conducted in a controlled, laboratory setting. METHODS: Nine players from an intercollegiate competitive club baseball team voluntarily participated in this study. Surface electromyography was used on 14 muscles of the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints of the dominant arm during a reaching protocol. Players completed a baseline reaching protocol (prefatigue), then an ER fatigue protocol until maximum concentric ER was reduced by 40%, and finally repeated the same reaching protocol (postfatigue). Principal component analysis was used to extract muscle synergies, the variance accounted for (VAF) of each synergy, and muscle coefficients. Prefatigue was compared with postfatigue using paired t tests for all dependent variables. RESULTS: Four muscle synergies were extracted for both pre- and postfatigue. The VAF for the ER/abduction synergy decreased significantly (prefatigue, 34.6%; postfatigue, 32.4%; P = 0.03), showing a decreased reliance on ER/abduction during the reaching task after fatigue. Within synergy 1, the pectoralis major muscle coefficient (-0.489 vs -0.552; P = 0.01; effect size = 1.68) decreased significantly from prefatigue to postfatigue, indicating that the pectoralis major assumed more of an antagonist role during ER/abduction. Within synergy 2 (forward reaching), there were no significant changes in VAF or muscle coefficients observed. For the third synergy, muscle coefficients increased for the serratus anterior (P = 0.02) and middle deltoid (P = 0.01), whereas in the fourth synergy, the pectoralis major (P = 0.01) increased and teres major (P = 0.01) and biceps brachii (P = 0.05) muscle coefficients decreased. CONCLUSION: The decreased VAF of the ER/abduction synergy after fatigue indicate that other muscles within that synergy could not fully compensate to maintain function. Interestingly, the changes in muscle coefficients suggest that players relied less on the internal rotation (IR) synergy and more on the cross-body synergy following fatigue. This may be due to imbalances between ER and IR while maintaining balance between cross-abduction and adduction. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clinicians may consider implementing low-load, high-repetition training programs to develop posterior shoulder endurance and prolong the onset of muscular fatigue.

N2  - PURPOSE: The study aims to retrospectively evaluate clinical and radiological outcomes and return to sport and to work of patients after arthroscopic Latarjet stabilization for primary instability or revision surgery; factors influencing and determining results, and potential predictors for clinical outcomes were also evaluated. METHODS: This is a retrospective study including patients aged greater than 18 years old who underwent arthroscopic Latarjet stabilization for recurrent anterior glenohumeral instability with off-track lesions, or for cases of recurrence after previous surgery, from 2011 to 2017. Patients were assessed preoperatively and at a minimum 3 years of follow-up using the Rowe score, the University of California at Los Angeles Shoulder Score and Simple Shoulder Test (SST) score; the range of motion, satisfaction rate, return to work and sport, perception of discomfort during sporting and daily activities, and complications and recurrence after surgery were also evaluated. The integration of the coracoid graft and the position of the screws were examined by CT scan. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up time of 6±2 years, 93 patients (95 shoulders) showed significant improvement of all scale scores (p<0.001), 97.8% of the patients had returned to the same working condition as before surgery, and all the patients who practiced sports preoperatively (85; 91.4%) returned to sport after surgery; 97.9% of patients were satisfied with surgery. The complication rate was 5.4%, and two cases (2.1%) of recurrence occurred, both after high-energy trauma. At an average of 17±13 months postoperatively, the CT scans showed four (6.6%) stable non-unions, 9 (14.8%) superior and 1 (1.6%) inferior lyses of the graft; a correct positioning of the graft was observed in 86.9% of the cases. Higher satisfaction, fewer complications, less pain during daily activities, and a lower number of reoperations were associated with a shorter time between the first dislocation episode and surgery (p=0.019, p<0.001, p=0.014, and p=0.005, respectively). Complications were directly associated with higher patient age at operation (p=0.001). A higher number of non-unions was found in patients with increased angle between the line linking the posterior and anterior glenoid rim and the screw axis (p=0.040) and a medial axial position or a lower coronal position of the graft (both p=0.010). A lower age at the time of surgery predicted better Rowe scores at follow-up (p<0.001), and a lower age at the time of the first episode of dislocation predicted better postoperative SST scores (p=0.026). CONCLUSIONS: At a mean 6-year follow-up time, excellent clinical outcomes, and radiological results, with few complications, high rates of satisfaction and return to work and sport and low sports anxiety can be expected after arthroscopic Latarjet procedure. A shorter time between the first dislocation episode and surgery was associated with higher satisfaction, fewer complications, less pain during daily activities and lower reoperations; a lower age at the operation was associated with lower complications.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical outcome and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings after arthroscopic Bankart repair with additional double anchor footprint fixation (DAFF) at the 4 o'clock position, where the native footprint is widest anatomically, for recurrent anterior shoulder instability. METHODS: Forty-two patients (mean age 27.0 years) with recurrent anterior shoulder instability and without severe glenoid bone defects underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with additional DAFF at the 4 o'clock position. Using three standard portals, single-row repair was performed at the 2, 3, and 5 o'clock positions, and DAFF with the suture bridging technique was conducted at the 4 o'clock position. MRI was performed preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively. Patients with follow-up periods of ≥1 year were included in the present study and clinically evaluated at the final follow-up. The morphology at the 2 and 4 o'clock positions on radial MRI slices was compared between the preoperative and 6-month postoperative scans, and the footprint of the repaired capsulolabral complex at 6 months postoperatively was compared between the 2 and 4 o'clock positions. RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 19.5 ± 6.2 months. The rates of dislocation recurrence and positive apprehension test results were 2.4 and 4.8%, respectively. External rotation was restricted by 3.5°. The University of California at Los Angeles and Rowe scores at the final follow-up were 34.5 ± 1.0 points and 97.2 ± 5.7 points, respectively, representing significant improvements over the preoperative scores (p < 0.01). Although the capsulolabral complex at 6 months postoperatively was firmly repaired at both the 2 and 4 o'clock positions compared to its preoperative state, the footprint of the restored capsulolabral complex was wider at the 4 o'clock position than at the 2 o'clock position (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Additional DAFF at the 4 o'clock position improved the glenohumeral stability and function of the shoulder joint. This study suggests that this technique is a reliable and useful treatment for shoulder instability.IV.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Upper quadrant geometrical changes in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) appear to have negative influences on geometrical arrangements of the thorax and scapula. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the impairment of scapular control in individuals with COPD as compared with healthy controls. METHODS: We systematically searched seven electronic databases from inception to June 2021 and updated the searches again in December 2021. Eligible studies included the participants with COPD and compared scapular control outcomes (scapular/shoulder kinematic or related muscle activity) with a control group. Two researchers independently searched for, screened, extracted data from, and evaluated the quality of all articles. RESULTS: Seven studies met the inclusion criteria and only five studies with 190 subjects were included in the meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses showed that the control group exhibited more scapular anterior tilt (SMD: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.90) and shoulder flexion (SMD: -1.02; 95% CI: -1.79 to -0.26) as compared with the COPD group. Conversely, the COPD group exhibited more scapular elevation (SMD: -1.03; 95% CI: -1.69 to -0.37), internal rotation (SMD: -1.65; 95% CI: -3.19 to -0.10), and protraction (SMD: -0.75; 95% CI: -1.18 to -0.32) compared with the control group. All other outcomes revealed non-significant findings. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrated scapular control impairments, such as scapular elevation, internal rotation, protraction, and anterior tilt in a static position in patients with COPD. To validate these findings, high-quality randomized control trials with large sample sizes and reliable outcome measures should be conducted.

N2  - BACKGROUND: An accurate estimation of the glenohumeral joint center of rotation (CoR) is important during alignment of braces and exoskeletons, as a misalignment will introduce undesired forces on the human body. The aim of this research was to develop a new method to estimate the glenohumeral CoR and register the location to the body using a single camera and two printed markers. METHODS: During shoulder anteflexion, the arm roughly describes an arc in the sagittal plane, with the glenohumeral joint in the center. Two binary square-fiducial ArUco markers were secured to the upper arm and the scapula, their position and orientation were obtained, and a sphere was fitted to the coordinates of the arm marker. The sphere center position was then registered on the skin. The accuracy was assessed with a test bench with a known rotational center. The repeatability was assessed in vivo with five healthy participants. RESULTS: The mean absolute offset between the true CoR of the test bench and the fitted sphere centers across multiple trials was 2.7 mm at a velocity of 30 degrees/s, and 2.5 mm at 60 degrees/s. The root mean squared distance from the estimated sphere centers after each trial to the mean sphere center across all trials per participant was 5.1 mm on average for the novice examiner and 5.2 mm for the expert examiner. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is able to accurately and precisely estimate the glenohumeral CoR.

N2  - Background: Glenoid cartilage defects may contribute to anterior shoulder instability recurrence and progression to osteoarthritis, but their morphology remains unknown. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose was to determine the shape, size, and location of glenoid cartilage defects and the prevalence and risk factors for cartilage defects in the setting of anterior glenohumeral instability. It was hypothesized that glenoid cartilage defects would be common, would be associated with recurrence of dislocation, and would share similar morphology with glenoid osseous defects. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: In this retrospective study, all patients who underwent arthroscopic surgical treatment for anterior glenohumeral instability between January 2012 and May 2019 were included; excluded were patients with documented posterior or multidirectional instability or previous glenohumeral surgery. For each patient, the operative report, arthroscopic images, and preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were reviewed to determine the prevalence of cartilage injury. For those patients with an Outerbridge grade 3 or 4 defect, the cartilage surfaces on the MRI scans were segmented to make 3-dimensional (3-D) segmentations. From these 3-D segmentations, we measured length, width, and surface area of the glenoid and defect, and the orientation of the defect relative to the superior and inferior poles of the glenoid. A multivariable analysis was conducted to determine correlates with cartilage damage. Results: In 322 patients treated operatively for anterior glenohumeral instability, 38% had a concomitant cartilage defect. The mean cartilage defect was located directly anteriorly at the 3:07 clockface position (range, 2:10-4:05) and encompassed 6.5% ± 3.5% of the glenoid surface area. However, defects ranged up to >56% of glenoid length and up to 27% of glenoid width, and the largest defect encompassed 19.5% of the glenoid cartilage surface area. Patients with a cartilage defect were more likely to be male (P =.031) and to have undergone a concomitant posterior labral repair (P =.018). Conclusion: Cartilage defects were common in patients with operatively treated anterior glenohumeral instability, occurring in 38% of patients. These defects were located directly anteriorly at 3:07, similar to osseous glenoid defects. Future prospective studies with cartilage-specific MRI sequences should be conducted.

N2  - Background: Evidence on the efficacy and safety of the free bone grafting in treating anterior shoulder instability is limited. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the clinical and imaging results of free bone grafting in treating anterior shoulder instability with glenoid bone defect and to explore the incidence of complications in clinically relevant subgroups. Methods: This systematic review was conducted per PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines. The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to January 29, 2021, for studies that had reported on free bone grafting in treating anterior shoulder instability with glenoid bone defect with a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Two researchers independently screened studies and extracted data. A random-effects model was used to pool data on clinical function scores, imaging results, and incidence of complications (recurrent instability and non–instability-related complications). Meta-regression analysis was used to evaluate the incidence of complications in different subgroups and investigate the sources of heterogeneity. Results: A total of 29 studies were included in the meta-analysis, comprising 840 patients (845 shoulders) with average ages ranging from 21 to 34.6 years. Compared with preoperatively, free bone grafting increased the postoperative Rowe score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Constant score, Subjective Shoulder Value, and Oxford Shoulder Instability Score by 53.16, 31.80, 20.81, 38.63, and 4.07 points, respectively, and reduced the visual analog scale pain score by 3 points on average. During the postoperative follow-up period, the rates of return to sport and return to preoperative levels were 84.2% and 73.1%, respectively. The imaging results showed that the free bone healing rate was 98.9% and the incidence of osteoarthritis was 10.9%. The incidence rates of recurrent instability and non–instability-related complications were 3.4% and 5.6%, respectively. Meta-regression analysis showed no evidence of effect modification by the year, follow-up time, proportion of male patients, autograft or allograft, and arthroscopy or open surgery on the incidence of complications. Subgroup analysis showed that the incidence rates of recurrent instability for open surgery, arthroscopy, allograft, autograft, Latarjet revision, and non–bone block revision were 4.1%, 2.3%, 1.5%, 4.4%, 10.3%, and 3.5%, respectively. Conclusion: The application of free bone grafting in treating anterior shoulder instability with glenoid bone defect can effectively improve shoulder joint function and is associated with a high return-to-sport rate and a low overall recurrence rate, but there were some differences in the complications of recurrent instability and non–instability-related complications among the subgroups. Given that these results need to be confirmed via head-to-head comparisons, we recommend that future clinical and biomechanical studies focus on comparing and investigating the advantages and disadvantages of different surgical approaches, thus providing a basis for orthopedic surgeons to make reliable choices.

N2  - Impairments in muscle activation have been linked to increased risk of developing shoulder pathologies such as subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) and associated rotator cuff injuries. Individuals with SIS have demonstrated increased upper trapezius (UT) muscle activation and reduced serratus anterior (SA) and lower trapezius (LT) muscle activation, which can be collectively represented as ratios (UT/SA and UT/LT). Targeted exercise is an important component of shoulder rehabilitation programs to re-establish optimal muscle activation and ratios. Electromyography (EMG) biofeedback during exercise has been shown to reduce UT activation and favorably alter scapular muscle activation ratios, however, a literature gap exists regarding the efficacy of other types of biofeedback. Therefore, we compared the effects of three types of biofeedback (visual EMG, auditory, verbal cues) on UT/SA and UT/LT ratios during a seated resisted scaption exercise in fifteen subjects without shoulder pain. Baseline muscle activation was recorded and compared to real-time muscle activation during each randomized biofeedback trial. All biofeedback types showed improvements in the UT/SA and UT/LT ratios, with visual EMG demonstrating a significant change in UT/LT ratio (p < 0.05). These results suggest that biofeedback could be utilized as a component of rehabilitation programs to prevent or treat shoulder pain.

N2  - Observable scapular dyskinesis is associated with biomechanical deficits. Preventative interventions aimed at correcting these deficits may aid in preventing the development and resolution of shoulder pain. Our purpose was to investigate the effects of kinesio taping (KT) on common biomechanical deficits associated with scapular dyskinesis and shoulder pain. Participants (n = 51) with observable scapular dyskinesis, and without shoulder pain were randomized to KT, KT-placebo, or a no-treatment control group. Measurements taken before, immediately after taping, and 3 days later included pectoralis minor muscle length, lower trapezius muscle strength, scapular upward rotation angle at 0° to 120° in scapular plane humeral elevation and acromiohumeral distance. There were no changes in scapular upward rotation, lower trapezius strength, and acromiohumeral distance immediately after taping or 3 days later compared to baseline (P > .05). The pectoralis minor increased in length in the KT group on day 3 compared to directly after taping (P = .03), but no difference between groups or interaction between time and group were determined (P > .05). Scapular dyskinesis prevalence did not change over time in any group (P > .05). In people with scapular dyskinesis free from shoulder pain, KT applied to the shoulder cannot be recommended to ameliorate the biomechanical deficits associated with shoulder pain.

N2  - Several tools have been used to assess muscular stiffness. Myotonometry stands out as an accessible, handheld, and easy to use tool. The purpose of this review was to summarize the psychometric properties and methodological considerations of myotonometry and its applicability in assessing scapular muscles. Myotonometry seems to be a reliable method to assess several muscles stiffness, as trapezius. This method has been demonstrated fair to moderate correlation with passive stiffness measured by shear wave elastography for several muscles, as well as with level of muscle contraction, pinch and muscle strength, Action Research Arm Test score and muscle or subcutaneous thickness. Myotonometry can detect scapular muscles stiffness differences between pre- and post-intervention in painful conditions and, sometimes, between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects.

N2  - Background: There remains no consensus regarding which repair technique provides the most optimal results for unstable distal clavicle fractures. Purpose: To compare radiologic and clinical outcomes between locking plate fixation and anatomic coracoclavicular (CC) ligament reconstruction for patients with unstable distal clavicle fractures. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: The study included 41 patients with Neer type 2B distal clavicle fracture. In group A (n = 15), patients were treated using CC ligament reconstruction with autologous palmaris longus tendon, artificial tape, and Steinmann pin fixation; in group B (n = 26), patients were treated using anatomic locking plate fixation. All patients had a minimum 2 years of follow-up. CC distance and arthrosis of the acromioclavicular joint were assessed radiographically. Clinical outcomes—including range of motion, visual analog scale for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons rating scale, and Constant score—were compared between the groups using the paired Student t test and Fisher exact test. Results: Bone union was attained in all patients. In both groups, the CC distance decreased significantly from presurgery to final follow-up: group A, from 16.25 ± 4.75 to 7.66 ± 2.61 mm (P <.001); group B, from 17.3 ± 4.07 to 9.33 ± 2.01 mm (P <.001). The final CC distance was significantly greater in group B (7.66 vs 9.33 mm in groups A and B, respectively; P =.028). Osteoarthritis of the acromioclavicular joint occurred in 13 of 41 patients (3 in group A and 10 in group B). At final follow-up, there was no statistical significance between the groups in range of motion, and clinical outcome scores were satisfactory in both groups, with no statistical difference between them. Conclusion: Anatomic locking plate and anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligament showed good clinical results, so both techniques can be considered reliable for restoring stability. However, CC ligament reconstruction had better CC distance on radiologic assessment and did not require removal surgery, so it may be the preferable surgical option to treat unstable distal clavicle fractures (Neer type 2B).

N2  - Background: Some studies have advocated the use of suture button fixation during Bristow-Latarjet surgery to reduce complications associated with screw fixation. However, data comparing these fixation methods are relatively incomplete. Purpose: To investigate the efficacy of modified arthroscopic Bristow-Latarjet surgery and compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes using screw versus suture button fixation. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: We evaluated 136 patients with traumatic anterior shoulder instability who underwent the modified arthroscopic Bristow-Latarjet surgery between June 2015 and February 2018. Of these patients, 117 who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled at a mean follow-up of 3.3 ± 0.7 years. Shoulders were separated into 2 groups based on fixation technique: screw fixation (group A; n = 63) or suture button fixation (group B; n = 54). Computed tomography imaging findings and clinical results were assessed preoperatively; immediately after operation; and postoperatively at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and final follow-up. Results: There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of postoperative clinical scores, the level of return to sports, range of motion, graft position, or reoperation rates. Bone healing was observed in 97.4% of the cases overall (114/117), with 98.4% bone union in group A and 96.3% in group B at final follow-up. Bone absorption was more common in group A (n = 30; 47.6%) compared with group B (n = 10; 18.5%) (P =.003). There were no hardware-related complications in group B, compared with 7.9% of patients in group A (P =.034). One patient in group B had a recurrent dislocation due to an unexpected event, and there were no recurrent dislocations in group A. Conclusion: After the modified arthroscopic Bristow-Latarjet procedure, both suture button and screw fixation methods demonstrated high bony healing rates and low risk of recurrence. Less coracoid graft resorption and no hardware-related complications were seen with suture button fixation.

N2  - Background: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) affects the length and moment arm of the deltoid and rotator cuff. Currently, RSA is commonly considered for cuff-intact conditions, such as primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis. As such, understanding the effect of contemporary lateralized designs on the rotator cuff is paramount. The purpose of this study was to determine changes in length and moment arm of the subscapularis, infraspinatus and teres minor with implantation of one of 3 RSA designs. Methods: A previously validated model was used in 6 hemi-toraces with the shoulder attached. Suture lines were run through pneumatic cylinders from the insertion to the origin of 10 muscles to apply a constant, stabilizing load. Electromagnetic tracking sensors were fixed to the thorax, scapula, and humerus to record 3-dimensional kinematics. Coordinate systems were established according to ISB recommendations. The origin and insertion of the subscapularis, infraspinatus and teres minor were digitized and tracked. Testing consisted of manually rotating the humerus through 5 cycles of its internal-external rotation arc. Kinematic data was collected at 120 Hz. Testing was performed in 3 positions of abduction: 0°, 30°, and 60°. After testing the intact shoulder, RSA was performed using 3 different configurations: an onlay 135-degree humeral component matched with a 2-mm lateralized glenosphere, the same humeral component with a 6-mm lateralized glenosphere, and an inlay 135-degree humeral component matched with a 10 mm lateralized glenosphere. Minimal muscle operative lengths, maximal muscle operative lengths, and muscle moment arms were computed. Results: When compared with the native shoulder, all 3 configurations of RSA resulted in statistically significant increases in both the minimal and maximal operative lengths of the subscapularis in all abduction positions. The teres minor only showed a statistically significant increase in minimal and maximal length at 60° of abduction. The infraspinatus showed a statistically significant increase in tendon excursion at 0° and 30° of abduction. In 40° of abduction and 40° of internal rotation, all RSA configurations translated in a decreased subscapularis internal rotation moment arm. On the contrary, RSA increased the external rotation moment arm of the infraspinatus in neutral rotation and 0° of abduction. Conclusion: Implantation of contemporary lateralized RSA implants led to increased length of the subscapularis to a greater extent than the increased length experienced by the infraspinatus and teres minor. The moment arm of the subscapularis decreased, whereas the moment arm of the teres minor in neutral rotation with the arm in abduction increased. Level of Evidence: Level III

N2  - Background: Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) primarily varies between 2 implant design options: a 135 humeral stem inclination that closely resembles anatomic orientation, versus the Grammont-style 155 humeral stem inclination that further medializes and distalizes the center of rotation (COR). The purpose of this study was to compare deltoid force, glenoid strain, and simulated glenohumeral range of motion (ROM) between RSA 135 and RSA 155 designs, with a series of standardized permutations of glenosphere offset and rotator cuff pathology. Methods: Twelve fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulder specimens were studied using a shoulder simulator. Native shoulder motion profiles for reproducible abduction range of motion were established using a customized testing device. Optical 3-dimensional tracking and pressure sensors were used to accurately record glenohumeral range of motion (ROM), deltoid force, and glenoid strain for RSA 135 and RSA 155 designs. For each cohort, all combinations of glenosphere offsets and rotator cuff tendon involvement were evaluated. Results: There was no significant difference in the overall abduction ROM between the 155 and the 135 humeral stem implants (P =.75). Resting abduction angle and maximum abduction angle were significantly greater with a 155 + STD (standard offset) construct than with a 135 + STD construct (P <.001 and P =.01, respectively). Both stem inclinations decreased combined deltoid force requirements as compared the native shoulder with a massive cuff tear. Effective glenoid strain did not vary significantly between 135 + STD and 155 + STD constructs (P =.66). Conclusion: Overall, range of motion between the 135 and the 155 humeral stem inclinations was not significantly different. The cumulative deltoid force was lower in RSA shoulders when compared to native shoulders with massive rotator cuff tears, highlighting the utility of both implant designs. The Grammont-style 155 stem coupled with a 2.5 mm inferior offset glenosphere required less deltoid force to reach maximum abduction than did the more anatomic, lateralized 135 stem coupled with a 4 mm lateral offset glenosphere.

N2  - Purpose of Review: The purpose of this review is to summarize recent literature regarding the latest design modifications and biomechanical evolutions of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty and their impact on postoperative outcomes. Recent findings: Over the past decade, worldwide implantation rates of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty have drastically increased for various shoulder pathologies. While Paul Grammont’s design principles first published in 1985 for reverse total shoulder arthroplasty remained unchanged, several adjustments were made to address postoperative clinical and biomechanical challenges such as implant glenoid loosening, scapular notching, or lim-ited range of motion in order to maximize functional outcomes and increase the longevity of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. However, the adequate and stable fixation of prosthetic components can be challenging, especially in massive osteoarthritis with concomitant bone loss. To overcome such issues, surgical navigation and patient-specific instruments may be a viable tool to improve accurate prosthetic component positioning. Nevertheless, larger clinical series on the accuracy and possible complications of this novel technique are still missing.

N2  - BackgroundComponent selection and placement in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) is still being debated. Recently, scapulothoracic orientation and posture have emerged as relevant factors when planning an RTSA. However, the degree to which those parameters may influence ROM and whether modifiable elements of implant configuration may be helpful in improving ROM among patients with different postures have not been thoroughly studied, and modeling them may be instructive.Questions/purposesUsing a dedicated expansion of a conventional preoperative planning software, we asked: (1) How is patient posture likely to influence simulated ROM after virtual RTSA implantation? (2) Do changes in implant configuration, such as humeral component inclination and retrotorsion, or glenoid component size and centricity improve the simulated ROM after virtual RTSA implantation in patients with different posture types?MethodsIn a computer laboratory study, available whole-torso CT scans of 30 patients (20 males and 10 females with a mean age of 65 ± 17 years) were analyzed to determine the posture type (Type A, upright posture, retracted scapulae; Type B, intermediate; Type C, kyphotic posture with protracted scapulae) based on the measured scapula internal rotation as previously described. The measurement of scapular internal rotation, which defines these posture types, was found to have a high intraclass correlation coefficient (0.87) in a previous study, suggesting reliability of the employed classification. Three shoulder surgeons each independently virtually implanted a short, curved, metaphyseal impaction stem RTSA in each patient using three-dimensional (3D) preoperative surgical planning software. Modifications based on the original component positioning were automatically generated, including different humeral component retrotorsion (0°, 20°, and 40° of anatomic and scapular internal rotation) and neck-shaft angle (135°, 145°, and 155°) as well as glenoid component configuration (36-mm concentric, 36-mm eccentric, and 42-mm concentric), resulting in 3720 different RTSA configurations. For each configuration, the maximum potential ROM in different planes was determined by the software, and the effect of different posture types was analyzed by comparing subgroups.ResultsIrrespective of the RTSA implant configuration, the posture types had a strong effect on the calculated ROM in all planes of motion, except for flexion. In particular, simulated ROM in patients with Type C compared with Type A posture demonstrated inferior adduction (median 5° [interquartile range -7° to 20°] versus 15° [IQR 7° to 22°]; p < 0.01), abduction (63° [IQR 48° to 78°] versus 72° [IQR 63° to 82°]; p < 0.01), extension (4° [IQR -8° to 12°] versus 19° [IQR 8° to 27°]; p < 0.01), and external rotation (7° [IQR -5° to 22°] versus 28° [IQR 13° to 39°]; p < 0.01). Lower retrotorsion and a higher neck-shaft angle of the humeral component as well as a small concentric glenosphere resulted in worse overall ROM in patients with Type C posture, with severe restriction of motion in adduction, extension, and external rotation to below 0°.ConclusionDifferent posture types affect the ROM after simulated RTSA implantation, regardless of implant configuration. An individualized choice of component configuration based on scapulothoracic orientation seems to attenuate the negative effects of posture Type B and C. Future studies on ROM after RTSA should consider patient posture and scapulothoracic orientation.Clinical RelevanceIn patients with Type C posture, higher retrotorsion, a lower neck-shaft angle, and a larger or inferior eccentric glenosphere seem to be advantageous.

N2  - The course of the spinal accessory nerve in the neck is long and superficial rendering it at high risk of injury during procedures performed in the posterior triangle. The majority of spinal accessory nerve injuries are iatrogenic in nature. This is associated with significant morbidity including reduction in shoulder movements, drooping of the shoulder, winging of the scapula and neuropathic pain. Knowledge of the nerve anatomy reduces the risk of intra-operative nerve injury. Traditional teaching describes the point of entry into the posterior triangle as the intersection between the upper and middle third of the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid. The aim of this study was to determine whether this is in fact the case and if so, whether this landmark can reliably be used to identify the spinal accessory nerve in order to improve patient outcomes. The spinal accessory nerve was identified unilaterally in 26 cadavers. The total length of sternocleidomastoid was measured as well as the length along the posterior border from the inferior aspect of the mastoid process to the point at which the accessory nerve enters the posterior triangle of the neck. These measurements were used to calculate the ratio of the entry point of the nerve into the posterior triangle along the length of the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid from its superior insertion point. The mean ratio was 0.35 with 95% confidence intervals of 0.33 to 0.36. Our findings confirm the traditional description of the entry point of the spinal accessory nerve into the posterior triangle of the neck. We describe a so-called 'safe zone' inferior to the midpoint of the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid within which the spinal accessory nerve is unlikely to be found, thereby reducing the risk of iatrogenic injury.

N2  - Background: The prevalence of findings on shoulder magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is high in asymptomatic athletes of overhead sports. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of atypical findings on MRI in shoulders of asymptomatic, elite-level climbers and to evaluate the association of these findings with clinical examination results. It was hypothesized that glenoid labrum, long head of the biceps tendon, and articular cartilage pathology would be present in >50% of asymptomatic athletes. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 50 elite climbers (age range, 20-60 years) without any symptoms of shoulder pain underwent bilateral shoulder examinations in addition to dedicated bilateral shoulder 3-T† MRI. Physical examinations were performed by orthopaedic sports medicine surgeons, while MRI scans were interpreted by 2 blinded board-certified radiologists to determine the prevalence of abnormalities of the articular cartilage, glenoid labrum, biceps tendon, rotator cuff, and acromioclavicular joint. Results: MRI evidence of tendinosis of the rotator cuff, subacromial bursitis, and long head of the biceps tendonitis was exceptionally common, at 80%, 79%, and 73%, respectively. Labral pathology was present in 69% of shoulders, with discrete labral tears identified in 56%. Articular cartilage changes were also common, with humeral pathology present in 57% of shoulders and glenoid pathology in 19% of shoulders. Climbers with labral tears identified in this study had significantly increased forward elevation compared with those without labral tears in both active (P =.026) and passive (P =.022) motion. Conclusion: The overall prevalence of intra-articular shoulder pathology detected by MRI in asymptomatic climbers was 80%, with 57% demonstrating varying degrees of glenohumeral articular cartilage damage. This high rate of arthritis differs significantly from prior published reports of other overhead sports athletes.

N2  - Introduction: The acromion marker cluster (AMC) is a non-invasive scapular motion tracking method. However, it lacks testing in clinical populations, where unique challenges may present. This investigation resolved the utility of the AMC approach in a compromised clinical population. Methods: The upper body of breast cancer survivors (BCS) and controls were tracked via motion capture and scapular landmarks palpated and recorded using a digitizer at static neutral to maximum elevation postures. The AMC tracked the scapula during dynamic maximum arm abduction. Both single (SC) and double calibration (DC) methods were applied to calculate scapular angles. The influences of calibration method, elevation, and group on mean and absolute error with two-way fixed ANOVAs with interactions (p < 0.05). Root mean square errors (RMSE) were calculated and compared. Results: DC improved AMC estimation of palpated scapular orientation over SC, especially at higher arm elevations; RMSE averaged 11° higher for SC than DC at maximum elevation, but the methods were only 2.2° different at 90° elevation. DC of the AMC yielded mean error values of ∼5–10°. These approximate errors reported for AMC with young, lean adults. Conclusions: The AMC with DC is a non-invasive method with acceptable error for measuring scapular motion of BCS and age-matched controls.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to establish consensus statements via a modified Delphi process on the Latarjet procedure, remplissage, and glenoid-bone grafting for anterior shoulder instability. Methods: A consensus process on the treatment utilizing a modified Delphi technique was conducted, with 65 shoulder surgeons from 14 countries across 5 continents participating. Experts were assigned to one of 9 working groups defined by specific subtopics of interest within anterior shoulder instability. Results: The technical approaches identified in the statements on the Latarjet procedure and glenoid bone-graft were that a subscapularis split approach should be utilized, and that it is unclear whether a capsular repair is routinely required. Furthermore, despite similar indications, glenoid bone-grafting may be preferred over the Latarjet in patients with bone-loss greater than can be treated with a coracoid graft, and in cases of surgeon preference, failed prior Latarjet or glenoid bone-grafting procedure, and epilepsy. In contrast, the primary indications for a remplissage procedure was either an off-track or engaging Hill-Sachs lesion without severe glenoid bone loss. Additionally, in contrast to the bone-block procedure, complications following remplissage are rare, and loss of shoulder external rotation can be minimized by performing the tenodesis via the safe-zone and not over medializing the fixation. Conclusion: Overall, 89% of statements reached unanimous or strong consensus. The statements that reached unanimous consensus were the prognostic factors that are important to consider in those undergoing a glenoid bone-grafting procedure including age, activity level, Hill-Sachs Lesion, extent of glenoid bone-loss, hyperlaxity, prior surgeries, and arthritic changes. Furthermore, there was unanimous agreement that it is unclear whether a capsular repair is routinely required with a glenoid bone graft, but it may be beneficial in some cases. There was no unanimous agreement on any aspect related to the Latarjet procedure or Remplissage. Level of Evidence: Level V, expert opinion.

N2  - CONTEXT: Volleyball players have shown to be at an increased risk of developing scapular dyskinesis. The kinetic chain exercise approach has gained a lot of attention because of its claims to provide an improved motor control and scapular kinematics. A form of cross exercise, known as mirror therapy, may enhance the effects of a kinetic chain exercise approach in throwing performance. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of mirror cross exercise (MCE), based on a kinetic chain exercise approach in the throwing performance of volleyball athletes with scapular dyskinesis. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Biomechanics laboratory. METHODS: 39 volleyball players with scapular dyskinesis were randomly allocated into 3 groups. The first group completed a 6-week kinetic chain approach (KCA group), the second group completed a kinetic chain exercise approach program in addition to MCE group, and the control group followed only their regular training program. Before and after delivering both interventions, throwing accuracy, speed, and force were determined while measuring the ground reaction forces of the drive leg during throwing. Two-way mixed analysis of variance investigated the effects of intervention and time and their interaction. RESULTS: The results showed intervention × time statistically significant interactions for throwing accuracy, speed, and force for the MCE and the KCA groups. Over the 6-week training period, the MCE and the KCA groups showed significant improvements in throwing accuracy (P < .01) and speed (P < .01), while the ground reaction forces did not change (P > .05). Throwing force increased significantly in the MCE group (P = .01). Between-group comparison showed statistically significant improvements in the throwing accuracy for the MCE and KCA groups against the control group (P < .01) at posttesting. The MCE demonstrated superior results over the KCA in the aforementioned measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the addition of MCE in a KCA program enhances energy transfer throughout the distal and proximal segments, thus improving kinetic chain recruitment and potentially preventing shoulder pathology.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Hybrid glenoid component fixation represents an emerging technology in TSA design. However, there is a paucity of larger-scale studies reporting the outcomes following implantation of these components. This study aimed to determine the outcomes following primary TSA utilizing hybrid glenoid component fixation with a central porous titanium post. METHODS: A retrospective review of two institutional databases identified patients ≥ 18 years who underwent a primary elective hybrid TSA between 2009 - 2018 with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up. Outcomes evaluated included visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, range of motion (ROM), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, complications, and implant survivorship free of reoperation or revision. Postoperative imaging was assessed for glenoid radiolucent lines and evidence of AGL. RESULTS: A total of 713 shoulders in 666 patients with a mean age of 61 ± 6 years and 50.9% men were included in the study at a mean follow-up period of 4.3 years (range 2.0 - 9.1 years). Notable clinical improvements were observed with respect to VAS pain (7.0 to 1.4; P < .001), active forward elevation (91° to 155°; P < .001), active external rotation (21° to 50°; P < .001), and ASES scores (38.6 to 82.7; P < .001) with all exceeding the substantial clinical benefit (SCB) threshold for TSA. Active internal rotation score also had significant improvement (3.1 to 5.7; P < .001). Glenoid radiolucent lines were identified in 57 (8.2%) TSA with 1 (0.1%) radiographically loose glenoid component. There were 54 (7.6%) complications with postoperative rotator cuff tear (n = 15; 2.1%) as the most common complication, and only 4 (0.6%) cases of glenoid related complications (AGL). Kaplan-Meier survival free from revision surgery was 98.7% at one year, 98.5% at two years, and 96.7% at five years. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid glenoid component fixation of anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty with a central porous titanium post demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in pain, range of motion, and ASES scores. Though AGL remains a concern, only 0.6% of TSA sustained glenoid related complications at a mean follow-up period of 4.3 years and survivorship free of revision was 96.7% at five years. These favorable clinical findings support the theoretical advantages of hybrid glenoid fixation, however large comparative investigations with long-term follow-up are needed to validate these results.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The role of the long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) in glenohumeral stability is not fully understood. Most objects are lifted in the sagittal plane with forward flexion, which stresses the posterior aspect of the unconstrained glenohumeral joint. Determining the mechanism by which the shoulder maintains stability with functional motions is important to understanding the pathoanatomy of degenerative shoulders. Our hypothesis was that the LHBT resists posterior translation of the humeral head (HH) during forward flexion by tensioning the posterior capsuloligamentous complex. METHODS: Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were tested using an established shoulder simulator which loads the LHBT, rotator cuff and deltoid tendons through a system of pulleys. A motion tracking system recorded glenohumeral translations with an accuracy of ±0.2mm. In each subject, the scapula was fixed and the humerus was tested in 6 positions: 30 and 60 degrees of glenohumeral forward flexion at i) maximum internal rotation (IR), ii) neutral rotation and iii) maximum external rotation (ER). The deltoid was loaded with 100N, and the infraspinatus and subscapularis were loaded with 22N each. The difference in glenohumeral translation was calculated at each position comparing the LHBT loaded with 45N or unloaded. RESULTS: At 30 degrees of glenohumeral forward flexion, unloading the LHBT increased humeral head (HH) posterior translation by 2.5mm (±0.9mm) (p<0.001), 1.7mm (±1.0mm) (p<0.001) and 1.0mm (±0.9mm) (p=0.01) at maximum ER, neutral rotation and maximum IR, respectively. At 60 degrees of glenohumeral forward flexion, unloading the LHBT increased HH posterior translation by 2.8mm (±1.2mm) (p<0.001), 2.4mm (±1.6mm) (p<0.001) and 1.7mm (±1.4mm) (p<0.001) at maximum ER, neutral rotation and maximum IR, respectively. CONCLUSION: LHBT loading resists posterior translation of the humeral head during forward flexion. This data supports the role of the LHBT as a posterior stabilizer of the shoulder, specifically when a person is carrying objects in front of them. Further work is needed to determine if unloading the LHBT, as is done with biceps tenotomy or tenodesis, may eventually lead to posterior labral pathology, or to the posterior glenoid wear commonly seen with osteoarthritis.

N2  - ABSTRACT: The authors sought correlations between harvesting of the scapular bone tip free flap used for head-and-neck reconstruction and any shoulder function deficit, particularly at the level of the rotator cuff. The flap permits reconstruction of large and diverse regions of the head and neck, but long-term harvest morbidity has not been investigated extensively. The authors analyzed the clinical records of all patients who underwent head-and-neck reconstructions using free scapular tip flaps in our department over the past 5 years. The inclusion criteria were complete clinical and radiological documentation and follow-up for at least 12 months. Two populations, a surgical and control population, were analyzed. All patients in both populations underwent the simple shoulder test, an internationally validated self-administered test that highlights functional shoulder deficits, and 3 additional tests at orthopedic visits: the external rotation test, Patte test, and external rotation lag sign test. A head-and-neck cancer-specific questionnaire (University of Washington Quality of Life, version 4) was completed by the surgical patients. All statistical analyses were performed using Software IBM SPSS Statistics (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).A total of 19 patients met the inclusion criteria: 11 males (57.8%) and 8 females (42.2%) of mean age 60.9 years (range 23-75 years). In addition, 20 age-and sex-matched volunteers with no history of shoulder pathology were evaluated in terms of shoulder functionality. The average score on the simple shoulder test was 10.55 in the healthy population versus 8.31 in the study population (P < 0.001); in particular, shoulder strength differed between the groups. Similarly, the orthopedic examinations revealed clinically significant differences between the controls and patients on the Patte test and external rotation lag sign test (both P < 0.001), but not the external rotation test (P > 0.001). The mean University of Washington Quality of Life was 73.39; most patients reported good quality of life (52.6%), followed by very good (15.7%).The free scapular bone tip flap is valuable for reconstruction of head-and-neck defects; the long and reliable vascular pedicle allows rapid patient mobilization. Morbidity was confined to small reductions in shoulder strength and external rotation, which do not affect quality of life.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Because of the irregular shape of the scapula and the different types of fractures, a standard internal fixation device is lacking in clinical practice, even though there are many options available. The study aimed to compare the therapeutic efficacy of titanium anatomical and reconstructive plates for extraarticular fractures of the scapula (Miller types IIb, IIc, and IV). METHODS: A retrospective study of 41 patients who underwent treatment for extraarticular fractures of the scapula between March 2017 and March 2020 was conducted. Patients were divided into two groups based on the fixation device, the titanium anatomical plate group (n=20 patients) and the titanium reconstructive plate group (n=21 patients). After follow-up for 12-18 months, the general characteristics, perioperative characteristics, postoperative follow-up findings, and imaging data of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The surgical procedures were uneventful in both groups. The anatomical plate group significantly outperformed the reconstructive plate group with respect to surgical duration and intraoperative blood loss (p < 0.001). At three-month postoperative follow-up, the Constant-Murley score (p = 0.026), shoulder flexion range of motion, and shoulder abduction range of motion in the anatomical plate group were all significantly more effective than those of the reconstructive plate group (p < 0.001). The postoperative WOSI scores of the two groups were similar. Imaging showed functional recovery and stable and reliable fixation in both groups. Time to bone union was similar in both groups (anatomical PLATE GROUP: 9.10 ± 1.25 weeks and reconstructive plate group: 9.24 ± 1.41, p=0.742). No complications occurred in all patients, such as fixation failure, instability or bone nonunion. CONCLUSION: Surgeons should favorably consider titanium anatomical plates for treatment of extraarticular scapula fractures due to their clear efficacy associated with shorter surgical time, less intraoperative blood loss, better fixation, and rapid short-term functional recovery.

N2  - Background: Scapular dyskinesis (SD) is a dysfunction associated with shoulder pathologies in overhead athletes and its classification is highly complex, especially in entry-level physical therapy students. Objective: This research aimed to determine the effect of a video training method on inter-rater reliability of physical therapy entry-level students with no clinical experience while performing SD ratings under 4-type, severity, and ‘yes or no’ criteria in overhead athletes. Methods: A total of 49 overhead athletes were evaluated by video recordings in posterior view of lifting tasks. Two entry-level students without clinical experience performed SD classifications according to previously mentioned criteria on both scapula in two separate sessions, with 1 week of difference. Data analysis was conducted based on the kappa coefficient (k) and its confidence intervals (CI). Results: The ‘yes or no’ criteria present better results than the 4-type and severity criteria. In addition, a better inter-rater agreement is evidenced in the second measurement compared to the first one. Furthermore, the k coefficients reach values like those achieved by experienced evaluators. Conclusion: Video training settings for scapular dyskinesis rating in entry-level physical therapist students with no clinical experience allows better inter-rater reliability values.

N2  - Hypothesis: The purpose was to report the short-term outcomes and survival of hemiarthroplasty with a pyrocarbon head (HA-PYC) for the treatment of shoulder osteoarthritis in patients aged ≤ 60 years. We hypothesized that HA-PYC could be an alternative to hemi-metal (avoiding the risk of rapid glenoid erosion) and total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) (avoiding the risk of rapid glenoid loosening) in an active patient population. Methods: Sixty-four consecutive patients (mean age, 53 years) who underwent HA-PYC for glenohumeral osteoarthritis were included. The primary outcome was revision to TSA or reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Secondary outcome measures included functional outcome scores; return to work and sports; and radiographic evaluation of humeral reconstruction quality using the “circle method” of Mears, as well as glenoid erosion severity and progression using the Sperling classification. Patients were reviewed and underwent radiography at an average follow-up of 33 months (range, 24-60 months). Results: At last follow-up, the rate of survival of the HA-PYC prosthesis was 92%. Revision was performed in 5 patients, with a mean delay of 24 months (range, 15-37 months): 1 conversion to TSA and 4 conversions to reverse shoulder arthroplasty. The Constant score and Subjective Shoulder Value increased from 36 points (range, 26-50 points) to 75 points (range, 69-81 points) and from 35% (range, 20%-50%) to 80% (range, 75%-90%), respectively (P < .001). Postoperatively, 91% of the patients (42 of 46) returned to work and 88% (15 of 17) returned to sport. The severity of preoperative and postoperative glenoid wear (Sperling grade 3 or 4) had no influence on the functional results. Patients who underwent associated concentric glenoid reaming (n = 23) had similar Constant scores and Subjective Shoulder Values (P = .95) to other patients and did not show more progression of glenoid wear. Nonanatomic reconstruction of the proximal humerus (center of rotation of the prosthesis > 3 mm from the anatomic center) occurred in 29% (18 of 62 patients) and was associated with significantly lower functional and subjective results, more complications (subscapularis insufficiency and/or symptomatic glenoid erosion), and a higher risk of revision. The additional 1.5-mm thickness of the metal disc under the pyrocarbon head was found to be the main reason for oversizing of the prosthetic head. Conclusion: HA-PYC is a reliable procedure to treat shoulder osteoarthritis and allows return to work and sports in a young (≤60 years) and active patient population. The severity of glenoid bone erosion or the association with glenoid reaming does not affect functional outcomes and failure risk. By contrast, nonanatomic reconstruction of the proximal humerus after HA-PYC (because of humeral head oversizing) occurred in one-third of the cases and is associated with lower functional outcomes, as well as higher risks of complications and revision.

N2  - Background: Treatment of posterior shoulder instability (PSI) associated with excessive glenoid retroversion is a rare, challenging problem in shoulder surgery. One proposed technique is posterior open wedge glenoid osteotomy to correct excessive glenoid retroversion as described by Scott. However, this operation is rarely performed, and limited long-term outcomes using this approach are available. The goal of this study was to analyze the long-term outcomes of posterior open wedge glenoid osteotomy for PSI associated with excessive glenoid retroversion. Methods: Six consecutive patients (7 shoulders) with a mean age of 24 years (range 19-34) were treated with posterior open wedge glenoid osteotomy for PSI associated with a glenoid retroversion greater than 15° and followed up clinically and radiographically at a mean age of 15 years (range 10-19). Results: Recurrent, symptomatic PSI was observed in 6 of 7 shoulders (86%). One necessitated revision with a posterior (iliac crest) bone block procedure and was rated as a failure and excluded from functional analysis. One patient rated his result as excellent, 3 as good, 1 as fair, and 1 as unsatisfactory. Mean relative Constant Score (CS%) was unchanged from preoperation to final follow-up (CS% = 72%) and pain did not significantly decrease (Constant Score = 7-10 points; P = .969). The mean Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV) improved postoperatively, but with 6 patients the improvement did not reach statistical significance (SSV = 42%-67%, P = .053) and the total Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index averaged 30% at the final follow-up. Mean glenoid retroversion of all 7 shoulders was corrected from 20° (range 16°-26°) to 3° (range −3° to +8°) (P = .018). In the 5 shoulders with preoperative static posterior subluxation of the humeral head, the humeral head was not recentered. All 7 shoulders showed progression of glenoid arthritic changes. Conclusions: Posterior open wedge glenoid osteotomy for PSI associated with excessive glenoid retroversion neither reliably restored shoulder stability nor recentered the joint or prevent progression of osteoarthritis. Alternative treatments for PSI associated with excessive glenoid retroversion have to be developed and evaluated.

N2  - Objective: To compare the diagnostic performance of direct magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) for labral lesions during conventional, abduction and external rotation (ABER), conventional plus abduction, and external rotation (ABER) positioning by using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Materials and methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed on the two main concepts of magnetic resonance arthrography: extremity position and labral lesions. Inclusion criteria consisted of original studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of MR arthrography in ABER and conventional position alone or combined for the diagnosis of labral lesions by using surgical findings as the reference standard. Meta-analyses were performed that compared MR arthrography during conventional positioning, ABER, and conventional plus ABER positioning. Results: Nine studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 733, 504, and 313 lesions assessed by conventional MRA, ABER MRA, and conventional plus ABER MRA, respectively, were included in our analysis. Pooled sensitivities of MRA in conventional, ABER, and conventional plus ABER position for labral tear diagnosis were 81.5%, 81.6%, and 95.7%, respectively. Pooled specificities of MRA in conventional, ABER, and conventional plus ABER position for labral tear diagnosis were 88.8%, 85.6%, and 94.5%, respectively. Summary receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated improved accuracy of conventional plus ABER MRA compared with conventional MRA or ABER MRA with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99, 0.90, and 0.88, respectively. Conclusion: Conventional plus ABER MRA showed increased diagnostic accuracy compared to both ABER MRA and conventional MRA alone in the diagnosis of labral lesions.

N2  - Purpose: Iatrogenic instability of the acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) following distal clavicle excision (DCE) represents an infrequent pathology. Revision surgery to restore ACJ stability and alleviate concomitant pain is challenging due to altered anatomic relationships. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the used salvage techniques and postoperative functional and radiological outcomes in retrospectively identify patients with a painful ACJ following DCE. We hypothesized that iatrogenic instability leads to ongoing impairment of shoulder function despite secondary surgical stabilization. Methods: 9 patients with a painful ACJ after DCE (6 men, 3 women, 43.3 ± 9.4 years) were followed up at a minimum of 36 months after revision surgery. Besides range of motion (ROM), strength and function were evaluated with validated evaluation tools including the Constant score and the DASH score (Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire), specific AC Score (SACS), Nottingham Clavicle Score (NCS), Taft score and Acromioclavicular Joint Instability Score (AJI). Additionally, postoperative X-rays were compared to the unaffected side, measuring the coracoclavicular (CC) and acromioclavicular (AC) distance. Results: At follow-up survey (55.8 ± 18.8 months) all patients but one demonstrated clinical ACJ stability after arthroscopically assisted anatomical ACJ reconstruction with an autologous hamstring graft. Reconstruction techniques were dependent on the direction of instability. The functional results demonstrated moderate shoulder and ACJ scores with a Constant Score of 77.3 ± 15.4, DASH-score of 51.2 ± 23.4, SACS 32.6 ± 23.8, NCS 77.8 ± 14.2, AJI 75 ± 14.7 points and Taft Score 7.6 ± 3.4 points. All patients stated they would undergo the revision surgery again. Mean postoperative CC-distance (8.3 ± 2.8 mm) did not differ significantly from the contralateral side (8.5 ± 1.6 mm) (p > 0,05). However, the mean AC distance was significantly greater with 16.5 ± 5.8 mm compared to the contralateral side (3.5 ± 1.9 mm) (p = 0.012). Conclusion: Symptomatic iatrogenic ACJ instability following DCE is rare. Arthroscopically assisted revision surgery with an autologous hamstring graft improved ACJ stability in eight out of nine cases (88.9%). However, the functional scores showed ongoing impairment of shoulder function and a relatively high overall complication rate (33.3%). Therefore, this study underlines the importance of precise preoperative indication and planning and, especially, the preservation of ACJ stability when performing AC joint resection procedures. Level of Evidence: Case series, LEVEL IV.

N2  - Posterior eccentric glenoid wear is associated with higher complication rates after shoulder arthroplasty. The recently reported association between the acromion shape and glenoid retroversion in both normal and osteoarthritic shoulders remains controversial. The three-dimensional coordinates of the angulus acromialis (AA) and acromioclavicular joint were examined in the scapular coordinate system. Four acromion angles were defined from these two acromion landmarks: the acromion posterior angle (APA), acromion tilt angle (ATA), acromion length angle (ALA), and acromion axial tilt angle (AXA). Shoulder computed tomography scans of 112 normal scapulae and 125 patients with primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis were analyzed with simple and stepwise multiple linear regressions between all morphological acromion parameters and glenoid retroversion. In normal scapulae, the glenoid retroversion angle was most strongly correlated with the posterior extension of the AA (R2 = 0.48, p < 0.0001), which can be conveniently characterized by the APA. Combining the APA with the ALA and ATA helped slightly improve the correlation (R2 = 0.55, p < 0.0001), but adding the AXA did not. In osteoarthritic scapulae, a critical APA > 15 degrees was found to best identify glenoids with a critical retroversion angle > 8 degrees. The APA is more strongly associated with the glenoid retroversion angle in normal than primary osteoarthritic scapulae.

N2  - Although shoulder kinematics have been analyzed by various methods, dynamic shoulder motion is difficult to track. This study aimed to validate the shoulder kinematic analysis using upright four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) and to compare the results with optical three-dimensional motion capture. During active elevation, bilateral shoulders of 10 healthy volunteers were tracked using 4DCT and motion capture. The scapulothoracic and glenohumeral rotations and the scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) at each position were calculated, and the differences between 4DCT and motion capture were compared. During 10−140° of humerothoracic elevation, the scapulothoracic joint showed upward rotation, internal rotation, and posterior tilting, and the glenohumeral joint showed elevation, external rotation, and anterior plane of elevation in both analyses. In scapulothoracic rotations, the mean differences between the two analyses were −2.6° in upward rotation, 13.9° in internal rotation, and 6.4° in posterior tilting, and became significant with humerothoracic elevation ≥110° in upward rotation, ≥50° in internal rotation, and ≥100° in posterior tilting. In glenohumeral rotations, the mean differences were 3.7° in elevation, 9.1° in internal rotation, and −8.8° in anterior plane of elevation, and became significant with humerothoracic elevation ≥110° in elevation, ≥90° in internal rotation, and ≥100° in anterior plane of elevation. The mean overall SHRs were 1.8 in 4DCT and 2.4 in motion capture, and the differences became significant with humerothoracic elevation ≥100°. The 4DCT analysis of in vivo shoulder kinematics using upright computed tomography scanner is feasible, but the values were different from those by skin-based analysis at the elevated arm positions.

N2  - Study Design: Observational, descriptive design. Background: Despite scapular mobility being essential for the completion of activities of daily living (ADLs), there is currently no established, a reliable goniometric technique to measure scapular protraction and retraction. A proposed method has shown clinically significant inter-rater reliability for a goniometric technique for these measurements. Purpose: This observational descriptive study examined the intra-rater reliability of a goniometric technique to assess scapular protraction and retraction among a sample of healthy adults. Methods: An occupational therapist who is a certified hand therapist (CHT) and an occupational therapy student used goniometry to measure the neutral (resting), protracted, and retracted positions of the right and left scapula for a sample of healthy young adults (n = 54; a total of 108 data points for each measurement). These measurements were compared to analyze intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. Results: For measurements of the scapula in neutral, protraction, and retraction, the standard error of measure (SEM) for repeat measures by the expert and novice raters was < 4.5° and < 3.9° respectively and ICC values ranged from poor to moderate (0.37-0.63). The SEM for measures between evaluators was < 5.0° and the ICC was poor (0.16-0.35). Minimum detectable change (MDC) values as a percentage of the mean (% MDC) ranged between 15.9 and 43.7% for intra-rater reliability and 21.9-52.8% for inter-rater reliability. Discussion: The results of the study were mixed; variance of less than 5° for repeat measures by the same rater and measures between raters suggest clinically acceptable reliability. However, variance as a proportion of available motion (%MDC) demonstrates a broader range both above and below the threshold of 30% suggested for rehabilitation assessments. Conclusion: There are few efficient, reliable techniques to measure scapular mobility in clinical practice. The absolute reliability of goniometry to measure scapular protraction and retraction is similar to measurements of other joints. However, additional research and possible refinement of the technique is recommended to further address relative reliability and validity.

N2  - IMPORTANCE: Scapular protraction and retraction are often essential for occupational performance; however, clinical assessment of these movements is uniquely challenging. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the interrater reliability of a novel goniometric method to measure scapular protraction and retraction. DESIGN: An observational, descriptive design was implemented to evaluate interrater reliability between two experienced occupational therapists who were also certified hand therapists. SETTING: Academic institution. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of graduate students (N = 80). Outcomes and Measures: The hypothesis, developed before study implementation, was that the technique would demonstrate clinically acceptable interrater reliability, defined as a standard error of measurement (SEM) <8°. Goniometric measurements of the scapula at rest, in maximal protraction, and in maximal retraction were independently obtained from each participant by each evaluator. The goniometer was aligned on the scapula using the superior angle as the axis of motion to measure the movement of the acromion relative to the frontal plane. The SEM was calculated in each position using the intraclass correlation coefficient values and the average of the standard deviations from the two raters. RESULTS: The SEM values between the two evaluators for the resting, protracted, and retracted positions were 3.46°, 2.93°, and 2.74°, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The SEM between the two evaluators for each scapular position was <4°, suggesting that the technique may be clinically reliable. However, additional research regarding the reliability and validity of the technique is recommended. What This Article Adds: The findings of this study support the use of goniometry to measure scapular protraction and retraction in relation to occupational performance. The technique provides a way to quantify baseline scapular mobility and track progress.

N2  - Background: It is unclear whether coracoacromial ligament release during the Latarjet procedure will increase superior translation of the shoulder joint. Purpose: To evaluate whether a modified suture button Latarjet procedure can decrease the acromiohumeral distance (AHD). Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted among 155 patients who underwent a modified suture button Latarjet procedure between 2013 and 2015. AHD was measured on bilateral computed tomography scans taken preoperatively and on scans of the affected shoulder taken on postoperative day 1 and postoperative month (POM) 6, POM 36, and POM 60. At each time point, we recorded pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) and objective shoulder function using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Rowe, and Walch-Duplay scores. Preoperative and final follow-up VAS and functional scores were compared using the paired t test. Pairwise comparison of AHD values at each follow-up time point were compared with the preoperative intact side using the paired t test. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility of the AHD measurements was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results: A total of 104 patients who met the criteria completed the final follow-up, which occurred at 62.6 ± 2.4 months (mean ± SD). When compared with presurgery, the VAS and all functional scores improved significantly at the last follow-up (P <.001 for all). Intra- and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients indicated good reliability for the ADH measurements. Preoperatively, there were no differences in AHD values between the intact and affected shoulders (7.8 ± 0.8 mm for both; P =.851). The AHD values at postoperative day 1 and POM 6, POM 36, and POM 60 were 9.6 ± 0.7 mm, 8.6 ± 0.9 mm, 8.0 ± 0.8 mm, and 7.9 ± 0.8 mm, respectively, all of which were larger than those of the preoperative intact side (P <.001 for all). Conclusion: The modified suture button Latarjet procedure not only offered satisfactory therapeutic effects but also did not decrease the AHD at 5-year follow-up.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the intra and interobserver reproducibility of a new goniometric method for evaluating the isolated passive range of motion of the glenohumeral joint in an outpatient setting. Methods: This is a prospective observational study on healthy subjects. The Glenohumeral ROM Assessment with Scapular Pinch (GRASP) method is a new method for assessing the isolated range of motion (ROM) of the glenohumeral joint (GH) by a single examiner with a clinical goniometer. It measures the isolated glenohumeral passive abduction (GH-AB), passive external rotation (GH-ER) and internal rotation (GH-IR) with the arm at 45º of abduction. These three GH ROM parameters were measured in both shoulders of 30 healthy volunteers (15 males/15 females, mean age:41.6[SD = 10.3] years). The full shoulder passive abduction, passive external rotation and internal rotation 45º of abduction were measured by the same examiners with a goniometer for comparison. One examiner made two evaluations and a second examiner made a third one. The primary outcome was the intra- and interobserver reproducibility of the measurements assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and the Bland–Altman plot. Results: The intra-observer ICC for isolated glenohumeral ROM were: 0.84 ± 0.07 for GH-ABD, 0.63 ± 0.09 for GH-ER, and 0.61 ± 0.14 for GH-IR. The inter-observer ICC for isolated glenohumeral ROM were: 0.86 ± 0.06 for GH-ABD, 0.68 ± 0.12 for GH-ER, and 0.62 ± 0.14 for GH-IR. These results were similar to those obtained for full shoulder ROM assessment with a goniometer. Conclusion: The GRASP method is reproducible for quick assessment of isolated glenohumeral ROM. Level of evidence: III

N2  - Background: Kinematic analysis of the 3D reach-to-grasp drinking task is recommended in stroke rehabilitation research. The number of trials required to reach performance stability, as an important aspect of reliability, has not been investigated for this task. Thus, the aims of this study were to determine the number of trials needed for the drinking task to reach within-session performance stability and to investigate trends in performance over a set of trials in non-disabled people and in a sample of individuals with chronic stroke. In addition, the between-sessions test–retest reliability in persons with stroke was established. Methods: The drinking task was performed at least 10 times, following a standardized protocol, in 44 non-disabled and 8 post-stroke individuals. A marker-based motion capture system registered arm and trunk movements during 5 pre-defined phases of the drinking task. Intra class correlation statistics were used to determine the number of trials needed to reach performance stability as well as to establish test–retest reliability. Systematic within-session trends over multiple trials were analyzed with a paired t-test. Results: For most of the kinematic variables 2 to 3 trials were needed to reach good performance stability in both investigated groups. More trials were needed for movement times in reaching and returning phase, movement smoothness, time to peak velocity and inter-joint-coordination. A small but significant trend of improvement in movement time over multiple trials was demonstrated in the non-disabled group, but not in the stroke group. A mean of 3 trials was sufficient to reach good to excellent test–retest reliability for most of the kinematic variables in the stroke sample. Conclusions: This is the first study that determines the number of trials needed for good performance stability (non-disabled and stroke) and test–retest reliability (stroke) for temporal, endpoint and angular metrics of the drinking task. For most kinematic variables, 3–5 trials are sufficient to reach good reliability. This knowledge can be used to guide future kinematic studies.

N2  - Background: Unilateral resistance training increases the strength of the contralateral non-trained homologous muscles known as the cross-education effect. We tested the hypothesis that unilateral eccentric resistance training (ET) would induce greater and longer-lasting cross-education effect when compared with concentric resistance training (CT). Methods: Young (20–23 y) participants were allocated to ET (5 males, 4 females) or CT (5 males, 4 females) group that performed unilateral progressive ET or CT of the elbow flexors, twice a week for 5 weeks (10 sessions) followed by a 5-week detraining, and control group (7 males, 6 females) that did not perform any training. Maximum voluntary isometric contraction torque of the elbow flexors (MVIC), one-repetition maximum of concentric dumbbell curl (1-RM), and biceps brachii and brachialis muscle thickness (MT) were measured from the trained and non-trained arms before, several days after the last training session, and 5 weeks later. A ratio between the trained and non-trained arms for the change in MVIC or 1-RM from pre- to post-training (cross-body transfer ratio) was compared between ET and CT groups. Results: The control group did not show significant changes in any variables. Both ET and CT increased (P < 0.05) MVIC (22.5 ± 12.3 % vs. 26.0 ± 11.9 %) and 1-RM (28.8 ± 6.6 % vs. 35.4 ± 12.9 %) of the trained arm without a significant difference between groups. MVIC was maintained after detraining for ET but returned to the baseline for CT, and 1-RM was maintained after detraining for both ET and CT. For the non-trained arm, MVIC (22.7 ± 17.9 % vs. 12.2 ± 10.2 %) and 1-RM (19.9 ± 14.6 % vs. 24.0 ± 10.6 %) increased similarly (P > 0.05) after ET and CT, and MVIC returned to the baseline after detraining, but 1-RM was maintained for both groups. An increase (P < 0.05) in MT was found only after ET for the trained arm (7.1 ± 6.1 %). The cross-body transfer ratio for MVIC was greater (P < 0.05) for ET (90.9 ± 46.7 %) than CT (49.0 ± 30.0 %). Conclusions: These results did not support the hypothesis and showed similar changes in the most of the variables between ET and CT for the trained and non-trained arms, and strong cross-education effects on MVIC and 1-RM, but less detraining effect after ET than CT on MVIC of the trained arm.

N2  - Purpose: Based on its close anatomic features and nearly-collinear force vector to those of supraspinatus muscle, the current article describes a technique of middle trapezius tendon transfer for reproduction of supraspinatus function in the context of rotator cuff irreparability/re-tear management. Methods: While seating the patient in beach-chair position, arthroscopic gleno-humeral examination and sub-acromial decompression are initially performed. Hamstring tendons are harvested and fashioned as flattened quadruple sheet. Through McKenzie approach, infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons are repaired. Then, medial half of middle trapezius insertion tendon is harvested from most medial 5-6 cm of the scapular spine. Through McKenzie approach, hamstring sheet is retrieved via a sub-trapezius/sub-acromial corridor from the scapular wound. Hamstring sheet is re-attached to cuff footprint by double row/suture bridge repair configuration. While retracting the scapula and placing gleno-humeral joint in 45O-abduction/45O-external rotation, hamstring sheet is re-attached to released middle trapezius tendon by non-absorbable sutures. Finally, tendon reconstruct is dynamically-tested in different positions of range of motion. Results: Transfer of medial portion of middle trapezius insertion tendon (lengthened by interposition hamstring tendon sheet) to cuff footprint was technically feasible. Dynamic testing showed smooth sub-acromial gliding motion of the tendon reconstruct. Conclusion: For reproduction of supraspinatus function, hamstring tendon augmented-middle trapezius tendon transfer to cuff footprint heralds a number of technical and biomechanical advantages; thus offering a potential effective modality of cuff irreparability/re-tear management in relatively young patients of high functional demands. However, current description should be investigated in further biomechanical and clinical studies to validate its long-term outcomes.

N2  - Background: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatologic disease that occurs in the pediatric population. Often, JIA continues throughout life, leading to progressive polyarticular arthritis and significant joint destruction and disability, oftentimes requiring replacement surgery. This study aimed to determine the outcomes of primary shoulder arthroplasty (SA) in patients with JIA. Methods: Over a 42-year time period (1977-2019), 67 primary SA (20 hemiarthroplasty [HA], 38 anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty [TSA], and 9 reverse shoulder arthroplasty [RSA]) with a prior diagnosis of JIA formally established in a multidisciplinary rheumatologic clinic met inclusion criteria. Further assessment was performed with inclusion of the visual analog scale pain score, active shoulder range of motion (ROM), imaging studies, complications, and implant survivorship free from reoperation and revision. Results: SA led to substantial improvements in pain and ROM across the entire cohort at an average follow-up period of 12.2 years (range, 2-34 years). TSA was associated with the lowest pain scores (0.8; P = .02) and the highest American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form scores (77.4; P = .04) at the most recent follow-up when compared to HA and RSA. There were 14 (21%) complications across the cohort with rotator cuff failure (n = 4; 5.9%) as the most common complication followed by infection (n = 3; 4.5%). Revision surgery was performed in 5 shoulders (7.5%), with 5-year implant survival rates of 95.1% at 5 years, 93% at 10 years, 89.4% at 20 years, and 79.5% at 30 years. At 30 years, TSA was associated with better survival (90.1%) than HA (71.8%). Conclusions: Primary shoulder arthroplasty in the form of HA, TSA, and RSA offers a reliable surgical option for JIA patients with respect to pain reduction and ROM improvements. Unique challenges still exist in this cohort, in particular younger patients with an elevated propensity for glenoid bone erosion and a complication rate of 20.9%. As such, HA may not be ideal in this patient population. However, despite rotator cuff and glenoid concerns, TSA seems to be associated with better pain relief and patient-reported outcomes with the most durability in the long term when compared to HA.

N2  - Introduction: Latarjet coracoid bone block is an effective treatment for the management of recurrent anterior shoulder instability. Minimally invasive technique modified by Saragaglia helps in preservation of subscapularis, leaves a minimal scar and helps in early rehabilitation and recovery. Aim: To assess the midterm clinical outcome of minimally invasive Latarjet procedure. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective cohort study in which patients above 20 years of age of either sex with instability severity score index of >6 were included. A detailed history and clinical examination was done with special reference to hand dominance and number of episodes. Special tests like shift and load test, sulcus test, anterior apprehension test shoulder anterior drawer test and Jobe's relocation test were done and found to be positive. Preoperative Rowe score was assessed in all the patients. Mean follow-up in present study was 60±18 months. Quantitative variables were analysed using student's t-test and qualitative variables using Fischer's-exact test or Chi-square. A p-value of <0.05 was considered as significant. Results: There were 40 men and seven female patients (49 shoulders, two patients with bilateral pathology) with an average age of 33.5±9 years (range 23-55). No recurrent dislocation was reported in the study. None of the patients had a positive apprehension test at final follow-up. Rowe score at final followup was excellent in 39 (79%) patients, good in 7 (15%) patients, fair in 3 (6%) patients and no patient reported poor result (score below 50). All special tests like shift and load test, sulcus test, anterior apprehension test, shoulder anterior drawer test and Jobe's relocation test became negative at final follow-up. Three patients developed superficial infection and one patient developed pseudoarthrosis of the graft. Conclusion: Minimally invasive Latarjet procedure is simple, easy and reproducible method of treating anterior shoulder instability. It provides good cosmesis and functional results with low recurrence rate at a midterm follow-up.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the sensorimotor and clinical function of patients with confirmed successful outcome after either undergoing acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) stabilization, Bankart repair (BR), or rotator cuff repair (RC), and to compare these measures to the contralateral, healthy side without history of previous injuries or surgeries of the upper extremity. It was hypothesized that patients of each interventional group would have inferior sensorimotor function of the shoulder joint compared to the contralateral, healthy side, while presenting with successful clinical and functional outcomes. METHODS: Three intervention groups including ten patients who had confirmed successful clinical and functional outcomes after either undergoing ACJ stabilization, BR, or RC were evaluated postoperatively at an average follow-up of 31.7 ± 11.6 months. Additionally, a healthy control group (CG) of ten patients was included. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Constant-Murley (CM) and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Score. Pain was evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Sensorimotor function was assessed by determining the center of pressure (COP) of the shoulder joint in a one-handed support task in supine position on a validated pressure plate. RESULTS: Each interventional group demonstrated excellent clinical outcome scores including the CM Score (ACJ 83.3 ± 11.8; BR 89.0 ± 10.3; RC 81.4 ± 8.8), ASES Score (ACJ 95.5 ± 7.0; BR 92.5 ± 9.6; RC 96.5 ± 5.2), and VAS (ACJ 0.5 ± 0.9; BR 0.5 ± 0.8; RC 0.5 ± 0.8). Overall, the CG showed no significant side-to-side difference in COP, whereas the ACJ-group and the BR-group demonstrated significantly increased COP compared to the healthy side (ACJ 103 cm vs. 98 cm, p = 0.049; BR: 116 cm vs. 102 cm, p = 0.006). The RC-group revealed no significant side-to-side difference (120 cm vs. 108 cm, n.s.). CONCLUSION: Centre of pressure measurement detected sensorimotor functional deficits following surgical treatment of the shoulder joint in patients with confirmed successful clinical and functional outcomes. This may indicate that specific postoperative training and rehabilitation protocols should be established for patients who underwent surgery of the upper extremity. These results underline that sensorimotor training should be an important component of postoperative rehabilitation and physiotherapeutic activities to improve postoperative function and joint control.IV.

N2  - Background: Improvement in internal rotation (IR) is not reliably achieved after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between postoperative IR and glenoid-sided lateralization following RSA in an implant using metallic lateralization. Methods: A multicenter retrospective study of RSAs with minimum 1-year clinical follow-up was performed. Patients were stratified based on the amount of glenoid-sided implant lateralization into 4 groups: 0-2 mm (n = 57), 4 mm (n =238), 6 mm (n = 95), and 8 mm (n = 65). The primary study outcome was active IR at a minimum of 1 year postoperatively, measured both by spinal level and in degrees with the shoulder abducted to 90°. Secondary outcomes were active forward flexion and external rotation, belly press strength, and subjective patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Comparisons were made with 1-way analyses of variance. Linear regression analyses evaluating for the association of glenoid lateralization with active IR were also performed to control for additional confounders, including demographics and other implant variables such as glenosphere diameter, humeral lateralization, humeral version, and whether the subscapularis was repaired. Results: A total of 455 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 69 years, and 48% of patients were male. IR differences varied by the method of measurement (spinal level vs. IR in degrees with arm abducted). Overall, patients with 8 mm of glenoid lateralization had significantly improved IR compared with all other lateralization groups. Patients with 6 mm of glenoid lateralization had significantly improved IR compared with the 0-2- and 4-mm groups. There were no significant differences in the secondary outcomes or PROs between lateralization groups. In the regression analysis, glenoid lateralization was the only implant-related variable that was significantly associated with improved IR for both measurement methods. Glenosphere diameter and humeral version were both significantly associated with IR measured in degrees with the arm abducted but not spinal level. Conclusions: For the studied implant system, glenoid lateralization of 6-8 mm was associated with improved active IR at 1 year compared to patients with less glenoid lateralization with no significant differences in active forward flexion, external rotation, or PROs. In a multivariable analysis, increased humeral retroversion was associated with increased IR at 90° and increasing glenosphere diameter was associated with decreased IR at 90°, whereas BMI, subscapularis repair, and humeral lateralization did not significantly affect active IR.

N2  - Background: Controversy exists regarding the biomechanical and clinical effects of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) in shoulders with an intact versus a torn rotator cuff (RC). We compared clinical and radiographic outcomes at a minimum of 2 years after RTSA for cuff-intact or cuff-deficient conditions. Methods: Retrospective review identified 182 patients with at least 2 years of follow-up: 32 with an intact rotator cuff but advanced glenoid bone loss and 150 with a torn rotator cuff. Revision arthroplasties and those for osteonecrosis or trauma were excluded, and a matched cohort was created to compare 32 cuff-intact to 32 cuff-deficient shoulders. Assessments included preoperative and postoperative visual analog pain scores (VAS), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores, narcotic use, strength, range of motion (ROM), complications, and revisions. Radiographs were analyzed for signs of loosening or mechanical failure. Results: Mean age for all patients was 71.7 (61-82) years, and the mean follow-up was 2.7 (2.0-5.5) years. Preoperatively, the groups were similar in almost every functional preoperative category, with no differences in gender, laterality, age, preoperative narcotic use, body mass index, or other co-morbidities. Postoperatively, no significant differences were found regarding VAS pain, ASES, ROM, strength, complication rate, revision rate, narcotic use, implant loosening, or mechanical failure; both groups showed significant improvements in all categories measured. Conclusions: RTSA provides reliably good functional and radiographic outcomes with low complication rates in indicated patients, regardless of the preoperative status of the rotator cuff. Level of evidence: Level III; Retrospective Comparative Study

N2  - Introduction: Implantation of a reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) impacts deltoid length, shape and tension. Quantification of changes in deltoid muscle tension with implantation of RSA has remained elusive. The purpose of this study was to use shear wave elastography (SWE) to quantify deltoid muscle stiffness preoperatively, intraoperatively and postoperatively in patients undergoing RSA. Methods: Twenty patients scheduled to undergo RSA (ReUnion, Stryker) were prospectively enrolled in this study. A single observer trained in SWE quantified deltoid stiffness preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively. Clinical evaluation included pain, motion, quickDASH, ASES, Oxford, and subjective shoulder value scores. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs were measured by an independent observer to determine the lateralization and distalization shoulder angles (LSA and DSA). A statistical analysis was then performed to determine whether changes in deltoid muscle stiffness correlated with any of these parameters. Results: Implantation of a RSA lead to an increase SWE deltoid stiffness value from 22.4 ± 4.2 kPa preoperatively to 29.9 ± 5.23 kPa (P .0001) immediately after surgery, and 26.6 ± 6.6kPa (P= .03) at most recent follow-up. Preoperative SWE deltoid stiffness values did not differ when measured in the office or under anesthesia. Reverse arthroplasty did not significantly change the LSA (P= .051), but did increase the DSA (P< .0001). Greater SWE deltoid stiffness values correlated with better active elevation (P= .0128) better external rotation (P= .0247), and larger DSA (P= .0026). Elevation and external rotation showed a positive correlation with the DSA and a negative correlation with the LSA. Conclusion: After implantation of one RSA design incorporating glenoid and humeral lateralization, deltoid stiffness as measured with SWE increased significantly. Deltoid stiffness seems to correlate with joint distalization, elevation and external rotation. SWE seems to be reliable to quantify deltoid stiffness after reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Level of Evidence: Level IV; Diagnostic Study

N2  - Background: Latarjet coracoid transfer reconstruction is the gold standard for the treatment of recurrent shoulder instability with anterior-inferior glenoid bone loss, and return to sport is often a primary outcome of interest in this patient population. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of return to sport in patients undergoing the Latarjet procedure and variables that are associated with a higher likelihood of a successful return to sport. Methods: A prospectively maintained institutional registry was retrospectively queried between August 2012 and August 2016 for all patients who underwent the Latarjet procedure. Patients were contacted electronically and via telephone to administer a previously validated and standardized return-to-sport survey. Patients self-reported return to sport, varying sports participation, recurrence of instability, and time to return to sport. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine variables associated with each outcome. Results: Of 83 patients, 66 (75.3%) were available for final follow-up, of whom 60 participated in sports prior to surgery and were eligible for inclusion. The average follow-up period was 53.8 ± 11.8 months. The average age at surgery was 26.7 ± 11.3 years, and the average body mass index was 26.2 ± 4.0 kg/m2. There were 54 patients (90%) who were able to return to sport at an average of 8.6 ± 4.1 months following surgery. In total, 36 patients (60%) were able to return to sport at the same level or a better level of intensity, 19 of 28 patients (67.9%) were able to return to throwing sports without difficulty, and 31 of 60 patients (51.7%) reported that their shoulder was a hindrance to some activity. An increased likelihood of returning to sport was associated with increased body mass index (P = .016), male sex (P = .028), and decreased humeral bone loss volume (P = .034). An increased likelihood of returning to sport at the same level or a better level of intensity was associated with reduced humeral bone loss volume (P = .026). Recurrent instability was associated with humeral bone loss (P = .038). Conclusion: Although a large majority of patients were able to return to sport following the Latarjet procedure, some patients experienced limitation with throwing and return to sport at the preinjury level. Greater humeral bone loss was associated with inferior outcomes. These findings should be discussed with patients in the preoperative setting to manage expectations appropriately.

N2  - Background: The implantation rates of reverse total shoulder arthroplasties (RTSAs) are increasing worldwide, resulting in higher absolute numbers of the associated complications and revision surgeries. This requires the discussion of salvage therapies for failed RTSAs without revision to a new RTSA. Revision to hemiarthroplasty may offer a valid fallback option in certain cases. This study aimed to analyze the incidence, indications, and clinical outcomes, especially the reduction in pain levels compared to a matched control group. Methods: Our prospectively enrolled patient cohort of RTSA implantations at a tertiary referral center between January 2005 and December 2018 was retrospectively queried for revision to a hemiarthroplasty. For clinical outcome evaluation, a minimum follow-up duration of 2 years after revision to hemiarthroplasty was required. Clinical outcome measures were compared to two matching groups, one with RTSA preserving revision and one without any reintervention. The outcome measures were the absolute and relative Constant-Murley score (aCS and rCS), Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV), range of motion, and pain. Results: A total of 21 out of 1237 RTSAs (1.7%) underwent salvage revision to hemiarthroplasty at a mean time of 20 ± 21 months (range, 1-75 months). Of those, 12 were available for a minimum follow-up of 2 years after revision to a hemiarthroplasty. The main indications were glenoid loosening (8/12), scapular spine fracture (2/12), and instability (2/21). Clinical outcome was analyzed at a mean follow-up period of 46 ± 26 months (24 months to 123 months) after revision to a hemiarthroplasty. The revision significantly reduced CS pain from 6 ± 4 points to 12 ± 3 points (scale 0 to 15 with 15 as optimum, P <.01). The aCS, rCS, SSV, and range of motion did not improve. Comparison with the RTSA preserving revision group and the RTSA group without reintervention showed significantly worse outcome scores for aCS (33 ± 10 vs. 55 ± 19 vs. 69 ± 12 points), rCS (41 ± 14% vs. 67 ± 20% vs. 84 ± 13%), SSV (35 ± 19% vs. 64 ± 20% vs. 81 ± 15%), flexion (53 ± 27° vs. 64 ± 20° vs. 128 ± 24°), and abduction (50 ± 23° vs. 109 ± 42° vs. 142 ± 24°). Pain was similar in all groups at the last follow-up visit. Conclusion: In a few cases, RTSA retention or revision to another RTSA is impossible. For those patients, conversion to hemiarthroplasty is a valid fallback option to reduce the patient's pain levels and provide low-level function.

N2  - Background: Despite the success of reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA), complication rates remain high (13% to 25%), due to instability, infection, and glenoid component loosening, which can lead to revision. The aim of the present study was to report the early clinical outcomes of RSA using a new hybrid baseplate design, in comparison with the literature on other common RSA baseplates. Methods: The authors retrospectively analyzed the records of 142 patients (142 shoulders) who underwent primary RSA using a hybrid baseplate design by the senior surgeons between May 2014 and December 2018. Preoperative and postoperative assessments included the Constant score (CS) and range of motion, including active forward elevation, external rotation, and internal rotation. Results: Of the initial cohort of 142 patients, 13 were lost to follow-up (8.6%), 2 died (1.3%), and 8 required reoperations with implant removal (5.3%). The remaining 119 patients comprised 71 women (60%) and 48 men (40%), aged 73.6 ± 7.3 years at index surgery, 43 of whom required bony increased offset (36%). At a minimum follow-up of 2 years, the CS improved by 37.3 ± 16.1, active forward elevation increased by 51.2° ± 38.1°, external rotation increased by 16.4° ± 25.0°, and internal rotation increased by 1.5 ± 3.2. Conclusion: At a minimum follow-up of 2 years after RSA using a new hybrid baseplate system, the CS and range of motion were satisfactory and comparable to those in recent systematic reviews. The findings of this study suggest that this hybrid baseplate system provides satisfactory outcomes in the short term, although longer follow-up studies are needed to validate its long-term efficacy.

N2  - Transverse glenoid fractures with a cranial coracoglenoidal fragment (Ideberg type III) can lead to detrimental post-traumatic sequelae. Open surgery requires an extensive surgical approach. Arthroscopic procedures are highly challenging with respect to both fracture reduction and screw osteosynthesis. We present a reproducible arthroscopic technique for a dislocated transverse glenoid fracture using 5 standard portals. Grasping the coracoid with a small, serrated reduction clamp through the anterior portal allows simple and sufficient reduction. Safe screw osteosynthesis can then be performed from cranially without the need to create a Neviaser portal.

N2  - Open transosseous repair was historically considered the gold-standard surgical solution for rotator cuff tears; however, with advancements in arthroscopic surgery, this procedure was largely replaced by anchor-based techniques. Yet, the ability of anchor-based techniques to achieve similar biomechanical fixation remains uncertain. In this article, we describe a reproducible, economical, arthroscopic anchorless transosseous rotator cuff repair technique that uses an Omega configuration. This technique involves two bone tunnels and four high-strength polyethylene sutures and is suitable for medium-to-large rotator cuff tears that would alternatively need multiple anchors. This procedure not only maximizes the tendon-footprint contact area without using any implanted device but also theoretically lowers the bone laceration rate and is cost effective. In the current Technical Note, the procedure is described in detail along with several tips and tricks. Classifications: Level I, shoulder; Level II, rotator cuff.

N2  - Arthroscopic distal clavicular autograft (DCA) is effective in shoulder instability with glenoid bone loss. The original technique uses an osteochondral autograft, fixed with screws or suture anchors. We developed a modified procedure called “congruent arc DCA” characterized by (1) use of drilling guides to optimize graft positioning and make the all-arthroscopic procedure safer and reproducible; (2) rotation of the DCA of 90° to reach a congruent arc with its undersurface; (3) fixation of the graft with cortical buttons to simplify its intra-articular passage, avoid hardware problems, and facilitate possible revision surgery; and (4) intraoperative use of a suture tensioner to achieve satisfactory compression of the graft and increase its consolidation.

N2  - Introduction: Scapular dyskinesis (SD) is associated with an increased risk of throwing-related shoulder injury onset, resulting in abnormalities in glenohumeral joint (GH) and scapular motions during pitching. The effects of SD on shoulder motion during pitching remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate kinematic alterations in GH and scapular motions during pitching in baseball players with type I SD. Methods: Sixty-seven university and independent-league baseball players with and without SD were included. Pitching motion was measured using an optical three-dimensional motion capture system, and a SD test was conducted to evaluate SD. SD was classified into types I–IV. The inter-rater reliability of SD assessment was calculated using kappa coefficients. Three-dimensional GH and scapular kinematics during pitching motion were analyzed. Results: The percentage of agreement representing the inter-rater reliability of SD assessment was 77.6% (52/67; kappa coefficient: 0.72). Overall, 24 and 27 participants were categorized into abnormal (type I SD) and normal group (type IV SD), respectively, with normal scapular motion; one individual with type III SD was excluded. The abnormal group exhibited a significantly increased GH external rotation angle (9°) and decreased scapular posterior tilt angle (6°) during the maximum external rotation period compared with the normal group. Conclusions: Baseball players in the abnormal group showed increased GH motion and decreased scapular motion during pitching. The SD test for the evaluation of type I SD can help predict excessive GH external rotation and decreased scapular posterior tilt during pitching.

N2  - Background: Altered scapular muscle activity is associated with abnormal scapular motions and shoulder pain. Hence, quantification of these activities is a challenging issue. Objectives: The purposes of this study were to establish the reliability of measuring levator scapula muscle thickness and to examine how thickness of this muscle changes with contraction. Methods: Twenty-one asymptomatic individuals (mean age 22.29 ± 2.17 years) participated in this study. Three separate ultrasound images of the levator scapula muscle were captured at the neck-shoulder junction at rest and during a loaded isometric contraction. The procedures were repeated twice, four to seven days apart to establish intra-rater test-retest reliability. Interclass correlation coefﬁcients (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM) were used to determine the reliability, and a paired t-test was performed to examine the difference in muscle thickness between two conditions. Results: The results demonstrated that intra-examiner reliability was good at rest (ICC = 0.88, SEM = 1.16 mm) and excellent during loaded isometric contraction (ICC = 0.95, SEM = 0.91 mm). Furthermore, the thickness of levator scapula muscle signiﬁcantly increased from rest to the loaded isometric contraction (Effect size = 1.99, P < 0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the thickness of the levator scapula muscle can be measured reliably at the neck-shoulder junction. Furthermore, ultrasound measures can reliably detect changes in muscle thickness from rest to a contracted state. Therefore, if the need exists to evaluate muscle morphology before and after any treatment strategy, thickness measurement of levator scapula can be determined reliably using ultrasound.

N2  - ■ Scapular dyskinesis can be present in healthy individuals as in patients with shoulder pathology. ■ Altered patterns of scapular kinematics can cause or exacerbate rotator cuff tear pathology. However, more research is needed. ■ Regardless of the cause or the consequence of rotator cuff tear, scapular dyskinesis impairs shoulder function, worsens the symptoms, and compromises the success of clinical intervention. ■ The available literature suggests physical therapy as the first treatment for degenerative cuff tears, and scapular dyskinesis should be addressed if present. Non-responsive cases or traumatic tears may require surgery. ■ Postsurgical physical therapy protocols after rotator cuff repair must consider scapular dyskinesia to improve the outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Professional bus drivers report a high prevalence of upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain which could be associated with scapular dyskinesis (SD). However, the evidence for valid and reliable screening methods for this condition is limited as SD among bus drivers is an emerging area of research. Therefore, the main aim of the study was to investigate the reliability of dynamic scapular motion test (DSMT) using video analysis as an accurate method to evaluate SD and to identify patterns of SD among bus drivers. METHODS: In total, 32 bus drivers from a private bus company with unilateral upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain participated in the study. The DSMT was conducted and the SD was captured in the video during shoulder flexion-abduction movements. Two investigators analyzed the video recordings and identified the patterns of SD. The intra- and interrater reliability were determined using the percentage of agreement and weighted Kappa coefficients (Kw). Descriptive analysis was used to examine the patterns of SD. FINDINGS: The intra- and interrater reliability of DSMT using video analysis were excellent (Kw coefficient: 0.762-0.878 and 0.87-1.00, respectively). About 56.2% and 53.1% of bus drivers presented SD with the shoulder flexion and abduction movements during DSMT. Medial border prominence (Type II pattern of SD) was identified as the common pattern of SD. CONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: The DSMT using video analysis showed excellent intra- and interrater reliability to evaluate SD. Occupational health practitioners can consider DSMT using video analysis to identify SD among people with upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain at the workplace.

N2  - Hypothesis and Background: Shoulder osteoarthritis can be divided into different glenoid types (A, B, C, and D) and subtypes. The aim of this study was to investigate if there is an association between the prearthropathy scapular anatomy, shoulder osteoarthritis, and different glenoid types and subtypes. Methods: Using principal components analysis, a statistical shape model (SSM) of the scapula was constructed from a data set of 110 computed tomographic (CT) scans. These subjects formed the control group. Next, CT scan images of 117 patients with osteoarthritis were classified according to the modified Walch classification. A complete 3-dimensional (3D) scapular bone model was created for every patient, and using the SSM, a reconstruction of their prearthropathy scapular anatomy was performed. Automated 3D measurements were performed in both the patient and control group to obtain glenoid version and inclination, critical shoulder angle (CSA), posterior acromial slope (PAS), lateral acromion angle, scapular offset, and the rotational alignment of the coracoacromial complex. These parameters were compared between controls, patients with osteoarthritis, and glenoid types and subtypes. Results: Mean version and inclination for the control group was 6° retroversion and 8° superior inclination (both SD 4°). The mean CSA, PAS, coracoid–posterior acromion angle, posterior acromion–scapular plane angle, and fulcrum axis ratio were 30° (SD 4°), 64° (SD 8°), 116° (SD 9°), 55° (SD 7°), and 46% (SD 4%), respectively. Patients with osteoarthritis had a significant lower CSA, posterior acromion–scapular plane angle, coracoid–posterior acromion angle, and fulcrum axis ratio (27°, 50°, 111°, and 44%, all P < .001). We found a significant difference between the control group and the respective glenoid types for the following parameters: mean CSA and coracoid–posterior acromion angle for A glenoids (27°, P = .001, and 111°, P = .007); mean version, CSA, PAS, coracoid–posterior acromion angle, posterior acromion–scapular plane angle, and fulcrum axis ratio for B glenoids (11°, 27°, 71°, 111°, 49°, and 43%, all P < .001); and mean version, CSA, and posterior acromion–scapular plane angle for D glenoids (2°, P = .002, 26°, P = .003, and 48°, P = .007). Discussion: There seems to be an association between prearthropathy scapular anatomy and shoulder osteoarthritis. A small lateral extension and less posterior rotation of the acromion is associated with shoulder osteoarthritis and is present in almost all types and subtypes of glenoid morphology. Furthermore, B and D glenoids are associated with, respectively, a more and less pronounced prearthropathy glenoid retroversion.

N2  - Purpose: The goal of the study is to determine the inter-rater agreement on multiple factors that were utilized to evaluate the quality of pediatric chest X-ray exams from different levels of healthcare provision in an African setting. Methods: The image quality of pediatric chest X-rays from 3 South African medical centers of varying level of healthcare service were retrospectively assessed by 3 raters for 12 quality factors including: (1) absent body parts; (2) under inspiration; (3) patient rotation; (4) scapula in the way; (5) patient kyphosis/lordosis; (6) artefact/foreign body; (7) central vessel visualization; (8) peripheral vessels visualization; (9) poor collimation; and (10) trachea and bronchi visualization; (11) post-cardiac vessel visualization; and (12) absent or wrong image orientation. Analysis was performed using the Brennan-–Prediger coefficient of agreement for inter-rater reliability and Cochran's Q statistic and McNemar's test for inter-rater bias. Results: 1077 X-rays were reviewed. The least difference between observers in the frequency of the errors was noticed for factors (1) absent body parts and (12) absent or wrong image orientation with almost perfect agreement between raters. κ score for these two factors among all raters and between each pair of raters was more than 0.95 with no significant inter-rater bias. Conversely, there was poor agreement for the remaining factors with the least agreed on being factor (3) patient rotation with a κ score of 0.23. This was followed by factors (2) under inspiration (κ score of 0.32) and factors (4) scapula in the way (κ score of 0.35) respectively. There was significant inter-rater bias for all these three factors. Conclusion: Many of the factors used to assess the quality of a chest X-ray in children demonstrate poor reliability despite mitigation against variations in training, standard quality definitions and level of healthcare service provision. New definitions, objective measures and recording tools for assessing pediatric chest radiographic quality are required.

N2  - Background: People with chronic shoulder pain have been shown to present with motor adaptations during arm movements. These adaptations may create abnormal physical stress on shoulder tendons and muscles. However, how and why these adaptations develop from the acute stage of pain is still not well-understood. Objective: To investigate motor adaptations following acute experimental shoulder pain during upper limb reaching. Methods: Forty participants were assigned to the Control or Pain group. They completed a task consisting of reaching targets in a virtual reality environment at three time points: (1) baseline (both groups pain-free), (2) experimental phase (Pain group experiencing acute shoulder pain induced by injecting hypertonic saline into subacromial space), and (3) Post experimental phase (both groups pain-free). Electromyographic (EMG) activity, kinematics, and performance data were collected. Results: The Pain group showed altered movement planning and execution as shown by a significant increased delay to reach muscles EMG peak and a loss of accuracy, compared to controls that have decreased their mean delay to reach muscles peak and improved their movement speed through the phases. The Pain group also showed protective kinematic adaptations using less shoulder elevation and elbow flexion, which persisted when they no longer felt the experimental pain. Conclusion: Acute experimental pain altered movement planning and execution, which affected task performance. Kinematic data also suggest that such adaptations may persist over time, which could explain those observed in chronic pain populations.

N2  - The objective of this report was to introduce a new suture augmentation of coracoclavicular (CC) and acromioclavicular ligament reconstruction for acute Rockwood grade III to V acromioclavicular dislocations. From January 2015 to January 2019, 43 patients with Rockwood III to VI acute acromioclavicular dislocations were retrospectively reviewed. For comparison, another series of 28 patients treated with double Endobutton technique from January 2011 to December 2014 were reviewed. A P <.05 was considered statistical significance. The mean follow-up period of the 2 series were 39.69 ± 7.42 months (range, 24-54 months) and 37.86 ± 8.23 months (range, 26-48 months) (P >.05), respectively. There were significant differences regarding CC space (11.62 ± 2.54 mm vs 16.78 ± 5.53 mm; P <.05), CC reduction loss (5.56 ± 4.73 mm vs 26.25 ± 4.42 mm; P <.05), and acromioclavicular space (6.89 ± 1.87 mm vs 7.95 ± 2.37 mm; P <.05). There were significant differences regarding the disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand questionnaire (3.3 ± 2.8 vs 5.32 ± 4.37; P <.05) and University of California-Los Angeles shoulder rating scale (31.19 ± 2.48 vs 29.24 ± 2.48; P <.05). The excellent to good percentages were 100% (n = 32) and 85% (n = 23), respectively. In conclusion, the suture augmentation of acromioclavicular and CC ligament reconstruction is a reliable technique for acute acromioclavicular dislocation with minimal complications. Type of study/level of evidence: Therapeutic IIa.

N2  - Optimal throwing speed and accuracy is built on a complex interaction of multiple variables. Although strength and power has been associated with throwing speed in cricketers, the individual muscles that contribute to optimal function of the shoulder-complex has not been adequately explored in connection with throwing performance. Consequently, this study aimed to investigate the correlation between musculoskeletal variables and overhead throwing performance in cricketers. Thirty-two amateur male cricketers were tested using a battery of 16 tests (strength, flexibility, scapula positioning) as well as a throwing speed (TS) and a novel accuracy test (TA). Only two of the sixteen tests were correlated with throwing performance in the multiple regression analysis. Non-dominant hip abduction strength correlated positively with TS (p < 0.05): on average, a strength increase of 10 newtons (N) was associated with an increase in TS of 0.60 km/h (95% CI: 0.12-1.08). Non-dominant pectoralis minor length correlated positively with TA (p < 0.01): on average, a one-centimetre increase in the length correlated to an increase, of 0.633 points (95% CI: 0.225-1.041). This cross-sectional study demonstrated that from an array of musculoskeletal variables, only non-dominant hip abduction strength correlated with TS, while only non-dominant pectoralis minor length correlated with TA in amateur cricketers.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that arthroscopic Bankart repair with associated arthroscopic subscapularis augmentation (ASA) could be a valid surgical option in the treatment of anterior shoulder instability, in collision and contact sports athletes, affected by shoulder hyperlaxity. Methods: In total, 591 arthroscopic Bankart repairs plus ASA were performed in 6 shoulder centers from 2009 to 2017. Inclusion criteria were the following: collision and contact sports activities, recurrent anterior instability associated with hyperlaxity and glenoid bone loss (GBL) < 15%. Exclusion criteria were GBL > 15%, voluntary instability, multidirectional instability, pre-existing osteoarthritis and throwing athletes. The minimum follow-up was 24 months. Hyperlaxity was clinically evaluated according to Neer and Coudane-Walch tests. Before surgery, all patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scanning. Pico area method was used to assess the percentage of GBL. Patients were operated on by 6 surgeons, and their functional outcomes were evaluated by 2 independent observers. The Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI), Rowe, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores were used to assess results. Results: Overall, 397 patients with evidence of shoulder hyperlaxity (positive sulcus sign in ER1 position and Coudane-Walch test > 85°) met all inclusion criteria. The mean WOSI score was 321; the mean Rowe score rose from 68.5 to 92.5 (P =.037), and the ASES score rose from 71.5 to 97.4 (P =.041). Seven patients (1.6%) had atraumatic redislocation, and 9 patients (2.2%) had post-traumatic redislocation. At final follow-up the mean functional deficit of external rotation was 15° with the arm in adduction (ER1 position) and 10° in abduction (ER2 position). Conclusions: The Bankart repair plus ASA has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for restoring joint stability in patients practicing collision and contact sports or affected by chronic anterior shoulder instability associated with GBL (<15%) and hyperlaxity, without compromising external rotation. Level of Evidence: Level IV, case series.

N2  - The selection of relevant channels that produces optimal subset of electroencephalogram (EEG) features is of prime importance for i) reducing computational complexity, ii) reducing overfitting, and iii) eliminating inconveniences in users during clinical application. In the analysis of EEG signals acquired directly from the scalp, feature extraction and classification techniques play a key role in motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. Typically, the high-density EEG system used in this process is composed of 64 or more channels for EEG signal recordings. However, in practical applications, fewer channels are required for the system set up. Thus, for the current study, we aim to determine the optimal number of channels for the BCI system. We propose a channel selection strategy known as neuro-evolutionary algorithm, which is based on modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO), coupled with feature extraction by common spatial pattern. To validate the proposed method, we performed experiments using 64 channel EEG recordings from four trans-humeral amputees. The acquired signals from five motor imagery tasks were fed into a wrapper based neuro-evolutionary framework after the extraction stage. The performance results of the MPSO, when compared with other models like ant colony, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing, demonstrate the superiority of MPSO as the best performance with the most significant results. Further validation with electrocorticogram (ECoG) dataset IV of the BCI competition showed that the proposed model outperformed other commonly used methods by significantly decreasing the error rate and the number of EEG channels.

N2  - Background: A viable treatment option for young patients with massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears is arthroscopic superior capsule reconstruction (SCR). SCR theoretically improves shoulder stability and function and decreases pain. However, no prospective studies to date have correlated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) healing with in vivo kinematic data. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between graft healing and in vivo kinematics, range of motion (ROM), strength, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Methods: Ten patients (8 men and 2 women; mean age, 63 ± 7 years) with irreparable rotator cuff tears underwent arthroscopic SCR with dermal allograft. Strength was measured with isometric internal rotation and external rotation (ER) at 0° of abduction, ER at 90° of abduction, and scapular-plane abduction, whereas ROM was measured during shoulder flexion, abduction, and ER and internal rotation at 90° of abduction both before and 1 year after SCR. PROs included American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand surveys that were collected before and 1 year after SCR. Synchronized biplane radiographs were collected at 50 images/s before and 1 year after SCR while patients performed 3 trials of scapular-plane abduction. A validated volumetric tracking technique with submillimeter accuracy determined 6-df glenohumeral and scapular kinematics. The acromiohumeral distance (AHD), humeral head translation, and scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) were calculated from the in vivo kinematics. Healing at 5 locations was evaluated on 1-year postoperative MRI scans: anterior and posterior glenoid, anterior and posterior humerus, and posteriorly along the infraspinatus. Each subject was given a score from 0 to 5 based on number of sites healed. Results: Of the 10 patients, 9 (90%) had complete (n = 4) or partial (n = 5) healing of the graft whereas 1 (10%) had complete failure at the glenoid. No correlation existed between MRI healing and the AHD, SHR, strength, ROM, or PROs. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores all significantly improved from before to 1 year after SCR regardless of graft healing. Conclusions: The rate of complete or partial graft healing on MRI mimics findings of prior reports in the literature. MRI healing was correlated with humeral head anterior-posterior translation but not with the static and dynamic AHDs, SHR, humeral head superior-inferior translation, ROM, strength, or PROs 1 year after SCR. All PROs improved significantly from before to 1 year after SCR regardless of graft status on MRI. In vivo kinematic changes were small after SCR and not clinically significant, and the data suggest that improvements in clinical and functional outcomes may occur in the absence of full graft healing.

N2  - Background: Right- and left-side throwers in baseball may have different shoulder conditions and throwing biomechanics. This study aimed to compare the passive range of motion, humeral torsion, and clinical findings between right- and left-handed throwers who sustained throwing shoulder injuries and confirm the differences in the characteristics between throwing sides. Methods: A total of 52 pitchers diagnosed with throwing shoulder injuries were included in this study: 27 patients were right-side throwers (R group), and 25 were left-side throwers (L group). We measured the bilateral passive external and internal rotation angles in abduction position (ABIR) and total arc at their first visit. To assess posterior shoulder tightness, the internal rotation angles in forward flexion (FIR), and the abduction angle (AA) and horizontal flexion angle (HFA) without scapula motion were measured. The bilateral humeral torsion angles were also measured using ultrasonography. These values were compared between the participants' throwing and non-throwing sides and between the R and L groups' throwing sides. Furthermore, several physical findings in the shoulders were assessed, and the positive ratio was compared between the R and L groups. Results: On comparing the throwing and non-throwing sides, the R group had significantly greater external rotation angles in the abduction position and humeral torsion angle, and smaller ABIR, total arc, FIR, AA, and HFA in the throwing side, while the L group showed no significant differences, except for a smaller ABIR and larger HFA in the throwing side. On comparing the throwing side between the R and L groups, the R group had a smaller FIR, AA, and FHA than the L group. Regarding the physical findings, the posterior jerk test, Kim test, anterior and posterior drawer sign, sulcus sign, and scapular winging in the L group were significantly more positive than in the R group. Conclusion: The range of motion and humeral torsions differed between the left- and right-side throwers, as did the pathology between their throwing sides. Clinicians should consider the possibility that the pathological condition differs between left- and right-side throwers.

N2  - Background: This study establishes measurements to evaluate pathologic compensation in rotator cuff tear arthropathy and resultant considerations for reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Methods: Radiographs of patients with intact rotator cuffs were measured establishing interobserver and intraobserver reliability. Reverse shoulder arthroplasty cases performed by a single surgeon were then retrospectively reviewed. One year of follow-up radiographs were required for inclusion. Preoperative radiographs were analyzed for relative humeral head elevation ratio and humeral abduction relative to the glenoid face, termed the glenoid-intramedullary humeral angle. Statistical analyses assessed associations for radiographic measurements with presence and severity of scapular notching based on the Nerot-Sirveaux classification system. Results: A total of 221 patients met inclusion criteria. At the 1-year follow-up, 61 (27.6%) shoulders had radiographic notching. There was a moderately strong (r = -0.56) negative correlation between glenoid-intramedullary humeral angle and humeral head elevation ratio. Patients with humeral head elevation ratio ≥ 20% were significantly (P = .024) and 9.2 times more likely to have notching of any grade. Patients with glenoid-intramedullary humeral angle ≤ 5 degrees were significant (P < .0001) and 6.7 times more likely to have notching of any grade and significantly (P = .00018) and 145 times more likely to have high-grade (3 and 4) notching. Conclusions: Preoperative humeral head elevation and compensatory scapular rotation with relative adduction of the humerus have significant associations with high-grade notching. These radiographic findings have potential to help surgeons in preoperative decision-making regarding implant choice and patient education.

N2  - Aims The purpose of this study was to compare clinical results, long-term survival, and complication rates of stemless shoulder prosthesis with stemmed anatomical shoulder prostheses for treatment of osteoarthritis and to analyze radiological bone changes around the implants during follow-up. Methods A total of 161 patients treated with either a stemmed or a stemless shoulder arthroplasty for primary osteoarthritis of the shoulder were evaluated with a mean follow-up of 118 months (102 to 158). The Constant score (CS), the disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and hand (dASh) score, and active range of motion (roM) were recorded. radiological analysis for bone adaptations was performed by plain radiographs. A Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis was calculated and complications were noted. results The ROM (p < 0.001), CS (p < 0.001), and DASH score (p < 0.001) showed significant improvements after shoulder arthroplasty for both implants. There were no differences between the groups treated with stemmed or stemless shoulder prosthesis with respect to the mean CS (79.2 (35 to 118) vs 74.4 (31 to 99); p = 0.519) and dASh scores (11.4 (8 to 29) vs 13.2 (7 to 23); p = 0.210). The ten-year unadjusted cumulative survival rate was 95.3% for the stemmed anatomical shoulder prosthesis and 91.5% for the stemless shoulder prosthesis and did not differ between the treatment groups (p = 0.251). The radiological evaluation of the humeral components in both groups did not show loosening of the humeral implant. The main reason for revision for each type of arthroplasties were complications related to the glenoid. Conclusion The use of anatomical stemless shoulder prosthesis yielded good and reliable results and did not differ from anatomical stemmed shoulder prosthesis over a mean period of ten years. The differences in periprosthetic humeral bone adaptations between both implants have no clinical impact during the follow-up.

N2  - Background: Weighted radiographs are performed to classify acromioclavicular joint dislocations; however, the evidence regarding their usefulness is conflicting. Laboratory studies suggest that internal rotation views can replace weighted radiographs, but this has not been clinically evaluated. Purpose: To evaluate whether weighted or internal rotation radiographs uncovers more high-grade acromioclavicular joint dislocations than non-weighted radiographs. Material and Methods: A total of 162 patients with acromioclavicular joint dislocations were prospectively included. After applying exclusion criteria, 140 remained. Three panorama radiographs, including both coracoclavicular intervals, were completed of each participant: first, a weighted radiograph with 5-kg weights suspended from the wrists; second, a non-weighted radiograph; and third, an internal rotation radiograph. The coracoclavicular intervals were measured by two radiologists independently, and measurements were translated into Rockwood classifications. The classifications and measurements derived from the different radiographic views were compared. Results: Weighted radiographs caused no significant changes in classification. For the internal rotation views, there was a significant change in classification for radiologist 2; however, the reason was that more injuries were downgraded compared to the non-weighted views. Relative to the non-weighted radiographs, the mean increase of the coracoclavicular interval on the injured side in the weighted view was 0.5 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37–0.65) and in the internal rotation view 0.2 mm (95% CI 0.04–0.33). While these changes were statistically significant, they were small and not clinically important. Conclusion: This study does not support the use of weighted and internal rotation radiographs in the classification of acromioclavicular joint dislocations.

N2  - The present double-blinded, randomized controlled study sought to compare the effects of a full-body manual massage (MM) and a foam rolling (FR) intervention on subjective and objective indexes of performance and well-being. A total of 65 healthy individuals were randomly allocated to an FR, MM, or a control group who received a cognitively oriented relaxation routine. Self-report ratings of perceived anxiety, muscle relaxation, and muscle pain were used to index changes in affect and physical sensations. The sit-and-reach and toe-touch tests, as well as a mental calculation task, were used to index motor and cognitive performances, respectively. We also conducted resting-state electroencephalography and continuous skin conductance recordings before and after the experimental intervention. Both FR and MM groups exhibited neural synchronization of alpha and beta oscillations during the posttest. Skin conductance increased from the pretest to the posttest in the relaxation group, but decreased in the FR group. All interventions improved range of motion, although only the MM group outperformed the relaxation group for the toe-touch performance. MM was associated with reduced muscle pain and increased muscle relaxation. Reduced perceived anxiety after the intervention was observed in the FR group only. Overall, MM and FR both improved objective and subjective indexes of performance and well-being. Differences between the two massage interventions are discussed in relation to the effects of pressure stimulation on autonomic regulations and the proactive vs. retroactive nature of FR, compared to MM.

N2  - Background: Clavicular hook plates are frequently used in clinical orthopedics to treat acromioclavicular joint dislocation. However, patients often exhibit acromial osteolysis and peri-implant fracture after hook plate fixation. To solve the above problems, we developed a novel double-hook clavicular plate and used finite element analysis (FEA) to investigate its biomechanical properties. Methods: A finite element (FE) model was constructed and validated. Then, a double-hook clavicular plate, a single-hook clavicular plate, and an anatomical double-hook clavicular plate was implanted into the acromioclavicular joint and fixed with screws in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Finally, a load was applied, and some indicators were recorded and analyzed. Results: For both the proximal clavicular rotation angle and the distal clavicular displacement, the range of motion in groups 1 and 3 was more than 90% lower than that in group 2. The maximum von Mises stress of the clavicle in groups 1 and 3 was more than 45% lower than that in group 2. The maximum stress of the acromion in group 2 was significantly higher than that in groups 1 and 3, and that in group 3 was less than that in group 1, for both cortical and cancellous bone. Conclusions: The double-hook clavicular plate could immediately reconstruct the stability of the acromioclavicular joint, effectively reducing the stress of the bone around the clavicle and screws. Additionally, the double-hook clavicular plate could reduce the peak stress of the acromion and produce a more uniform stress distribution.

N2  - Motion analysis using inertial measurement units (IMU) has emerged as an alternative to optical motion capture. However, the validity and reliability of upper limb measurements varies significantly between studies. The objective of this study was to determine how sensor placement affects kinematic output in the assessment of motion of the arm, shoulder, and scapula. IMUs were placed proximally/distally on arms, and medially/laterally on the scapula, in a group of eleven healthy participants, while performing nine different motion tasks. Linear regressions and mixed models analysed how these different sensor placements affected the estimated joint motion by establishing the linear relationship between sensors placed on the same body segment. The placement of sensors affected the measured kinematic output considerably, most prominent affect was seen for sensor placement on scapula during flexion and abduction, and on forearm during pronation/supination. The slope of the linear regression lines was 2.5 during flexion, 2.7 during abduction, and 1.8 for forearm pronation/supination. The results of this study suggest that the forearm sensor should be placed on the dorsal side of the forearm, at the distal end; the upper arm sensor should be placed laterally, on the distal part of the arm; and the sensor on the scapula should be placed cranially, along the spine of scapula.

N2  - Nearly 1 in 60 adolescent athletes will suffer anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries with 90% of these athletes electing to undergo an ACL reconstruction (ACLR) at an estimated annual cost of $3 billion. While ACLR and subsequent rehabilitation allow these athletes to return to sports, they have a 15-fold increased risk of second ACL injuries. The modification of post-operative rehabilitation to improve movement and loading symmetry using visual and tactile biofeedback could decrease the risk factors for sustaining a second ACL injury. Participants included 40 adolescent ACLR patients who were intending to return to full sport participation. This preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined the changes in knee extension moment symmetry, a known risk factor for second ACL injuries, during landing from a stop-jump task between the following time-points: pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, and subsequent follow-up 6-weeks post-intervention. Participants met twice per week for six-weeks (12-session). The intervention included bilateral squat biofeedback (visual and tactile); the attention control group attended weekly educational sessions. This RCT enrolled and randomize 40 participants over a two-and-a-half-year period. All participants were greater than 4.5 months post-op from a primary, unilateral ACLR and were released to participate by their treating physician. The findings from this pilot biofeedback RCT will provide critical effect size estimates for use in subsequent larger clinical trials.

N2  - CONTEXT: A single clinical assessment device that can be used to objectively measure scapular motion in each anatomical plane is not currently available. The development of a novel electric goniometer would allow scapular motion in all 3 anatomical planes to be quantified. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reliability and validity of an electric goniometer for measuring scapular motion in each anatomical plane during upper extremity elevation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Sixty participants (29 women, 31 men; age = 30 ± 14 years, height = 1.73 ± 0.10 m, mass = 75.32 ± 16.90 kg) recruited from the general population. INTERVENTION(S): An electric goniometer was used to record clinical measurements of scapular position at rest and total arc of motion (excursion) during active upper extremity elevation in 2 testing sessions separated by several days. Measurements were recorded independently by 2 examiners. In 1 session, scapular motion was recorded simultaneously using a 14-camera, 3-dimensional optical motion-capture system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Reliability analysis included examination of clinical measurements for scapular position at rest and excursion during each condition. Both the intrarater reliability between testing sessions and the interrater reliability recorded in the same session were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs [2,3]). The criterion validity was examined by comparing the mean excursion values of each condition recorded using the electric goniometer and the 3-dimensional optical motion-capture system. Validity was assessed by evaluating the average difference and root mean square error. RESULTS: The between-sessions intrarater reliability was moderate to good (ICC [2,3] range = 0.628-0.874). The within-session interrater reliability was moderate to excellent (ICC [2,3] range = 0.545-0.912). The average difference between total excursion values recorded using the electric goniometer and the 3-dimensional optical motion-capture system ranged from -7° to 4°, and the root mean square error ranged from 7° to 10°. CONCLUSIONS: The reliability of scapular measurements was best when a standard operating procedure was used. The electric goniometer provided an accurate measurement of scapular excursions in all 3 anatomical planes during upper extremity elevation.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine and compare the accuracy of different activity monitors in assessing intermittent outdoor walking in both healthy and clinical populations through the development and validation of processing methodologies. METHODS: In study 1, an automated algorithm was implemented and tested for the detection of short (≤1 min) walking and stopping bouts during prescribed walking protocols performed by healthy subjects in environments with low and high levels of obstruction. The following parameters obtained from activity monitors were tested, with different recording epochs0.1s/0.033s/1s/3s/10s and wearing locationsscapula/hip/wrist/ankle: GlobalSat DG100 (GS) and Qstarz BT-Q1000XT/-Q1000eX (QS) speed; ActiGraph wGT3X+ (AG) vector magnitude (VM) raw data, VM counts, and steps; and StepWatch3 (SW) steps. Furthermore, linear mixed models were developed to estimate walking speeds and distances from the monitors parameters. Study 2 validated the performance of the activity monitors and processing methodologies in a clinical population showing profile of intermittent walking due to functional limitations during outdoor walking sessions. RESULTS: In study 1, GS1s, scapula, QS1s, scapula/wrist speed, and AG0.033s, hip VM raw data provided the highest bout detection rates (>96.7%) and the lowest root mean square errors in speed (≤0.4 km·h-1) and distance (<18 m) estimation. Using SW3s, ankle steps, the root mean square error for walking/stopping duration estimation reached 13.6 min using proprietary software and 0.98 min using our algorithm (total recording duration, 282 min). In study 2, using AG0.033s, hip VM raw data, the bout detection rate (95% confidence interval) reached 100% (99%-100%), and the mean (SD) absolute percentage errors in speed and distance estimation were 9% (6.6%) and 12.5% (7.9%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: GPS receivers and AG demonstrated high performance in assessing intermittent outdoor walking in both healthy and clinical populations.

N2  - The kinematic analysis in tennis forehand drive is crucial to understand the quality of this technique. The inertial measurement units (IMUs) due to its portability, occlusion free, larger capturing area and faster set up preparation, present an alternative to the optical motion capture systems (OS) considered a reference criterion system, however the degree of accuracy is task specific. This study aimed to compare the concurrent validity of a IMUs (Xsens MVN system) with an OS (Qualisys AB) for measuring upper and lower limb kinematics. Variables were evaluated during the forehand drive acceleration phase performed by 29 participants. The results demonstrated an excellent coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC) values (CMC ≥ 0.95), for the majority of the variables with exception of shoulder in the anteroposterior plane (CMC: 0.85), and elbow in the axial plane (CMC: 0.79). Root-mean-square error (RMSE) were considered from good to tolerable (1.5° ≤ RMSE ≤ 6.7°), with exception of the elbow joint angle in transverse plane (RMSE: 13.1°). One dimensional (1D) statistical parametrical mapping (SPM) demonstrated good agreement between the two systems, with exception of elbow in transverse plane. The present work presents an important advancement to a more frequently use of the IMU's in tennis, as well as in other racket sports.

N2  - Background: Stretching is often used to prevent and treat posterior shoulder capsule tightness; however, the most effective stretching positions are not clearly defined. The purpose of this study was to identify the stretching positions that specifically applied the greatest passive tension on the posterior shoulder capsule by evaluating the elastic characteristics of posterior capsules and muscles in various stretching positions using ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE). Methods: We evaluated 9 fresh-frozen shoulders (mean age 86.6 ± 7.7 years) without osteoarthritis or rotator cuff tears. All posterior shoulder tissues were preserved intact. Shear moduli of the middle and inferior posterior shoulder capsules and the posterior shoulder muscles were evaluated using SWE. We obtained shear modulus measurements in 9 stretching positions using a combination of glenohumeral elevation planes and angles (frontal, sagittal, scapular; –30°, 0°, 30°, 60°, respectively). A 4-Nm torque for shoulder internal rotation or horizontal adduction was applied in each position. We also measured shear moduli in the resting position (0° elevation with neutral shoulder internal/external rotation). We compared the shear moduli of all stretching and resting positions using 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance (P < .05). In addition, we compared the shear modulus in 2 positions (ie, resting and each stretching) among tissues (ie, capsules and muscles) with repeated measures using 2-way analysis of variance (P < .05). Results: Shear modulus values for the middle posterior capsules in “internal rotation at 30° in scapular plane elevation” (28.7 ± 14.3 kPa, P = .01) and in “horizontal adduction at 60° of elevation” (31.1 ± 13.1 kPa, P < .001) were significantly higher than that of the resting position (11.0 ± 7.3 kPa). The shear modulus value for the inferior posterior capsule in “internal rotation at 30° of flexion” was significantly higher than that of the resting position (39.0 ± 17.3 vs. 15.4 ± 13.9 kPa, respectively; P = .004). Additionally, the shear modulus values for the posterior capsules in “internal rotation at 30° in scapular plane elevation and flexion” were significantly higher than that of the posterior shoulder muscles. Conclusion: Effective middle posterior shoulder capsule stretching positions were shoulder “internal rotation at 30° of scapular plane elevation” and “horizontal adduction at 60° of elevation.” Shoulder “internal rotation at 30° of flexion” was the most effective position for the inferior posterior shoulder capsule. Stretching in these positions could relieve posterior shoulder capsule tightness and contribute to the prevention and treatment of throwing injuries of the shoulder.

N2  - Purpose: To compare the clinical and radiologic outcomes of arthroscopically assisted coracoclavicular (CC) fixation using multiple soft anchor knots versus hook plate fixation in patients with acute high-grade Rockwood type III and V acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations. Methods: This retrospective study included 22 patients with acute Rockwood type III and V AC joint dislocations who underwent arthroscopic fixation or hook plate fixation surgery between February 2016 and March 2018. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: arthroscopically assisted CC fixation using multiple soft anchor knots group (AR, n = 12) and hook plate fixation group (HO, n = 10). We measured the CC distances (CCDs) and CCD ratio at 6 months, 1 year, and last follow-up postoperatively to compare the radiologic results between the groups. Clinical outcomes were assessed at 1 year postoperatively and at the last follow-up using the Visual Analog Scale, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores, and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) scores, and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Magnetic resonance imaging after hook plate removal was used to evaluate the healing ligaments and tendon–bone interface. Results: The patients in the AR group had better ASES, SPADI, and Quick DASH scores than the patients in the HO group at 1 year postoperatively and at last follow-up. The CCD and CCD ratio were significantly better in the AR group than in the HO group at the last follow-up period (P = .007/0.029). Magnetic resonance imaging findings showed grade I in 60% of patients in the AR group and grade III in 60% of patients in the HO group. AC joint arthritic change was observed in 40% of the HO group. Conclusions: The CC fixation method using multiple soft anchor knots showed satisfactory results and had superior CC ligament healing ability and maintenance of CCD than hook fixation. Level of Evidence: Level III, retrospective therapeutic comparative investigation.

N2  - Among the many different procedures available in the treatment of shoulder instability, the Trillat procedure remains indicated in case of recurrent shoulder instability in elderly patient with an irreparable cuff tear or in case of hyperlaxity. Despite the constantly increasing number of arthroscopic assisted techniques, the open procedure remains a simple, reliable and fast surgical procedure with a shorter learning curve than the arthroscopic techniques. It consists in a partial osteotomy of the anterior cortical of the coracoid process which is then tilted and fixed with a screw into the anterior part of the scapula downwards and medially to obtain a re-centering effect due to the conjoint tendon on the humeral head when rotational movement are applied. This article aims to present a stepwise approach for the open surgical technique.

N2  - Objective To develop and assess a novel guidance technique and instrumentation system for minimally invasive short-stemmed total shoulder arthroplasty that will help to reduce the complications associated with traditional open replacement such as poor muscle healing and neurovascular injury. We have answered key questions about the developed system including (1) can novel patient-specific guides be accurately registered and used within a minimally invasive environment?; (2) can accuracy similar to traditional techniques be achieved? Methods A novel intra-articular patient-specific guide was developed for use with a new minimally invasive posterior surgical approach that guides bone preparation without requiring muscle resection or joint dislocation. Additionally, a novel set of instruments were developed to enable bone preparation within the minimally invasive environment. The full procedure was evaluated in six cadaveric shoulders, using digitizations to assess accuracy of each step. Results Patient-specific guide registration accuracy in 3D translation was 2.2±1.2mm (RMSE±1 SD; p = 0.007) for the humeral component and 2.7±0.7mm (p<0.001) for the scapula component. Final implantation accuracy was 2.9±3.0mm (p = 0.066) in translation and 5.7.6.8 ±2.2.4.0° (0.001<p<0.009) across the humerus implants' three rotations. Similarly, the glenoid component's implantation accuracy was 3.0±1.7mm (p = 0.008) in translation and 2.3. 4.3±2.2.4.4° (0.008<p<0.09) in rotation. Conclusion This system achieves minimally invasive shoulder replacement with accuracy similar to traditional open techniques while avoiding common causes of complications. Significance This novel technique could lead to a paradigm shift in shoulder arthroplasty for patients with moderate arthritis, which could significantly improve rehabilitation and functional outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, there have been no published clinical trials to assess the synergistic effects of applying pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) stimulation of the suprascapular nerve (SSN) plus physical therapy on pain and function in patients with adhesive capsulitis. Therefore, we will conduct this present randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the synergistic effects of applying PRF stimulation of the SSN plus physical therapy on pain and function in patients with adhesive capsulitis. METHODS: The study protocol is a randomized, controlled, double-blind design. Recruitment will be started in March 2021 and completed in October 2022. The treating surgeon will assess 90 patients for eligibility. The study protocol was approved through Institutional Review Board in the People's Hospital of Beilun district of Ningbo. Each patient will be randomized into 3 treatment groups, receiving PRF stimulation of the SSN or physical therapy or both of them. After baseline examination, all patients will be given a full explanation of the treatment protocol and will be required to sign a written informed consent for study participation and for publication of the results. All the data collectors, surgeons, statistical analysts, as well as result assessors are not aware of grouping assignment. The outcomes include Constant score, visual analog scale score, range of motion, and strength. RESULTS: This protocol will provide a reliable theoretical basis for the following research. CONCLUSION: It is assumed that there will be a remarkable difference in postoperative outcomes between the intervention and control groups. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 10.17605/OSF.IO/PZ9ES.

N2  - Background: White matter stimulation in an awake patient is currently the gold standard for identification of functional pathways. Despite the robustness and reproducibility of this method, very little is known about the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying the functional disruption. Axono-cortical evoked potentials (ACEPs) provide a reliable technique to explore these mechanisms. Objective: To describe the shape and spatial patterns of ACEPs recorded when stimulating the white matter of the caudal part of the right superior frontal gyrus while recording in the precentral gyrus. Methods: We report on three patients operated on under awake condition for a right superior frontal diffuse low-grade glioma. Functional sites were identified in the posterior wall of the cavity, whose 2–3-mA stimulation generated an arrest of movement. Once the resection was done, axono-cortical potentials were evoked: recording electrodes were put over the precentral gyrus, while stimulating at 1 Hz the white matter functional sites during 30–60 s. Unitary evoked potentials were averaged off-line. Waveform was visually analyzed, defining peaks and troughs, with quantitative measurements of their amplitudes and latencies. Spatial patterns of ACEPs were compared with patients’ own and HCP-derived structural connectomics. Results: Axono-cortical evoked potentials (ACEPs) were obtained and exhibited complex shapes and spatial patterns that correlated only partially with structural connectivity patterns. Conclusion: ACEPs is a new IONM methodology that could both contribute to elucidate the propagation of neuronal activity within a distributed network when stimulating white matter and provide a new technique for preserving motor control abilities during brain tumor resections.

N2  - Introduction: Dry needling of the periscapular musculature is a procedure commonly performed by physical therapists. Needling of the deep musculature may be challenging, and use of a thoracic rib as a “backstop” is often applied to prevent inadvertent puncture of the pleura. The aim of this study was to: 1) To examine the accuracy rate of experienced physical therapists in identifying a mid-scapular thoracic rib using palpation, 2) to understand patient characteristics that affect the accuracy rate, and 3) to examine if therapist confidence levels were associated with palpatory accuracy. Methods: Two experienced physical therapists attempted to palpate a thoracic rib in the mid-scapular region of healthy participants (n = 101 subjects, 202 ribs), and self-reported their level of confidence in an accurate palpation. Their accuracy was verified with ultrasonography. Results: The two physical therapists were accurate on 73.3% of palpations and did not differ in accuracy (72.0% vs. 75.0%, p = 0.747). The only ultrasonographic or subject characteristic measurement that correlated with improved accuracy was a reduced muscle thickness (p = 0.032). Therapists’ self-reported confidence levels did not correlate to actual accuracy (p = 0.153). Discussion: Physical therapists should be aware that palpation of a thoracic rib may not be as accurate as it may seem. The greater thickness of muscle in the area reduces the accuracy of accurate palpation. Conclusion: Dry needling of the periscapular muscles should be done with caution if using a rib as a “blocking” technique.

N2  - Introduction: Individuals with shoulder and upper extremity pathology often present with altered scapular motion. Few studies have looked at variations in scapular acceleration as a way of quantifying scapular motion. The purpose was to determine the effectiveness of wireless accelerometers for detecting changes in acceleration in individuals with scapular dyskinesis. Materials/methods: Twenty-seven asymptomatic college students (mean age 24 (SD ± 1.54), 65% female, 93% right handed) were visually screened for scapular dyskinesis using previously described criteria. Of the students recruited, fifteen students were determined to have scapular dyskinesis. After securing a wireless accelerometer (MyoResearch 3D DTS) on the dominate scapula, the participants performed five repetitions of standing scaption from 0 to 140°. Linear scapular accelerations along three orthogonal axes (frontal-y, transverse-z, and sagittal-x) were collected. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC3, k) were used to determine the between day intra-rater reliability while a one-way analysis of variance was used to determine differences in acceleration between those with and without dyskinesis. Results: There was good between day intra-rater reliability for the average of all three axes (ICC = 0.79) and for the x and y axes (ICC > 0.78). Reliability was poor (ICC = 0.31) for the z-axis. There was a significant increase in overall acceleration of the scapula in those with dyskinesis (p = .039). There was also a significant increase in acceleration along the y-axis for those with dyskinesis (p = .003) but not for the other axes (p > .16). Conclusion: Wireless accelerometers reliably quantify scapular acceleration in healthy individuals. In a healthy population with dyskinesis, the overall magnitude of scapular acceleration was greater when compared to a healthy group without dyskinesis.

N2  - The shoulder is one of the human body's most complex joint systems, with motion occurring through the coordinated actions of four individual joints, multiple ligaments, and approximately 20 muscles. Unfortunately, shoulder pathologies (e.g., rotator cuff tears, joint dislocations, arthritis) are common, resulting in substantial pain, disability, and decreased quality of life. The specific etiology for many of these pathologic conditions is not fully understood, but it is generally accepted that shoulder pathology is often associated with altered joint motion. Unfortunately, measuring shoulder motion with the necessary level of accuracy to investigate motion-based hypotheses is not trivial. However, radiographic-based motion measurement techniques have provided the advancement necessary to investigate motion-based hypotheses and provide a mechanistic understanding of shoulder function. Thus, the purpose of this article is to describe the approaches for measuring shoulder motion using a custom biplanar videoradiography system. The specific objectives of this article are to describe the protocols to acquire biplanar videoradiographic images of the shoulder complex, acquire CT scans, develop 3D bone models, locate anatomical landmarks, track the position and orientation of the humerus, scapula, and torso from the biplanar radiographic images, and calculate the kinematic outcome measures. In addition, the article will describe special considerations unique to the shoulder when measuring joint kinematics using this approach.

N2  - Age affects gross shoulder range of motion (ROM), but biomechanical changes over a lifetime are typically only characterized for the humerothoracic joint. Suitable age-related baselines for the scapulothoracic and glenohumeral contributions to humerothoracic motion are needed to advance understanding of shoulder injuries and pathology. Notably, biomechanical comparisons between younger or older populations may obscure detected differences in underlying shoulder motion. Herein, biplane fluoroscopy and skin-marker motion analysis quantified humerothoracic, scapulothoracic, and glenohumeral motion during 3 static poses (resting neutral, internal rotation to L4-L5, and internal rotation to maximum reach) and 2 dynamic activities (scapular plane abduction and external rotation in adduction). Orientations during static poses and rotations during active ROM were compared between subjects <35 years and >45 years of age (N = 10 subjects per group). Numerous age-related kinematic differences were measured, ranging 5–22°, where variations in scapular orientation and motion were consistently observed. These disparities are on par with or exceed mean clinically important differences and standard error of measurement of clinical ROM, which indicates that high resolution techniques and appropriately matched controls are required to avoid confounding results of studies that investigate shoulder kinematics. Understanding these dissimilarities will help clinicians manage expectations and treatment protocols where indications and prevalence between age groups tend to differ. Where possible, it is advised to select age-matched control cohorts when studying the kinematics of shoulder injury, pathology, or surgical/physical therapy interventions to ensure clinically important differences are not overlooked.

N2  - Background: The purpose of this study was to determine factors associated with early symptomatic acromial and scapular spine fractures in patients who underwent reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). Methods: We retrospectively evaluated all RTSAs performed by the senior author between 1/1/2013 and 6/1/2019. We evaluated patient demographics including gender, age, prevalence of comorbidities including osteoporosis, inflammatory arthritis, diabetes, and endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism. We also evaluated preoperative and 2-week postoperative radiographs for center of rotation medialization (CORM) as distance between the center of the humeral head or glenosphere and the line of the deltoid, and distalization via the acromial-greater tuberosity distance (AGT). We evaluated inter- and intra-rater reliability via intraclass correlation coefficients. Results: We included 335 RTSAs with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up in the analysis. Reliability was acceptable with all intraclass correlation coefficients> 0.75. Symptomatic acromial and scapular spine stress fractures were significantly more common in those with inflammatory arthritis than those without (18% vs. 5%, P = 0.016). The rate of fracture was highest in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (24% vs. 5.2%, P = 0.003). There was no statistically significant association between symptomatic fractures and preoperative CORM or AGT (P = 0.557, P = 0.528) or postoperative CORM or AGT (P = 0.56, P = 0.102). There also was no statistically significant correlation between symptomatic stress fracture and patient age, gender, BMI, smoking, osteoporosis, gout, medical comorbidity, or previous shoulder surgery. Conclusion: In this retrospective analysis of postoperative RTSA, symptomatic acromial and scapular stress fractures were significantly more common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and thus precautions should be taken in these patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Open fractures of the scapula are relatively rare and only a few studies are interested in this subject. This study aims to demonstrate the results of internal fixation of open scapula fractures due to gunshot injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight patients who had open scapula fractures and were treated by internal fixation through the conventional Judet approach included in this study. Patients were followed up monthly in the first 6 months and every 2 months in the rest of the follow-up. Shoulder range of motion, Constant Shoulder Score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score were used for functional evaluation. RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 34.6 ± 11.9 months. The average time between injuries and the surgery was 10.5 ± 5.1 days. The average shoulder abduction of the patients was 135.6 ± 18.8°, the average forward flexion of the shoulder was 160 ± 19.2°. The average internal and external rotations of the shoulders were 80 ± 14.1° and 63.1 ± 17.3°, respectively. CSS was calculated as 79.8 ± 14.4, and DASH was calculated as 14.1 ± 14.9. CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of open scapula fractures due to gunshot injuries, an internal fixation is a reliable option and the results were comparable with previous studies.

N2  - Background/Objective: Digital anthropometric (DA) assessments are increasingly being administered with three-dimensional (3D) optical devices in clinical settings that manage patients with obesity and related metabolic disorders. However, anatomic measurement sites are not standardized across manufacturers, precluding use of published reference values and pooling of data across research centers. Subjects/Methods: This study aimed to develop universal 3D analysis software by applying novel programming strategies capable of producing device-independent DA estimates that agree with conventional anthropometric (CA) measurements made at well-defined anatomic sites. A series of technical issues related to proprietary methods of 3D geometrical reconstruction and image analysis were addressed in developing major software components. To evaluate software accuracy, comparisons were made to CA circumference measurements made with a flexible tape at eleven standard anatomic sites in up to 35 adults scanned with three different commercial 3D optical devices. Results: Overall, group mean CA and DA values across the three systems were in good agreement, with ∼2 cm systematic differences; CA and DA estimates were highly correlated (all p-values <0.01); root-mean square errors were low (0.51–3.27 cm); and CA-DA bias tended to be small, but significant depending on anatomic site and device. Conclusions: Availability of this software, with future refinements, has the potential to facilitate clinical applications and creation of large pooled uniform anthropometric databases.

N2  - Sprengel’s deformity is a congenital anomaly characterized by a hypoplastic and elevated scapula that results in cosmetic and functional impairment. In this study, we report the results of 3 severe cases of bilateral Sprengel’s deformity with associated Klippel-Feil syndrome treated by the modified Woodward procedure. Between 2013 and 2015, 3 patients of a mean age of 5.4 years were diagnosed with bilateral Sprengel’s deformity and associated Klippel-Feil syndrome. All the shoulders were graded as Cavendish 4 and had a bar connecting the scapula with the cervical vertebrae. Patients were managed surgically with the modified Woodward procedure and a clavicular osteotomy. The mean follow-up time was 62 months. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were recorded and all patients remained neurologically intact. The average improvement of the abduction of the shoulders was 30° and the mean lowering of the scapula was 2.6 cm. All patients improved by at least 1 Cavendish grade. The modified Woodward procedure is a reliable and effective technique to improve shoulder cosmesis and function even in severe cases of bilateral Sprengel’s deformity with associated Klippel-Feil syndrome.

N2  - Background: Shoulder assessment in rehabilitation is focused on kinematic properties due to the variability of symptomatology and clinical expression of shoulder injuries. Aim: To perform a receiver operating characteristic analysis of the kinematic variables involved in the functional mobility of the shoulder that allow the identification of discriminating variables between healthy and diseased shoulders during scaption motion. Method: Analytical cross-sectional study of diagnostic effectiveness was performed in 27 subjects suffering from shoulder damage and 14 asymptomatic controls. Scaption kinematics were evaluated using four inertial sensors placed on the humerus, scapula, forearm and sternum. Three variables (mobility, velocity and acceleration) were obtained from each sensor and the norm of the resultant vector was calculated from each axis. A discriminatory receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed, obtaining the area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity. Findings: Significant differences from both the resultant vectors and the axis depended on the body segment analysed were observed. Greater movement velocity and acceleration were observed in the asymptomatic group. Receiver operating characteristic analysis, scapular protraction-retraction mobility distinguished with a diagnostic sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 90.9% between asymptomatic and shoulder-damaged patients. These diagnosis values were 83.3% and 72.7% for scapular anterior-posterior velocity. Scapular kinematics, in terms of mobility and velocity, are the key variables in shoulder assessment. Interpretation: This study discriminated between patients suffering from shoulder damage and asymptomatic subjects based on shoulder kinematics during scaption motion. Scapular mobility and velocity were found to be key variables in shoulder assessment, along with the humerus.

N2  - Introduction: Shoulder pain is leading cause of disability and pain among musculoskeletal pain patients. Ultrasound is coming in a bigger way for diagnosis and management of subacromial pain due to its low cost, easy availability and accuracy in detecting soft tissues pathologies and for planning further treatment. Aim: To assess the role of diagnostic Ultrasound (US) in subacromial shoulder pathologies evaluation in shoulder pain patients. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective observational study conducted on 98 patients who presented with subacromial shoulder pain. Diagnostic ultrasound examination was done and patients were categorised based upon underlying pathology and analysed in terms of frequency. Results: Most common ultrasound findings in subacromial shoulder pain patients were subacromial bursopathy 46 (46.93%) followed by Rotator cuff pathology including tear 38 (38.77%), mixed pathology 9 (9.18%) and Acromioclavicular (AC) joint pathology 5 (5.10%). Isolated biceps pathology was not seen in our study rather biceps pathology along with other tendon and joint involvement was observed. Conclusion: The findings in the present study imply that diagnostic ultrasound of shoulder pain patients helps to stratify them into different categories for better understanding of underlying pathology and targeted treatment approach. Ultrasound shall be used as an outpatient primary diagnostic modality for evaluation of subacromial shoulder pain patients.

N2  - Since the advent of Paul Grammont medialized reverse shoulder prosthesis in the 1980s, shoulder surgeons have had a reliable option for treating glenohumeral joint disease in the rotator cuff-deficient shoulder. However, the prosthesis is not without complications, including scapular notching, instability, and limited rotational motion. Implants have been modified from the original design in an effort to reduce the risk of these complications. Increasing the offset, or lateralization, of the glenosphere may reduce the rate of scapular notching, reduce impingement, increase stability, and improve rotational motion. However, a more lateralized glenosphere could lead to baseplate loosening, decreased deltoid efficiency, and increased risk of acromial fracture. Increasing the offset on the humeral side, rather than the glenosphere side, may be able to reduce the rate of scapular notching and improve rotational motion without an increased risk of baseplate loosening. Humeral lateralization also improves tension of the rotator cuff and maintains good deltoid efficiency. However, humeral lateralization provides little stability benefit, and acromial fracture remains a risk. Ultimately, the surgeon must be familiar with the implants he or she is using and the options for both glenosphere and humeral lateralization to ensure that risks and benefits can be weighed for each patient.

N2  - Assessment of scapulothoracic and glenohumeral contributions to shoulder function during baseball pitching are limited by challenges in accurately measuring dynamic scapular orientation. A recently validated individualized linear model approach that estimates scapular orientation based on measurable humerothoracic orientation has yet to be adapted for pitching and may improve upon currently recommended methods such as the acromion marker cluster (AMC). This study evaluates the ability of a pitching-specific individualized linear model to estimate scapular orientation in static positions throughout a throwing motion by comparing against palpation and an AMC. Individualized linear models were created for 14 collegiate pitchers by determining scapulothoracic and humerothoracic orientations at static arm postures throughout their individual dynamic throwing motions. Linear model and AMC estimates were compared against palpation at intermediate test positions within the throwing motion that were excluded from model creation. Linear model estimates were similar to palpation at all test positions and on all scapulothoracic axes while AMC estimates differed on internal/external rotation and anterior/posterior tilt during cocking (p = 0.001, p = 0.018) and follow-through (p = 0.003, p = 0.006). Linear model root mean square error (RMSE) values were smaller than AMC values for all positions/axes. Linear model RMSE values (2.8–6.3°) were within a range of published values previously deemed acceptable, while AMC values (5.1–15.8°) went beyond this range. The linear model approach accurately estimates static scapular orientation throughout a pitching motion and improves upon current methods. Future applications to dynamic pitching may facilitate understanding of how scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joint function relate to injury risks, rehabilitation, and performance.

We also aimed to investigate whether or not VFT can be used to determine sarcopenia. Methods: A total of 103 patients, 70 women and 33 men, who applied to the geriatric outpatient clinic were included in the study. VFT and skeletal muscle mass of the patients were measured by ultrasonography (USG) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Participants were divided into two groups as sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic. Results: The mean age were 75.23 ±6.95 years. In our study, there was a positive correlation between skeletal muscle index (SMI) with VFT (r: 0.356, p <0.001) and, a relation was found between low VFT and sarcopenia independent of age, gender, Katz activities of daily living (ADL) and mini nutritional assessment (MNA) (OR: 0.906 (0.855-0.961)). The optimal cut-off value of VFT to predict sarcopenia was measured as ≤24.97 mm for females, with 92% sensitivity and 70% specifity (AUC, 0.834; 95% CI, 0.714-0.953) and as ≤22.57 mm for males, with 89% sensitivity and 80% specifity (AUC, 0.921; 95% CI, 0.825-1.000). Conclusion: There was a positive relationship between skeletal muscle mass and VFT. VFT can be used as an alternative method for determining sarcopenia.

N2  - Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA) is a shoulder replacement procedure to treat severe rotator cuff deficiency, primarily caused by osteoarthritis in elderly patients. One of the critical factors in reducing postoperative complications is accurate drilling of a centring hole on the glenoid surface at a precise position and orientation. While the drilling path is planned pre-operatively on 3D diagnostic images, the absence of visual guidance during surgery can lead to low reproducibility. In this paper, we present the design and feasibility analysis of a marker-less image-based registration pipeline using the Microsoft HoloLens 1 and its built-in sensors to guide glenoid drilling during TSA. Our solution intra-operatively registers the pre-operative 3D scan to the exposed glenoid surface both with and without occlusion. Our results provide a breakdown of the sources contributing to registration error. In addition to the commonly discussed errors (SLAM-based head tracking, partial overlap etc.), we find that the poor performance of the depth sensing camera becomes a major source of error. We further find that partial overlap between the source and target remains a large concern for registration in high occlusion scenarios. This work begins to characterise the depth sensor error and suggests future work towards image-based augmented reality guidance.

N2  - OBJECTIVES Dental erosion, which is defined as the gradual but irreversible loss of hard tissue is a major dental issue as it may be linked to systemic diseases such as eating disorders or gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), giving rise to difficulties in diagnosis. In both pathological forms, the presence of gastric juices in the oral cavity causes the erosion of the palatal surfaces of the upper elements, often associated with variable sensitivity; carious lesions are generally not associated. Erosions associated with gastroesophageal reflux are often associated with mucosal irritation, oral ulcers and altered taste. It may be due to mechanical or chemical causes, which often lead to problems in treatment. Compared to traditional classifications, the ACE classification sees these lesions divided mainly related to the anterior sector and to the therapeutic intervention strategy. Early diagnosis is crucial to maximize therapeutic alternatives. The treatment of erosions is closely related to the amount of enamel and dentinal tissue involved as well as to the vertical dimension to be obtained in order to obtain satisfactory aesthetic results for the patient. Best erosion treatment involves a multi-disciplinary team and may range from direct composite reconstructions and fixed prostheses to innovative indirect reconstruction systems that aim at preserving as much tissue as possible. The new CAD/ CAM technology offers important advantages in terms of result forecasting, accuracy, precision and better patient-dentist communication. The principle aims of treatment are aesthetic rehabilitation, recovery of functional mastication, establishment of the correct vertical dimension and achievement of stable and reproducible outcomes. In this regard, a multidisciplinary treatment that involves various professional figures would seem to guarantee good and predictable results. MATERIALS AND METHODS The present clinical report describes the treatment of asymptomatic dental erosion in a patient with eating disorders associated with bruxism and cervical myalgia. The patient requested esthetic rehabilitation without invasive interventions. A multi-disciplinary approach included esthetic analysis which was followed by posture assessment using a stabilometric platform and a podoscope. A modified 3-step rehabilitation technique was supported by digital technology. Composite restorations were inserted in the posterior areas and double veneers in the anterior. The outcome was stable and easy to monitor. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The main objectives of prosthetic rehabilitation are preserving as much residual dental tissue as possible and achieving stable occlusal rehabilitation with a multi-disciplinary approach, involving dentists, physiatrists and posturologists. Treatment depends on careful assessment of postural and temporal-mandibular abnormalities, as well as tooth damage. A multidisciplinary approach to gether with the advantages of fered by CAD/CAM technology provides acceptable, predictable outcomes when treating dental erosive lesions. It is often partic ularly problematic to propose in vasive therapeutic solutions, in the absence of relevant clinical symptoms. New technologies, together with adhesive strategies in the pros thetic field, allow the partial over coming of this problem. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The proposed treatment rep resents a valid alternative to more invasive prosthetic reconstructions and highlights the importance of the multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of dental erosions.

N2  - Background: This paper outlines a summary of examination technique to identify the range of movement of the cervical spine. Due to common difficulties in obtaining tools for cervical examination within the district, a standardised compilation of easy-to-replicate examination techniques are provided using different tools. Methods: Bedside instruments that can be used includes a measuring tape, compass, goniometer, inclinometer and cervical range of motion (CROM) instrument. Discussion: Cervical flexion-extension, lateral flexion and rotation will be assessed with bedside instruments. This would aid in increasing accuracy and precision of objective measurement while conducting clinical examination to determine the cervical range of motion.

N2  - Background: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is a reliable, long-term treatment option for degenerative shoulder pathology. However, the functional outcomes degrade around the fifth year postoperation, particularly for internal and external rotation. Long-term radiographic changes have been reported around the humeral stem, depending on the fixation method. Objectives: The primary objective was to compare the clinical outcomes of RSAs by fixation method—cemented vs. press-fit—after a minimum follow-up of 5 years. We hypothesized that proximal humeral osteolysis impacts the functional outcomes. Design and Methods: Our study compared 2 matched cohorts: 56 RSAs with cemented stems and 56 RSAs with press-fit stems. We evaluated all the patients using the Constant-Murley score (CMS) and range of motion (ROM), which we measured preoperatively and at the final follow-up visit. We evaluated radiographs from the final follow-up visit to look for proximal humeral osteolysis with tuberosity resorption, signs of stress shielding, periprosthetic radiolucent lines, and scapular notching. Results: At a mean follow-up of 9.5 years (5-21), regardless of the fixation method, the RSA procedure helped to improve the CMS and active joint ROM postoperatively, except for internal and external rotation with elbow at side in the press-fit group. Shoulder ROM was significantly better in the group with cemented stems for anterior elevation (P <.001), abduction (P =.006), and external (P =.02) and internal rotation with elbow at side (P =.02). The CMS did not differ between groups. The presence of tuberosity resorption or scapular notching had no effect on the CMS and active ROM in either group. Osteopenia, which was more prevalent in the press-fit group, had no impact on the functional outcome. Conclusion: There was no significant difference between groups in the CMS, although the active shoulder ROM was significantly worse in the press-fit group. This difference could be attributed to more frequent tuberosity resorption in this group.

N2  - Purpose: To determine whether change in shoulder position between internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) during magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) affects previously defined capsular measurements and to determine the utility of rotation in the diagnosis of instability. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted of patients who received a shoulder MRA with humeral IR and ER views. Patients with an arthroscopically confirmed diagnosis of instability and those with clinically stable shoulders, no history of instability, and no MRA findings of instability were identified and compared. Humeral rotation, glenoid retroversion, humeral head subluxation, capsular length, and capsular area using axial sequences of IR and ER views were recorded. Analysis compared IR, ER, and Δ capsular measurements between groups using independent t tests and univariate and multivariate regression. Results: Thirty-one subjects who were diagnosed with instability were included, along with 28 control subjects. Capsular length, capsular area, and humeral subluxations were significantly greater with ER compared with IR views (P < .001, P < .001, P < .001). Patients with instability displayed greater ER capsular length (P = .0006) and ER capsular area (P = .005) relative to controls. Multivariate logistic regression identified age, weight, sex, ER capsular length, and retroversion to be significant predictors of instability. ER capsular length independently predicts instability with 86% sensitivity and 84% specificity. Interobserver reliability using the intraclass correlation coefficient was rated good or excellent on all measurements. Conclusion: Variance in humeral rotation during shoulder MRA significantly affects capsular measurements. Rotational views increase the utility of capsular measurements when assessing for instability, particularly capsular length and capsular area. The implementation of ER positioning enhances the ability to examine capsular changes of the shoulder joint and can assist in the diagnosis of instability.

N2  - Background: Posterior shoulder instability is uncommon, and its treatment is a challenging problem. An arthroscopically assisted technique for posterior iliac crest bone grafting (ICBG) has shown promising short- and long-term clinical results. Changes as shown on imaging scans after posterior ICBG for posterior shoulder instability have not been investigated in the recent literature. Purpose: To evaluate changes on computed tomography (CT) after arthroscopically assisted posterior ICBG and to assess clinical outcomes. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients with preoperative CT scans and at least 2 postoperative CT scans with a minimum follow-up of 2 years were included in the evaluation. Of 49 initial patients, 17 (follow-up rate, 35%) met the inclusion criteria and were available for follow-up. We measured the glenoid version angle and the glenohumeral and scapulohumeral indices on the preoperative CT scans and compared them with measurements on the postoperative CT scans. Postoperatively, graft surface, resorption, and defect coverage were measured and compared with those at early follow-up (within 16 months) and final follow-up (mean ± SD, 6.6 ± 2.8 years). Results: The mean preoperative glenoid version was –17° ± 13.5°, which was corrected to –9.9° ± 11.9° at final follow-up (P <.001). The humeral head was able to be recentered and reached normal values as indicated by the glenohumeral index (51.8% ± 6%; P =.042) and scapulohumeral index (59.6% ± 10.2%; P <.001) at final follow-up. Graft surface area decreased over the follow-up period, from 24% ± 9% of the glenoid surface at early follow-up to 17% ± 10% at final follow-up (P <.001). All clinical outcome scores had improved significantly. Progression of osteoarthritis was observed in 47% of the shoulders. Conclusion: Arthroscopically assisted posterior ICBG restored reliable parameters as shown on CT scans, especially glenoid version and the posterior subluxation indices. Graft resorption was common and could be observed in all shoulders. Patient-reported clinical outcome scores were improved. Osteoarthritis progression in almost 50% of patients is concerning for the long-term success of this procedure.

N2  - Total shoulder arthroplasty is an effective procedure in restoring anatomy and biomechanics of the arthritic shoulder. It provides excellent clinical results, and its use is increasing worldwide. Glenoid loosening is the weak link in shoulder replacement, accounting for nearly one third of all total shoulder arthroplasty complications. Its causes and possible solutions have been object of extensive investigation. To strengthen glenoid fixation and provide long-term survival to the implant, several technical improvements have been proposed, different materials have been tested and various prosthetic glenoid designs have been developed, including cemented and uncemented all-polyethylene components, metal-backed, hybrid, inlay and augmented components. Thus, the surgeon has been provided with many options, but no clear superiority of one implant over the others has been proved. The choice of the right implant requires careful evaluation of patient's pathology, anatomy and expectation and a thorough understanding of prosthetic shoulder biomechanics and of mechanisms of failure. The aim of this review is to discuss the available options for glenoid implants in TSA, describe the causes of failure and report author's preferences in glenoid replacement.

N2  - Background: In adults, anterior glenohumeral instability has been associated with a tall and narrow glenoid morphology, assessed using the glenoid index (GI; glenoid height-to-width ratio) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This morphological association has not been assessed in children and adolescents. Purpose/Hypothesis: To examine the association of GI and other MRI measurements of interest supported in studies on adults with anterior glenohumeral dislocation in patients aged ≤19 years. We hypothesized that these patients would have a significantly greater GI (relatively taller and narrower glenoid morphology) compared with healthy controls. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: An institutional radiology database was queried over a 10-year period to identify patients aged ≤19 years who had been diagnosed with radiographically confirmed anterior shoulder dislocation and who underwent glenohumeral magnetic resonance arthrography as well as those without dislocation with normal shoulder arthrogram studies (controls). Patients with bony Bankart lesions were excluded. The following glenohumeral dimensions were measured on shoulder arthrogram: GI, glenoid version, coracohumeral interval, and rotator interval width/depth. Comparative analysis between the 2 groups was performed using the Student t test for each variable, followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine discriminative ability when statistically significant. Results: Overall, 55 participants (33 male and 22 female patients; mean age, 15.4 ± 2.1 years) were enrolled; 22 patients were in included in the dislocator group and 33 patients comprised the control group. The mean GI in the dislocator group was significantly greater than the control group (1.55 ± 0.14 vs. 1.38 ± 0.08; P <.001). ROC analysis revealed adequate discrimination of GI in predicting glenohumeral dislocation (area under the curve = 0.88). A GI ≥1.45 was 83% sensitive and 79% specific for predicting dislocation in the study cohort. Conclusion: Patients with anterior glenohumeral dislocation had increased GI (taller and narrower glenoid morphology) than controls. This useful MRI measurement may help identify patients at risk for primary or recurrent anterior glenohumeral instability events and may therefore help with guiding treatment and prevention.

N2  - Background: Scapular assessment is important in examining overhead athletes, but there is inconsistency in scapular clinical assessment and its relation to pathology. Purpose: To determine the relationship between clinical scapular assessment and biomechanical scapula resting position, shoulder strength, and pitching shoulder kinematics and kinetics. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Two clinicians performed scapular assessments and graded the scapula as presence or absence of scapular dyskinesis. Shoulder external rotation (ER) and internal rotation (IR) strength were collected. The 3-dimensional biomechanics of the scapula resting position (upward/downward rotation, IR/ER, and anterior/posterior tilt) were assessed while participants stood at rest, and pitching kinematics (maximum shoulder ER, shoulder abduction, shoulder horizontal abduction, shoulder rotation velocity) and kinetics (maximum shoulder distraction force) were assessed when participants pitched off the portable pitching mound that was engineered to meet major league specifications. Results: A total of 33 high school baseball pitchers (age, 16.3 ± 1.2 years; height, 184.0 ± 6.9 cm; weight, 76.8 ± 20.8 kg; hand dominance: left, 9 [27%]; right, 24 [73%]; pitch velocity, 34.7 ± 2.3 m/s) participated in this study. Of them, 15 participants had scapular dyskinesis, and 18 had normal scapulothoracic rhythm. No differences were observed for upward/downward rotation or anterior/posterior tilt, shoulder ER, shoulder abduction, or shoulder distraction force, based on the presence of scapular dyskinesis. Pitchers with scapular dyskinesis demonstrated significantly greater scapular resting IR position (effect size [ES], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.06 to 1.54; P =.020), greater nondominant shoulder ER to IR strength ratio (ES, 0.49; 95% CI, –0.02 to 1.00; P =.018), and decreased shoulder rotation velocity (ES, 14.66; 95% CI: 12.06 to 17.25; P =.016). Pitchers with greater anterior tilt demonstrated greater shoulder rotation velocity (r = –0.48; P =.006). Conclusion: Pitchers with scapular dyskinesis had greater scapular IR, greater nondominant shoulder ER to IR strength ratio, and reduced shoulder rotation velocity. Clinical Relevance: Scapular assessment may be more influenced by differential IR than upward rotation or anterior tilt. Scapular dyskinesis has no competitive performance advantage among amateur athletes. Greater understanding is needed to decipher the critical threshold between beneficial and maladaptive scapular movement patterns.

N2  - Background: Although surgical shoulder stabilization via coracoid transfer in collision athletes is effective and has a low reinjury rate, the factors affecting poor clinical results and the superiority of the 2 stabilization procedures (Bristow and Latarjet) remain unclear. Purpose: To explore the factor(s) affecting poor clinical results of coracoid transfer in a large cohort of rugby players and to compare postoperative function between the Bristow and Latarjet procedures. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This study included 169 consecutive shoulders of 154 competitive male rugby players who underwent shoulder stabilization surgery (Bankart repair with coracoid transfer) between 2014 and 2018 and had a mean follow-up of 2.7 years (minimum follow-up, 2 years). The Bristow procedure was performed in the first 92 shoulders (84 players), and the Latarjet procedure was performed in the latter 77 shoulders (70 players). A poor clinical result was defined as a postoperative Rowe score of <70 and a postoperative Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI) score of >630. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors affecting postoperative functional failure. The postoperative scores and complication rates were also compared between the 2 procedures. Results: In total, 92.3% of the rugby players returned to their preinjury competition level at a mean of 5.9 months postoperatively. The Rowe and WOSI scores showed that shoulder function was improved postoperatively compared with preoperatively. The number of rugby players with a poor clinical result was 18 (10.7%). Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a poor clinical result was associated with a preoperative glenoid bone defect of >20% of the glenoid width (odds ratio, 9.8), whereas the clinical result was unaffected by the type of coracoid transfer. There were no differences between the 2 procedures in any of the postoperative scores or complication rates. Conclusion: The present study indicated that the most effective predictor of postoperative functional scores was the degree of the glenoid bone defect and not the type of coracoid transfer. This information may be useful for the strategic treatment of shoulder dislocations in collision athletes.

N2  - Background: Ultrasound is an essential tool for diagnosing shoulder disorders. However, the role of ultrasound in assessing and diagnosing adhesive capsulitis has not been fully studied. Purpose: To evaluate the ultrasound features of adhesive capsulitis and estimate the correlations between clinical impairment and ultrasound parameters. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 61 patients with clinically diagnosed unilateral adhesive capsulitis were retrospectively reviewed using high-resolution ultrasound. To compare ultrasound parameters, we performed ultrasound examinations on both affected and unaffected shoulders. Ultrasound parameters, including thickness of the coracohumeral ligament (CHL), rotator interval (RI), axillary recess (AR), hypervascularity of the RI, and effusion of the long head of the biceps tendon sheath, were measured. Passive range of motion (PROM), visual analog scale for pain, and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index were used for clinical assessment. Results: The CHL, the RI, and the AR in affected shoulders were significantly thicker than in unaffected shoulders (P <.05). CHL thickness in affected shoulders was significantly correlated with PROM limitation, which included forward elevation, abduction, external rotation (ER), and internal rotation (IR) (P <.05). AR thickness correlated with passive forward elevation limitation and passive IR limitation (P <.05). The CHL was significantly thicker in stage 2 compared with stage 1, and the RI was thicker in stage 2 compared with stage 3. The diagnostic cutoff values for adhesive capsulitis were 2.2 mm for CHL thickness (77% sensitivity, 91.8% specificity) and 4 mm for AR thickness (68.9% sensitivity, 90.2% specificity). Conclusion: The ultrasound parameters associated with structural changes were correlated with clinical characteristics of adhesive capsulitis. Thickened CHL, RI, and AR were observed in affected shoulders. The cutoff values of 2.2 mm for CHL thickness and 4 mm for AR thickness can be used as cutoff diagnostic values for adhesive capsulitis.

N2  - Background: Horizontal instability following acute acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) reconstruction still occurs with a high prevalence. Although the human acromioclavicular ligament complex (ACLC) represents the major horizontal ACJ stabilizer, experimental studies on healing characteristics are lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this histological study was to investigate the healing potential of the ACLC following acute anatomical reconstruction Methods: In this prospective clinical-experimental study, 28 ACLC biopsies were performed in patients with complete ACJ dislocations (Rockwood type 4 or 5) during acute hook plate stabilization (IG: implantation group; n = 14) and hook plate removal (EG: explantation group; n = 14). Histological analyses included Giemsa staining, polarized light microscopy and immunostaining against CD68, αSMA and collagen type I and type III. Histomorphological evaluation entailed cell counts, collagen expression score, ligament tissue maturity index (LTMI) and descriptive analysis of specific ligamentous structures. Statistics consisted of nonparametric Mann–Whitney U tests and a level of significance of P <.05. Results: Total cell counts (cells/mm2 1491 ± 296 vs. 635 ± 430; P < 0.001) and collagen III expression (3.22 ± 0.22 vs. 1.78 ± 0.41; P < 0.001) were higher in EG compared to IG. Inversely αSMA + (11 ± 9 vs. 179 ± 186; P < 0.001) and CD68 + cell counts (56 ± 20 vs. 100 ± 57; P 0.009) were significantly lower in the EG. The EG revealed a comparable reorientation of ligamentous structures. Consistently, ACLC samples of the EG (21.6 ± 2.4) displayed a high total but differently composed LTMI score (IG: 24.5 ± 1.2; P < 0.001). Conclusions: This experimental study proved the ligamentous healing potential of the human ACLC following acute anatomical reconstruction. Histomorphologically, the ACLC reliably showed a ligamentous state of healing at a mean of about 12 weeks after surgery. However, processes of ligamentous remodeling were still evident. These experimental findings support recent clinical data showing superior horizontal ACJ stability with additional AC stabilization in the context of acute ACJ reconstruction. Though, prospective clinical and biomechanical studies are warranted to evaluate influencing factors on ACLC healing and potential impacts of acute ACLC repair on clinical outcome. Study type: Controlled Laboratory Study

N2  - Background: Traumatic anterior shoulder instability in collision sports athletes often involves osseous glenoid lesions, which make surgical treatment challenging. High redislocation rates have been seen in collision sports athletes treated using arthroscopic Bankart repair. Purpose: To investigate the effectiveness of a combined arthroscopic Bankart repair and open Bristow procedure for the treatment of traumatic anterior shoulder instability in collision sports athletes, with a focus on osseous glenoid lesions. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: We reviewed 149 shoulders in 141 competitive collision sports athletes (mean ± standard deviation age, 20.1 ± 4.1 years; 8 bilateral cases) who underwent a combined arthroscopic Bankart repair and open Bristow procedure with minimum 2 years of follow-up. Osseous Bankart lesions were arthroscopically reduced and fixed using a coracoid graft. Results: Clinical outcomes as indicated by mean Rowe score improved significantly from 50.0 preoperatively to 98.9 postoperatively (P <.001) at a median follow-up of 3.4 years (range, 2.5-7 years). There were 2 recurrent dislocations (1.3%), both of which had nonunion of the transferred coracoid. Osseous Bankart lesions were observed in 85 shoulders, and osseous glenoid lesions ≥10% of the diameter of the nonoperative side were found in 58 shoulders, including 24 off-track cases. Clinical outcomes were not significantly different between patients with a glenoid defect ≥10% and <10%. Nonunion of the transferred coracoid was observed in 16 shoulders (10.7%), which had inferior Rowe scores; however, we could not define any risk factors for nonunion, including patient characteristics or bone morphology. Postoperative computed tomography performed in 29 patients >1 year after surgery showed successful repair of the osseous glenoid lesions, with a restored glenoid articular surface in all cases. Significant pre- to postoperative increases were seen in glenoid diameter (mean, 13.1% [95% CI, 9.9%-16.3%]; P <.001) and area (mean, 10.6% [95% CI, 8.5%-12.7%]; P <.001). Conclusion: A combined arthroscopic Bankart repair and open Bristow procedure improved bone morphology and was a reliable surgical method for treating collision sports athletes with traumatic anterior shoulder instability involving osseous glenoid lesions.

N2  - Background: The glenoid track (GT) concept illustrates how the degree of glenoid bone loss and humeral bone loss in the glenohumeral joint can guide further treatment in a patient with anterior instability. The importance of determining which lesions are at risk for recurrent instability involves imaging of the glenohumeral joint, but no studies have determined which type of imaging is the most appropriate. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to determine the validity and accuracy of different imaging modalities for measuring the GT in shoulders with recurrent anterior instability. We hypothesized that 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) would be the most accurate imaging technique. Study Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines using PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and Cochrane libraries between database inception and July 2019. We included all clinical trials or cadaveric studies that evaluated imaging modalities for assessing the GT. Results: A total of 13 studies were included in this review: 1 study using 2-dimensional CT, 6 studies using 3D-CT, 4 studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 1 study using magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA)/MRI, and 1 study combining CT and MRI. The mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for 2D-CT was 92%, 100%, and 96%, respectively. For MRI, the means were 72.2%, 87.9%, and 84.2%, respectively. No papers included 3D-CT metrics. The mean intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for intraobserver reliability were 0.9046 for 3D-CT and 0.867 for MRI. ICCs for interobserver reliability were 0.8164, 0.8845, and 0.43 for 3D-CT, MRI, and MRA/MRI, respectively. Conclusion: There is evidence to support the use of both CT and MRI imaging modalities in assessing the GT. In addition, few studies have compared radiographic measurements with a gold standard, and even fewer have looked at the GT concept as a predictor of outcomes. Thus, future studies are needed to further evaluate which imaging modality is the most accurate to assess the GT.

N2  - Background: Recurrent shoulder instability may be associated with glenoid erosion and bone loss. Accurate quantification of bone loss significantly influences the contemplation of surgical procedure. In addition, assessment of bone loss is crucial for surgical planning and accurate graft placement during surgery. Purpose: To quantify the concave surface area of glenoid bone loss by using 3-dimensional (3D) segmented models of the scapula and to compare this method with the best-fit circle and glenoid height/width methods, which use the glenoid rim for bone loss estimations. Study Design: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 36 consecutive preoperative bilateral computed tomography scans of patients eligible for a primary Latarjet procedure were selected from our institutional surgical database (mean patient age, 29 ± 9 years; 31 men and 5 women). The 3D models of both scapulae were generated using medical segmentation software and were used to map the anatomic concave surface area (ACSA) of the inferior glenoid using the diameter of the best-fit circle of the healthy glenoid. Bone loss was calculated as a ratio of the difference between surface areas of both glenoids (healthy and pathological) against the anatomic circular surface area of the healthy glenoid (the ACSA method). These results were compared with bone loss calculations using the best-fit circle and glenoid height/width methods. Inter- and intraobserver reliability were also calculated. Results: The mean (± SD) bone loss calculated using the ACSA, the best-fit circle, and glenoid height/width methods was 9.4% ± 6.7%, 14.3% ± 6.8%, and 17.6% ± 7.3%, respectively. The ACSA method showed excellent interobserver reliability, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.95 versus those for the best-fit circle (ICC, 0.71) and glenoid height/width (ICC, 0.79) methods. Conclusion: Quantification of instability-related glenoid bone loss is reliable using the 3D ACSA method.

N2  - Background and purpose — Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is used for treating cuff arthropathy, displaced proximal humeral fractures (PHF), and in revision shoulder surgery, despite sparse evidence on long-term results. We assessed stability of the glenoid component in reverse TSA, using model-based RSA. Patients and methods — 20 patients (mean age 76 years, 17 female), operated on with reverse TSA at Oslo University Hospital, in 2015–2017 were included. Indications for surgeries were PHFs, malunion, cuff arthropathy, and chronic shoulder dislocation. RSA markers were placed in the scapular neck, the coracoid, and the acromion. RSA radiographs were conducted postoperatively, at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years. RSA analysis was performed using RSAcore with Reversed Engineering (RE) modality, with clinical precision < 0.25 mm for all translations (x, y, z) and < 0.7° for rotations (x, z). Scapular “notching” was assessed in conventional radiographs. Results — 1 patient was excluded due to revision surgery. More than half of the patients displayed measurable migration at 2 years: 6 patients with linear translations below 1 mm and 8 patients who showed rotational migration. Except for one outlier, the measured rotations were below 2°. The migration pattern suggested implant stability at 2 years. 10 patients showed radiolographic signs of “notching”, and the mean Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) at 2 years was 29 points (15–36 points). Interpretation — Stability analysis of the glenoid component of reversed total shoulder arthroplasty using reversed engineering (RE) model-based RSA indicated component stability at 2 years.

N2  - Ultrasonic imaging is a safe, established, and non-invasive method to visualise the locations of structures within the body. Coupling existing skin mounted motion capture markers to ultrasound sensors could allow for precise measurement of positions and orientations of bones hidden under the skin, mitigating the effects of relative displacement between skin and bone that occurs in standard motion capture techniques. This is especially important in motions where skin-mounted markers are inaccurate, such as when tracking scapular position while shoulder abduction is greater than 80 degrees. Previous in silico research has shown that five ultrasound-coupled motion capture clusters could provide sub-millimetre levels of scapular RMS error. This study builds upon those results. The position of a scapular phantom measured by the motion capture plus ultrasound (MC+U) technique was compared to the phantom position as quantified by CT. The root mean squared measurement error in overall scapular position was (Formula presented.). Mean translational and rotational errors were 0.74 mm and 0.42°, respectively. This level of accuracy would make MC+U a valuable new tool for quantifying scapular position and motion in vivo. The results of this study confirm that the further development of the MC+U technique is warranted and establish a reasonable target for the accuracy of this technique for future in vivo studies.

N2  - Glenoid component loosening remains a common complication following anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA); however, plain radiographs are unable to accurately detect early implant migration. The purpose of this study was to validate the accuracy of a method of postoperative, three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) imaging with metal artifact reduction (MAR) to detect glenoid component migration following anatomic TSA. Tantalum bead markers were inserted into polyethylene glenoid components for implant detection on 3D CT. In-vitro validation was performed using a glenoid component placed into a scapula sawbone and incrementally translated and rotated, with MAR 3D CT acquired at each test position. Accuracy was evaluated by root mean square error (RMSE). In-vivo validation was performed on six patients who underwent anatomic TSA, with two postoperative CT scans acquired in each patient and marker-based radiostereometric analysis (RSA) performed on the same days. Glenoid component migration was calculated relative to a scapular coordinate system for both MAR 3D CT and RSA. Accuracy was evaluated by RMSE and paired Student's t-tests. The largest RMSE on in-vitro testing was 0.24 mm in translation and 0.11° in rotation, and on in-vivo testing was 0.47 mm in translation and 1.04° in rotation. There were no significant differences between MAR 3D CT and RSA measurement methods. MAR 3D CT imaging is capable of quantifying glenoid component migration with a high level of accuracy. MAR 3D CT imaging is advantageous over RSA because it is readily available clinically and can also be used to evaluate the implant-bone interface.

N2  - Background: A “double-pulley” dual-row technique had been applied for arthroscopic fixation of large bony Bankart lesion in which the fragment has a wide base. Purpose: To investigate clinical outcomes and glenoid healing after arthroscopic fixation of bony Bankart lesion using the double-pulley dual-row technique. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 25 patients were included in this retrospective study. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, pain visual analog scale (VAS) score, and range of motion of the affected shoulder were assessed. Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans (preoperatively, immediately after surgery, and at 1 year postoperatively) were performed to evaluate arthritic changes (Samilson-Prieto classification) and glenoid size. The intraobserver reliability of the CT measurements was analyzed. Results: At a mean follow-up of 3.4 years, the mean ASES and VAS scores were 94.87 ± 5.02 and 0.48 ± 0.59, respectively. Active forward elevation, external rotation with the arm at the side, and internal rotation were 165.80° ± 11.70°, 33.20° ± 8.02°, and T9 (range, T6-S1), respectively. No patient reported a history of redislocation or instability. The intraobserver reliability of the CT measurements was moderate to excellent. The mean preoperative size of the bony fragment was measured as 23.4% ± 7.8% of the glenoid articular surface. The quality of the reduction was judged to be excellent in 13 (52%) cases, good in 8 (32%), and fair in 4 (16%). The mean immediate postoperative glenoid size was 96.8% ± 4.3%, and bone union was found in all cases. There were no significant differences between reconstructed and immediate postoperative glenoid size or between preoperative and final Samilson-Prieto grades. Conclusion: The arthroscopic double-pulley method was a reliable technique for the fixation of large bony Bankart lesions with a wide base. Satisfactory results can be expected regarding the restoration of the glenoid morphology and stability of the shoulder. High healing rate and good shoulder function can be achieved. No radiological evidence of cartilage damage caused by suture abrasion was found at 2- to 5-year follow-up.

N2  - Background: Scapular notching is a radiographic finding associated with the use of a reverse shoulder prosthesis. The morphological characteristics of the glenoid neck have been scarcely explored as a relevant factor in relation to scapular notching. The objective of this study is to measure the length of the glenoid neck in a three-dimensional CT reconstruction of a healthy population and to simulate the scapular notching free range of motion for the “long neck” and for the “short neck” groups. Methods: CT scans of 214 shoulders were reviewed, excluding incomplete, poor quality, or altered studies. 100 CT scans were finally processed. The mean age was 51.7 years (SD 19.4; range, 15–84 years), with 49 female and 51 male patients. For each of the scapulae, four morphometric measurements were obtained: anterior glenoid neck (AGN), middle glenoid neck (MGN), posterior glenoid neck (PGN) and alternative posterior glenoid neck (aPGN). Using 3D software, we simulated a reverse shoulder prosthesis, and the scapular notching free range of motion was registered. Differences between measurements were evaluated with an unpaired t-test using StataIC16®. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. The intraobserver and interobserver correlation was evaluated with the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results: The AGN measured 7.43 ± 2.52 mm (range, 1.72–13.3 mm); MGN measured 8.05 mm ± 1.93 (range, 2.92–13.2 mm); PGN measured 7.26 ± 2.6 mm (range, 2–13.4 mm); and aPGN measured 8.97 ± 2.3 mm (range, 4.08–15.4 mm). The scapular notching free range of motion for the “long neck” group was 74.98° ± 7.35 (range, 55–83°) and for the “short neck” group, it was 62.93° ± 6.84 (range, 45–70°) (p = 0.0004). Conclusions: Measurement of posterior glenoid neck length exhibits excellent reliability and reproducibility, as well as being associated to the scapular notching free range of motion. Study design: Basic, retrospective, CT images research.

N2  - Accurate pin placement to guide renaming of the glenoid surface in total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is a critical step to restore range of motion in the glenohumeral joint. Achieving proper pin position with free-hand is complicated due to inadequate intra-operative availability of pre-operative planning data. Mixed reality provides a new modality of surgical navigation for arthroplasty without distracting surgeon from the patient anatomy. However, achieving accurate alignment between the pre-operative plan and the intra-operative anatomy is challenging, especially if workflow-compliant solutions are desired. In this paper, we present a calibration-free mixed reality navigation workflow for glenoid pin placement in TSA that contributes to solving some open challenges. We use a visible light stereo camera on a surgical support arm combined with a transformer-based disparity estimation algorithm to accurately reconstruct the 3D anatomy despite surgical lighting. Besides, we introduce a slide-on marker calibrated by design to overcome perceptual difficulties that arise when trying to align real to virtual objects. In a user study on a semi-anthropomorphic phantom, we assess the end-to-end pin placement accuracy using both our system and a clinical reference standard solution that relies on patient-specific drill guides. Averaging over 15 drilled trajectories, our mixed reality system achieved a pin placement accuracy of ((Formula presented.) mm, (Formula presented.)).

N2  - Ultrasound is a fast, accessible, reliable, and radiation-free imaging modality routinely used to assess the soft tissues around the shoulder. It enables to identify a wide range of pathological conditions. Furthermore, most ultrasound-guided musculoskeletal interventional procedures around the shoulder produce better results in terms of accuracy and clinical efficacy than those performed in a blinded fashion. Indeed, intra-articular and peri-articular interventional procedures can be easily performed under continuous ultrasound monitoring to ensure the correct position of the needle and to deliver the medication to a specific target. Several technical approaches and medications can be used to treat different causes of painful shoulder. Intra-articular injections are applied to treat acromioclavicular osteoarthritis as well as glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis and adhesive capsulitis. Subacromialsubdeltoid bursitis, either presenting as a primary inflammatory condition or secondary to rotator cuff disorders, can be easily approached using ultrasound guidance to aspirate synovial effusion and to inject medications. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous irrigation is a well-established technique increasingly applied to treat patients with rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy. Also, degenerative rotator cuff tendinopathy can be conservatively treated by image-guided interventions, specifically with needling under ultrasound guidance that can be associated with injections of platelet-rich plasma. Lastly, periarticular peripheral nerve block can be quickly and safely performed under ultrasound guidance, particularly in conditions involving the suprascapular nerve in the setting of pre-operative analgesia or pain treatment in glenohumeral osteoarthritis and adhesive capsulitis. In this article, the most common ultrasound-guided procedures around the shoulder have been reviewed to discuss indications and techniques.

N2  - Introduction: Post-traumatic lesions of the carpus (scapholunate rupture, scaphoid non-union) frequently evolve into disabling osteoarthritis (scapholunate advanced collapse or scaphoid non-union advanced collapse: SLAC or SNAC wrist). Proximal row carpectomy (PRC) is a reliable option but with poorer prognosis in case of osteoarthritis of the distal radius or capitate head. In such situations, radiocarpal arthrodesis may be necessary, sacrificing wrist motion. To circumvent this limitation, we propose a new procedure consisting in arthroscopic PRC and replacing the proximal row by tendon graft. Methods: This was a study on 16 cadaver specimens. A scapholunate pin was introduced via an approach into the anatomical snuffbox and used as a guide for a cannulated drill bit (9 mm) to create a tunnel through the proximal row. The arthroscope and a reamer were introduced into the tunnel via its radial and ulnar ends. PRC was performed under arthroscopic control. The gracilis and semitendinosus tendons were harvested and folded so as to obtain a graft with the same length and diameter as the proximal row. The graft was threaded through the radial approach and fixed to the capsule. Results: Mean procedure time was 68 min. There was no pre- to postoperative difference in joint motion or carpal height. On radiocinematography, the graft was stable between the radius and the second row of the carpus. The radial and ulnar sensory branches, median nerve and radial artery were intact at end of procedure. Discussion: This technique could be a solution in SLAC or SNAC wrist with osteoarthritis of the capitate head or radial glenoid. It also conserves carpal height. Being arthroscopic, the procedure avoids the major edema observed after a dorsal approach of the carpus, and also ensures graft stability, since the radiocarpal ligaments are conserved. Harvesting from a second anatomical site and the in vivo fate of the transplant are two issues that need to be discussed. Conclusion: This anatomical study paves the way for clinical experimentation. Level of evidence: IV.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) after prior shoulder stabilization versus matched cohorts without previous stabilization surgery. Hypotheses were as follows: (1) patients undergoing aTSA or rTSA after stabilization procedures would have worse outcomes than matched cohorts and (2) patients undergoing TSA would have better outcomes after soft-tissue stabilization procedures (aTSAST or rTSAST) than after bony stabilization procedures (aTSAB or rTSAB). Methods: Retrospective cohort study was performed comparing (1) 36 patients who underwent aTSA and (2) 32 patients who underwent rTSA with prior shoulder stabilization with 3-to-1 matched cohorts (based on age, gender, and follow-up length) with no prior shoulder instability or surgery. Baseline demographics, perioperative data, adverse events (AEs), radiographic outcomes, functional outcome scores, range of motion (ROM), and patient satisfaction were analyzed. Subgroup analyses compared patients who underwent aTSAST or rTSAST with patients who underwent aTSAB or rTSAB. Results: The postoperative AE rate was 8.3% and 4.6% in the aTSA group and matched cohort, respectively (P =.404), with a trend toward a significantly higher incidence of aseptic glenoid loosening in the aTSA group (8.3% vs. 1.9%, P =.067). Functional outcomes, ROM, and patient satisfaction did not differ at follow-up >4 years. In the subgroup analysis, two AEs required reoperation among 25 patients who underwent aTSAST versus one among 11 patients who underwent aTSAB, all related to aseptic loosening. There was a trend toward greater functional outcomes and satisfaction among patients who underwent aTSAST. There was a trend toward a clinically significant difference in active abduction at final follow-up favoring aTSAST (128 vs. 108 degrees, P =.096). The postoperative AE rate was 6.3% and 4.2% among the rTSA group and matched cohort, respectively (P =.632). Functional outcomes, ROM, and patient satisfaction did not differ at 4-year follow-up. In the subgroup analysis, no AEs were reported among 18 patients who underwent rTSAST and 14 patients who underwent rTSAB. A trend toward greater functional outcomes and patient satisfaction favored patients who underwent rTSAB, who achieved greater improvements in ROM from baseline and greater ROM in all planes at the final follow-up. Conclusion: Both aTSA and rTSA are reliable options for the treatment of dislocation arthropathy in appropriately selected patients. aTSA and rTSA after prior shoulder stabilization procedures have nearly equal rates of AEs and yield similar clinical and functional outcomes as matched cohorts. There may be an increased risk of glenoid aseptic loosening in aTSA after prior shoulder stabilization. Functional outcomes tend to be greater for patients who underwent aTSAST than those for patients who underwent aTSAB. On the contrary, rTSA may optimize postoperative function when performed for dislocation arthropathy after bony rather than soft-tissue stabilization procedures.

N2  - Background: Custom-made three dimensional–printed glenoid implants for reverse shoulder arthroplasty are a modern treatment option for severe glenoid bone deficiencies. The potential advantages of not only achieving primary stability but also being able to realize the preoperative plan in terms of implantation accuracy at the same time have not yet been sufficiently investigated. The purpose of this study was to quantify the implantation precision of custom-made glenoid implants. Methods: Twelve consecutive patients with severe glenoid bone defects were treated between May 2019 and August 2020 using a custom-made glenoid implant (ProMade) (LimaCorporate, San Daniele, Italy) with reverse shoulder arthroplasty at a single hospital. All patients were eligible for inclusion and could be enrolled in this institutional review board–approved study. The immediate postoperative computer tomography–evaluated position of the glenoid implant was compared with the preoperative computer-based plan, on which the manufacturing process was based. As a result of this comparison, deviation measurements in six degrees of freedom (inclination, version, mediolateral offset, anteroposterior offset, superoinferior offset, and roll rotation) emerged. Results: The absolute average (mean value ± standard deviation) implantation deviation related to the plan was 1.6° ± 5.4° for version, 1.9° ± 4.1° for inclination, 0.3 mm ± 3.3 mm for mediolateral offset, 0.1 mm ± 1.9 mm for anteroposterior offset, 0.0 mm ± 2.4 mm for superoinferior offset, and 1.0° ± 6.3° for roll rotation. The augment volume averaged 9.0 cm³ ± 2.6 cm³. All custom-made glenoid implants were implanted with a subjectively sufficient primary stability. Conclusion: This study gives an indication that custom-made three dimensional–printed glenoid implants can be implanted with statistically high accuracy. To evaluate the clinical benefit and radiographic stability, a longer follow-up investigation is needed.

N2  - Сervical dystonia (CD) is the most common type of focal dystonia (up to 50% of all dystonia cases). Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injections is the treatment choice for CD. However, the effectiveness and tolerability of botulinum therapy in CD depends on the correct choice of target muscles and the accuracy of the BoNT injection. The publication presents literature data and our own clinical experience regarding the use of navigation in BoNT injections in CD. According to the majority of authors, the use of navigation equipment, such as ultrasound (US) and electromyography (EMG), definitely increases the effectiveness of CD treatment and reduces the likelihood of adverse events. For the first time, an algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of CD is proposed, based on the use of the method of «double- (EMG and US) guided navigation», a variant for determining the comparative activity of muscles by the intensity of the EMG signal and the design of an individual «passport» of the CD. The possibilities of analyzing the US of muscles, drawing up an accurate treatment regimen, targeted administration of BoNT, and using a non-injectable EMG electrode are shown. We present 4 clinical cases demonstrating the advantages of the double- (EMG+US) guided navigation method over the EMG-guided navigation for injection. The proposed algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of CD makes it possible to increase the effectiveness of treatment, optimize the costs of BoNT and diagnostic equipment (injection EMG needle).

N2  - The biomechanical complexity of the human shoulder, while critical for functionality, poses a challenge for objective assessment during sensorimotor rehabilitation. With built-in sensing capabilities, robotic exoskeletons have the potential to serve as tools for both intervention and assessment. The bilateral upper-extremity Harmony exoskeleton is capable of full shoulder articulation, forearm flexion-extension, and wrist pronation-supination motions. The goal of this paper is to characterize Harmony's anatomical joint angle tracking accuracy towards its use as an assessment tool. We evaluated the agreement between anatomical joint angles estimated from the robot's sensor data and optical motion capture markers attached to the human user. In 9 healthy participants we examined 6 upper-extremity joint angles, including shoulder girdle angles, across 4 different motions, varying active/passive motion of the user and physical constraint of the trunk. We observed mostly good to excellent levels of agreement between measurement systems with $\textit {CMC}_{\textit {ip}} \,\, {>} \,\, {0.65}$ for shoulder and distal joints, magnitudes of average discrepancies varying from 0.43° to 16.03° and width of LoAs ranging between 9.44° and 41.91°. Slopes were between 1.03 and 1.43 with r > 0.9 for shoulder and distal joints. Regression analysis suggested that discrepancies observed between measured robot and human motions were primarily due to relative motion associated with soft tissue deformation. The results suggest that the Harmony exoskeleton is capable of providing accurate measurements of arm and shoulder joint kinematics. These findings may lead to robot-assisted assessment and intervention of one of the most complex joint structures in the human body.

N2  - BACKGROUD: Reliable scapular upward rotation and anterior-posterior tilt data are required for patients with subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS). Only a few studies have explored the reliability of such measurements derived using a modified inclinometer. OBJECTIVES: To determine the relative and absolute reliability of scapular upward rotation and anterior-posterior tilt measurements derived using a modified digital inclinometer in patients with SIS. METHOD: Seventeen SIS patients were assessed twice within 1 week. We determined the relative and absolute measurement reliability by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), and minimal clinically important difference (MCID). Both intra- and interrater reliability were determined. RESULTS: The intra-rater reliability (both measurements) was high (0.72-0.88), and the interrater ICC was high to excellent (0.72-0.98). Clinically acceptable SEM and MCID values were obtained for scapular upward rotation (SEM: 4.28-9.33°, MCID: 5.1-11.3°) and anterior-posterior tilt (SEM: 3.72-7.55°, MCID: 2.5-10.8°). CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of scapular upward rotation and anterior-posterior tilt using a modified digital inclinometer reliably reveal scapular position and kinematics in patients with SIS.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Paralabral cysts are a rare cause of shoulder pain. Linear ultrasound transducers are often used for musculoskeletal evaluation and intervention. However, the use of linear transducer is limited when the target structure is located deep and blocked by bony barriers, as is the case of paralabral ganglion cysts. OBJECTIVE: This case report aims to describe a beneficial role of using a convex transducer on the evaluation and ultrasonography-guided intervention of paralabral cysts below the acromion. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients visiting the outpatient clinic of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation complained of severe pain during shoulder movement. Ultrasound scans with linear transducer detected rotator cuff lesions. Shoulder magnetic resonance imaging was done because of the persistent pain despite therapeutic interventions for the rotator cuff lesion, and confirmed paralabral cysts. Although a linear array transducer could not visualize the cystic lesion but could only perform suprascapular nerve block and intra-articular injection, the use of a convex array transducer improved the visualization of the cystic lesion which we treated using ultrasound-guided aspiration and intra-cystic injection. Visual analog scale and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index were checked to assess the treatment effect of each intervention. The intra-cystic injection with aspiration and intra-articular injection showed minimal to moderate improvement of pain score. CONCLUSION: In pain related to shoulder movement, especially pain that continues despite appropriate treatment for rotator cuff lesions, ultrasound diagnosis of paralabral ganglion cysts using convex transducers will improve the diagnostic value and accuracy of intervention.

N2  - Introduction Degenerative acromioclavicular joint pain accounts for about 4% of shoulder pain. Various medical and non-medical treatment strategies are available for acromioclavicular joint disease but it is difficult to conduct a comparative evaluation of these treatments. The few studies dealing with the medical management of the disease have conducted no comparative assessment of drug therapies, physiotherapy, joint manipulation and corticosteroid injections. The primary goal of this study is to determine whether manual therapy is not inferior to ultrasound-guided injection of a corticosteroid preparation to decrease acromiocalvicular joint pain at 3 months. Methods and analysis The acromioclavicular arthropathy managed by manual therapy is a monocentric, comparative, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority study conducted in the Rheumatology Department of Vendée Departmental Hospital, involving two parallel groups receiving either corticosteroid injections or manual therapy. The inclusion criteria are patients who suffer from pain in the shoulder or the proximal part of the arm, with pain located on palpation of the acromioclavicular joint associated with a positive cross-arm test and a positive O'Brien test. Randomisation will be at a 1:1 ratio. The injection group will receive a single ultrasound-guided injection of 1 mL of Diprostène and the manual therapy group will receive between one and three sessions at intervals of one per week. The primary outcome will be to compare the Visual Analogue Scale for pain-activity-related score at 3 months for both groups. Ethics and dissemination The study project has been approved by the appropriate ethics committee (Committee for the Protection of Patients Ouest II in Angers, 30 April 2019, with the registration number of 2019/22). In agreement with current French regulations, signed informed written consent will be obtained from each patient. Results of the main trial and of the secondary endpoints will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Trial registration number NCT03951480.

N2  - Background: Postural control has been associated with the functional impairment in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). However, there is a need for reliable methods to assess postural control in early stages of the disease, when subtle changes can be difficult to detect. The aims of this study were to assess the absolute and relative reliability of a standing and a sitting posturographic protocol in minimally (Expanded Disability Status Scale ≤ 2) and moderately (2.5 ≤ Expanded Disability Status Scale ≤ 4) impaired pwMS, and to analyze relationships among postural control and functional mobility and gait performance. Methods: To assess postural control in an upright stance, 14 minimally and 16 moderately impaired pwMS performed six 70 s trials in tandem stance, 3 with their weaker leg behind (TSWL) and 3 with their stronger leg behind (TSSL). Additionally, participants completed five 70 s trials using an unstable sitting protocol (US) to assess trunk stability. The mean radial errors of TSWL, TSSL, and US trials were calculated as postural control indexes. Furthermore, participants performed the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and the Timed 25-foot Walk test (T25FW) to measure their functional mobility and gait speed, respectively. Reliability was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC3,1) and the standard error of measurement (SEM). Analyses of variances were carried out to assess between-group differences. Hedges’ g index (dg) was used to estimate the effect size of differences. Pearson correlation analyses (r) were performed to examine the relationships among the postural control and the functional tests. Results: Posturographic tests showed a high reliability in both minimally (0.87 ≤ ICC ≤ 0.92; 9.32% ≤ SEM ≤ 11.76%) and moderately (0.80 ≤ ICC ≤ 0.92; 10.33% ≤ SEM ≤ 15.33%) impaired pwMS. Similarly, T25FW and TUG displayed a high consistency in minimally (0.89 ≤ ICC ≤ 0.94; 3.43% ≤ SEM ≤ 5.17%) and moderately (0.85 ≤ ICC ≤ 0.93; 5.57% ≤ SEM ≤ 6.56%) impaired individuals. Minimally impaired pwMS showed a better performance on the TUG, T25FW, and TSWL than moderately impaired individuals (p < 0.05; dg ≥ 0.8). The TSWL, TSSL, and US variables correlated with TUG scores (0.419 ≤ r ≤ 0.604; p < 0.05), but TSWL also correlated with T25FW scores (r = 0.53; p < 0.01). Furthermore, US scores correlated with both tandem stance parameters (TSWL: r = 0.54, p < 0.01; TSSL: r = 0.43, p < 0.05). Conclusion: Tandem and sitting posturographic tests provide reliable measures of postural control in pwMS, even in individuals with a homogeneous disease profile. Gait speed, functional mobility, and weaker leg status seem decisive in assessing the degree of physical activity limitation in pwMS. Finally, although trunk stability does not seem to be so affected by the course of the disease, it remains relevant for postural control and functional capacity.

N2  - Purpose: The gracilis tendon (GT) is a commonly used autologous graft in Orthopaedic surgery. The majority of information on knee function and outcomes after hamstring harvest is related to both semitendinosus and GT harvest. Little is known regarding isolated harvest of a GT. It was hypothesized that isolated GT harvest would lead to altered gait patterns (e.g. augmented anterior-posterior translation or rotation in the tibiofemoral joint) and consequently a higher prevalence of cartilage lesions and meniscal tears in knees. Methods: GT harvesting was performed on patients with chronic acromioclavicular joint instability without previous knee injuries or surgeries. MRI of both knees and thighs were performed. Knee MRI were evaluated using the Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS). Inter- and intraobserver reliabilities, cross-sectional areas of different muscles, fatty infiltration of the gracilis muscle (GM) and GT regeneration were evaluated. The contralateral limb served as reference. The observers were blinded towards the identity of the patients and the operatively treated side. Results: After a mean time of 44 months after surgery testing was performed on 12 patients. No significant side-to-side differences were found using WORMS, although there was a trend towards increased cartilage lesions after GT harvest (median healthy knee 4.8 and GT harvested knee 7.8 p = 0.086). Inter- and intraobserver repeatability was high with 0.899 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.708–0.960) and 0.988 (95% CI 0.973–0.995), respectively. A significant hypotrophy of the GM with a mean decrease of 25.3%, 18.4% and 16.9% occurred at 25% (p = 0.016), 50% (p = 0.007) and 75% (p = 0.002) of the length of the femur from distal. No compensatory hypertrophy of other thigh muscles or increased fatty infiltration of the GM was found. Tendon regeneration took place in eight out of 12 patients. In case of regeneration, the regenerated tendon inserted in a more proximal place. Conclusion: Isolated harvest of the GT for shoulder procedures did not affect knee MRI significantly indicating therefore in general suitable graft utilization for surgeries outside of the knee. GT regenerated in most patients with just a more proximal insertion and a hypotrophy of the muscle belly.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the intra and interobserver reproducibility of a new system that assesses the three-dimensional humero-scapulo-thoracic kinematics using wearable technology in an outpatient setting. To obtain normative data with the system for scapular angular motions in three planes. Methods: The SHoW Motion 3D kinematic tracking system is a motion analysis system that uses wireless wearable non-invasive inertial-magnetic sensors to assess the three-dimensional kinematics of the shoulder girdle. The sensors are placed over the skin in the sternum, scapular spine and arm to precisely define angular motions of the humerus and the scapula with three Degrees of Freedom (DOF) for each segment. The system was used to measure the scapular angular motions in three planes (upward/downward rotation, internal/external rotation and anterior/posterior tilt) during two shoulder full-range movements (flexion/extension and abduction/abduction) in both shoulders of 25 healthy volunteers (13 males and 12 females, mean age: 37 [standard deviation 11.1] years). In a first measuring session one examiner made two evaluations alternating with another examiner that made a third evaluation. In a second session, one week apart, the first examiner made a fourth evaluation. A mean curve was computed from the normalized data for each measurement to obtain normative data for scapular angular kinematics. Intra and inter-observer reproducibility was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error Estimation (RMSE) and Coefficients for Multiple Correlations (CMC). Results: Both shoulders of the 25 volunteers were evaluated four times. The two hundred resulting kinematic analyses were pooled to get normative values for relations between humeral elevation angles and the three angular movements of the scapula. The system showed at least very good (CMC > 0.90) intra and inter-observer reproducibility for scapular tilt and upward-downward rotations both in flexion and abduction. For scapular internal-external rotation the results were acceptable (CMC > 0.75) but not as good, especially for the abduction movement. RMSE calculations showed consistently good reproducibility with RSME< 4° for all three angles evaluated in flexion and abduction. Conclusion: The SHoW Motion 3D kinematic tracking system is a quick, reproducible and easy to use system for the assessment of scapular angular kinematics in healthy adults. The data obtained is similar to that obtained with other validated methods. Level of evidence: Level II. Clinical relevance: The presented system is portable, easy to use and fast. It also has good intra and inter-observer reproducibility, making it a good tool to assess objectively scapular dyskinesis in the clinical setting. The normative data obtained is consistent with previous information available.

N2  - Study design: Cohort study. Objectives: Shoulder pain prevalence is high in those with spinal cord injury (SCI) and is associated with decreased function, participation restrictions and decreased quality of life. Limited evidence exists regarding physical impairments of newly acquired SCI. The current study compared musculoskeletal factors at rehabilitation initiation in individuals with newly acquired SCI to uninjured individuals. We hypothesized no impairment differences of shoulder pain, strength, mobility, muscle extensibility, or rotator cuff integrity would exist between groups. Setting: Multi-site laboratory setting. Methods: Thirty-five individuals with newly acquired SCI and age and gender-matched controls without SCI (n = 34) participated. Musculoskeletal Pain Survey, shoulder range of motion (ROM), strength, pectoralis minor muscle extensibility (PM) and tissue integrity [Ultrasound Pathology Rating Scale (USPRS)] were obtained. Results: Higher pain was reported by individuals experiencing new SCI along with lower strength across all bilateral measures, reduced elevation, external rotation, and horizontal adduction ROM, with large effect sizes. PM bilateral extensibility was reduced compared to controls, with moderate between group effect size; however, no USPRS score difference existed. Conclusions: This study provided the first comprehensive clinical description for individuals with newly acquired SCI. In comparison to matched uninjured controls, participants with new SCI reported greater shoulder pain with impairments in mobility, strength, and extensibility. The identified early clinical impairments aligned with progressive impairment including further pain development and persistence. Awareness and modification of these early clinical impairments may lead to improved long-term outcomes, improving the overall health and well-being of individuals with newly acquired SCI.

N2  - Background: Preoperative diagnosis of long thoracic nerve (LTN) palsy is important for shoulder reconstruction after a traumatic brachial plexus injury (BPI). In the present study, we developed an objective diagnostic method for LTN palsy for patients with traumatic BPI. Methods: This is a retrospective review of 56 patients with traumatic BPI who had been receiving treatment at a single institution for over 8 years. The patients were divided into 2 groups: an LTN palsy group (n = 30) and a no palsy control group (n = 26). The LTN palsy group had 21 different palsy types with 4 and 5 C5-7 and C5-8, whereas the no palsy group had 18 different palsy types with 5 and 3 C5-6 and C5-8, respectively. Preoperative plain anteroposterior radiographs were taken in shoulder adduction and shrug positions. Scapulothoracic (ST) upward rotation and clavicle lateral (CL) rotation angles were measured on X-rays. The differences between the adduction and shrug positions for the respective angles were calculated and defined as ΦST and ΦCL, respectively. The differences in the ΦST and ΦCL values due to the presence or absence of LTN palsy were examined, the cutoff values of ΦST and ΦCL for the diagnosis of LTN palsy were determined, and further sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results: Both ΦST and ΦCL were significantly decreased in the LTN palsy group compared with the no palsy control group. The sensitivity and specificity for LTN palsy were 0.833 and 1.000 for ΦST and 0.833 and 0.840 for ΦCL, respectively, when the cutoff value was set as ΦST = 15° and ΦCL ≤ 24°. Conclusion: Dynamic shrug radiographs provide a useful objective diagnosis of LTN palsy after traumatic BPI.

N2  - Introduction: Conventional radiography using an anteroposterior view of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint is the gold standard for evaluating arthritic degeneration. Objective: Based on a standardised AP view of the AC joint, the objective of this study was to determine whether this radiographic view is reliable and reproducible for evaluating the AC joint space. Methods: A cadaver scapula–clavicle unit, free of osteoarthritis, was used for this study. The scapula was positioned in a stand; and then with fluoroscopy guidance, a strict AP view of the AC joint was taken. Starting from this “0” position, a radiograph was taken by varying the angle by 5°, 10°, and 15° in every plane in space. All radiographs were taken during a single session to ensure the distance between the X-ray tube and scapula did not change. The images were then exported to OsiriX for processing; the superior and inferior AC distance and the joint area were measured. Results: There was no reproducibility in the AC joint measurements as a function of the incidence angle relative to a strict AP view. Conclusion: Conventional radiography using an AP view of the AC joint cannot be used to do a fine analysis of arthritic degeneration of this joint. It is likely that only CT scan or MRI is sufficient to analyse osteoarthritis in this joint. Level of evidence: IV, basic science study.

N2  - Background: In reverse shoulder arthroplasties (RSA), osseous in-growth is promoted if glenoid micromotion does not exceed 150 μm. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the configuration of central fixation for RSA glenoid baseplates reduces implant micromotion or changes scapula bone stresses. Methods: Using finite element analysis, glenoid baseplate fixation was tested in a cohort of 3 male and 2 female patients who were to undergo RSA. Computer models were created for 3 different RSA glenoid baseplate and 84 glenosphere designs, a central threaded peg (1 variant, D-TP), a central unthreaded peg (2 variants, I- 85 P(15) and I-P(25)), and a central peg with a screw (2 variants, A-PS and I-PS). A compressive and shear force of 756 N was distributed across the glenosphere with the scapula anchored. Results: Displacement was within 20-130 μm at the glenosphere baseplate-bone interface for all baseplates. The glenospheres with unthreaded pegs had intermediate displacement values (I-P(15): median, 89 μm; range, 32-112 μm; and I-P(25): median, 93 μm; range, 31-109 μm). The von Mises stresses were 1.8-7.0 MPa within cortical bone and 0.6-1.6 MPa within trabecular bone. Cortical bone stresses were similar with unthreaded pegs (I-P(15): median, 4.2 MPa; range, 1.8-6.0 MPa; and I-P(25): median, 4.2 MPa; range, 1.8-6.1 MPa), whereas mean trabecular stresses were similar for all configurations. Conclusions: All configurations yielded adequate stability, with micromotions being below 150 μm. The unthreaded pegged designs provided a valid alternative to the stable threaded pegged convex baseplates in terms of micromotions and bone stresses.

N2  - Background: Glenohumeral instability is a common condition of the shoulder. Glenoid bone loss and humeral head bone loss are well recognized as risk factors for recurrent instability. There are few studies in the literature that examine the role of coracoacromial arch anatomy in the pathogenesis of glenohumeral instability. Previous reports found an association between posterior acromial coverage (PAC) and posterior instability. We hypothesize that coracoacromial arch anatomy is related to anterior shoulder instability. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 50 patients with unidirectional anterior shoulder instability were matched to a control group of 50 glenohumeral arthritis patients without any history of shoulder instability. Radiographic measurements of the coracoacromial arch anatomy were made: shoulder arch angle, scapular Y angle, anterior coracoid tilt (ACT), posterior acromial tilt, anterior acromial coverage angle, PAC angle, coracoid height, posterior acromial height, and critical shoulder angle were determined using standard lateral scapular and anteroposterior radiographs. Results: Logistic regression analyses found a significant association between the presence of anterior instability and flatter coracoacromial arch angles (mean, 124.1°) vs. the arthritis control group (mean, 120.6°) (odds ratios [OR] = 1.113; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.039-1.191; P =.002). There was a significant association between anterior instability and ACT (OR = 1.144; 95% CI = 1.053-1.243; P =.001), whereas a negative association was found between anterior instability and PAC (OR = 0.909; 95% CI = 0.853-0.969; P =.004) and posterior acromial tilt (OR = 0.878; 95% CI = 0.773-0.998; P =.046). Lower critical shoulder angle values were associated with the arthritis group (28.2° vs. 33.9°) (OR = 1.555; 95% CI = 1.202-2.012; P =.001). Conclusions: Shoulder coracoacromial arch morphology may play a role in the stability of the shoulder joint and development of recurrent anterior instability. Shoulders with a decreased shoulder arch angle, a less contained and flatter coracoacromial arch and larger ACT, were associated with anterior instability. This study identifies the shoulder coracoacromial arch angle and anterior coracoid tile angles as risk factors for anterior shoulder instability. Our findings suggest that measuring these angles may help orthopedic surgeons understand the risk of anterior instability and analyze risk factors to improve clinical decision making.

N2  - Background: To address the need for more objective and quantitative measures of tendon healing in research studies, we intend to use computed tomography (CT) with implanted radiopaque markers on the repaired tendon to measure tendon retraction following rotator cuff repair. In our small prior study, retraction at 1-year follow-up averaged 16.1± 5.3 mm and exceeded 10.0 mm in 12 of 13 patients, and thus tendon retraction appears to be a common clinical phenomenon. This study's objectives were to assess, using 5 longitudinal CT scans obtained over 1 year following rotator cuff repair, the variability in glenohumeral positioning because of pragmatic variations in achieving perfect arm repositioning and to estimate the associated measurement variability in bone-to-tendon marker length measurements. Methods: Forty-eight patients underwent rotator cuff repair with intraoperative placement of radiopaque tendon markers at the repair site. All patients had a CT scan with their arms at the side on the day of surgery and at 3, 12, 26, and 52 weeks postoperatively. Glenohumeral position (defined by the orientation and distance of the humerus with respect to the scapula) and bone-to-tendon marker lengths were measured from each scan. Within-patient variation in glenohumeral position measurements was described by their pooled within-patient standard deviations (SDs), and variation in bone-to-tendon marker lengths by their standard errors of measurement (SEMs) and 95% confidence level minimally detectable distances (MDD95) and changes (MDC95). Results: The mean glenohumeral orientation from the 5 longitudinal CT scans averaged across the 48 patients was 12.6° abduction, 0.4° flexion, and –0.1° internal rotation. Within-patient SDs (95% confidence intervals) of glenohumeral orientation were 3.0° (2.7°-3.4°) in extension/flexion, 5.2° (4.6°-5.8°) in abduction/adduction, and 8.2° (7.3°-9.2°) in internal/external rotation. The SDs of glenohumeral distances were less than 1 mm in any direction. The estimated SEMs of bone-to-tendon lengths were consistent with a common value of 2.4 mm for any of the tendon markers placed across the repair, with MDD95 of 4.7 mm and MDC95 of 6.7 mm. Conclusion: Apparent tendon retraction of 5 mm or more, when measured as the distance from a tendon marker's day of surgery location to its new location on a volumetrically registered longitudinal CT scan, may be considered above the usual range of measurement variation. Tendon retraction measured using implanted radiopaque tendon markers offers an objective and sufficiently reliable means for quantifying the commonly expected changes in structural healing following rotator cuff repair.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine whether virtual monochromatic dual-energy CT imaging improves the evaluation of suspected non-union of the appendicular skeleton treated with titanium or stainless steel intramedullary nails and plates. Method: Forty-one patients with a clinical suspected non-union with hardware in place were included and scanned on a dual-source CT-scanner using 100/Sn150kVp. Images including titanium hardware were extracted at 130 keV. Images including stainless steel hardware were extracted at 150 keV. Monochromatic 70 keV images served as reference. Non-union confirmed during revision surgery was used as gold standard. A musculoskeletal radiologist and orthopedic trauma surgeon evaluated images on image quality, degree and location of consolidation, non-union type and diagnostic confidence. Results: Likert scores with respect to image quality improved from 0.88 to 1.83 (p < 0.001) in high (130 and 150) keV images. High keV images reduced the number of false negative non-unions based on consolidation grade with 5% (p = 0.283). Agreement between observers regarding location of consolidation and non-union type did not improve in 130 and 150 keV images. Diagnostic confidence improved from 1.43 to 2.37 in high keV images compared to 70 keV images (p < 0.001). Overall diagnostic confidence was higher in intramedullary nails than plates (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Use of virtual monochromatic 130 and 150 keV dual-energy CT compared to 70 keV images improves the evaluation of suspected non-union of the appendicular skeleton treated with titanium or stainless steel intramedullary nails and plates.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the construct validity, criterion validity, and responsiveness of measurement instruments evaluating scapular function. DESIGN: Systematic review of measurement properties. LITERATURE SEARCH: The MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases were systematically searched from inception until March 2019. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies published in Dutch, English, or German were included when they evaluated at least 1 of the measurement properties of interest. No restrictions were made regarding participants' health status. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently evaluated study quality using the COSMIN checklist and extracted and analyzed data. Quality of evidence was graded by measurement property for each distinctive type of measurement. RESULTS: Thirty-one measurement instruments in 14 studies were categorized into instruments to measure scapular posture and movement, and to assess scapular dyskinesis. Quality of evidence was at most moderate for 4 instruments with respect to criterion validity. Of these, criterion validity for instruments measuring scapular protraction/retraction posture and rotation angles up to 120° of thoracohumeral elevation was sufficient. Criterion validity for instruments measuring asymmetrical scapular posture, range of motion, and the lateral scapular slide test was insufficient. Quality of evidence for measurement properties of all other instruments was graded lower. CONCLUSION: There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend any instrument for the clinical examination of scapular function. Measurement instruments to assess scapular dyskinesis are prone to misinterpretation and should therefore not be used as such.

N2  - CONTEXT: Recreational overhead athletes are exposed to high overload, which increases the risk of shoulder injuries. Reduction of the acromiohumeral distance (AHD) is often associated with rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (RCRSP) among the general population. However, the AHD of symptomatic shoulders of recreational athletes has not yet been compared with their asymptomatic shoulders. OBJECTIVE: To compare the AHD of a symptomatic to asymptomatic shoulder at rest (0°) and 60° abduction. To establish the relationship between AHD, pain, and functional limitations of recreational athletes with RCRSP. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: University laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 45 recreational overhead athletes with RCRSP were examined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The AHD was measured by ultrasonography at 0° and 60° abduction (angles). Shoulder pain was assessed using a numeric pain scale, whereas functional limitations were assessed using the The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire. Differences in the between-shoulders condition (symptomatic and asymptomatic) were determined using 2-way analysis of variance for repeated measures. A Pearson correlation established the relationship between AHD, pain, and functional limitations. RESULTS: No angles × shoulder condition interactions (P = .776) nor shoulder condition effects (P = .087) were detected, suggesting no significant differences (P > .05) between asymptomatic and symptomatic shoulders in the AHD at 0° or 60°. The AHD at 60° reduced significantly compared with 0° (3.05 [1.36] mm [2.77-3.33], angle effects: P < .001). The AHD at 0° and 60° was not correlated with pain or functional limitations (-.205 ≤ r ≤ .210, .167 ≤ P ≤ .585). CONCLUSIONS: The AHD of recreational athletes is not decreased in symptomatic shoulders compared with asymptomatic shoulders. Reduction of the AHD in symptomatic shoulders is not associated with an increase in pain or functional limitations of recreational athletes with RCRSP.

N2  - In this work, implementation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the purpose of analysis of functional upper limb movement pattern was applied. The main aim of the study was to compare motion of selected activities of daily living of participants after stroke with the healthy ones (in similar age). The optical, marker-based motion capture system was applied for the purpose of data acquisition. There were some attempts made in order to find the existing differences in the motion pattern of the upper limb. For this purpose, the motion features of dominant and non-dominant upper limb of healthy participants were compared with motion features of paresis and non-paresis upper limbs of participants after stroke. On the basis of the newly collected data set, a new CNN application was presented to the classification of motion data in two different class label configurations. Analyzing individual segments of the upper body, it turned out that the arm was the most sensitive segment for capturing changes in the trajectory of the lifting movements of objects.

N2  - Background: The literature suggests implantation of the humeral component in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) in 0°-40° of retrotorsion without further specification. We hypothesized that optimal humeral component retrotorsion to avoid notching and gain balanced rotational capacity would depend on scapular position and posture. Methods: We investigated 200 shoulders in 100 patients with available whole-body computed tomography scans and created 3-dimensional models. Implantation of a humeral component in 20° of retrotorsion was simulated, and a correction angle (CA) to yield perfect opposition to the glenosphere was calculated. Patient-specific variables such as age, sex, posture, and scapular orientation parameters were correlated with this CA. Results: Scapular orientation showed large interindividual differences. A highly significant correlation was seen between the CA and scapular internal rotation (R = 0.71, P < .001) and protraction (R = 0.39, P < .001). When the CA was adjusted for glenoid retroversion, the correlation coefficient of scapular internal rotation increased even further (R = 0.91, P < .001). Scapular internal rotation itself showed a correlation with thoracic kyphosis (R = 0.27, P < .001), protraction (R = 0.57, P < .001), tilt (R = 0.29, P < .001), and scapular translation (R = −0.23, P < .001). Conclusion: Scapular orientation and posture should be integrated into the determination process of humeral component retrotorsion in RTSA. In theory, implantation of the humeral component with increased retrotorsion leads to improved neutral opposition of the RTSA components in patients with extensive internal rotation of the scapula. On the basis of varying scapular internal rotation, we propose the distinction of 3 different posture types (A-C) for enhanced appraisal of scapulothoracic orientation.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients undergoing coracoclavicular (CC) ligament repair by two suture anchors and acromioclavicular (AC) joint (ACJ) fixation using heavy nonabsorbable sutures for the treatment of types III–V ACJ injuries with a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Methods: The clinical and radiographic outcomes of 36 consecutive patients (26 men and 10 women) who underwent anatomic reduction for acute ACJ dislocation using two suture anchors for CC ligament reconstruction and two strands of non-absorbable stitches for ACJ fixation between December 2013 and December 2018 were reviewed. Two 3.5 mm suture anchors with double-loaded sutures were separately inserted into the anterolateral and posteromedial portions of the coracoid process. The suture strands were passed through the hole created in the clavicle using 2.0 mm drill and tied over the clavicle. Additional ACJ augmentation using two strands of non-absorbable heavy sutures was performed in all patients. At 3, 6, and 12 months and last follow-up visit, the scores on the visual analog scale (VAS), the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant–Murley score, and simple shoulder test (SST) questionnaires were used to provide a final evaluation of shoulder function. Comparison between baseline and treatment results was performed. Radiographic analysis included vertical displacement and horizontal shift. Results: A total of 29 patients (20 men and nine women) were included in the study. A total of seven, six, and 16 patients had Rockwood type III, type IV, and type V ACJ dislocations, respectively. The mean patient age was 42.8 ± 13.5 years, with a mean follow-up of 28 months (range, 12–56 months). At the 12-month follow-up, the mean ASES score was 92.1 ± 3.5, with a mean pain score of 0.5 ± 0.7 on the VAS and mean Constant–Murley score of 93.0 ± 2.4. The new number of positive answers on the SST was 11.5 ± 0.6. Compared with the baseline, the clinical results improved significantly (P < 0.05). No significant difference could be found between the 6- and 12-month follow-up evaluations (P > 0.05). Radiographs showed two partial loss of reduction, whereas no horizontal displacement was found in all patients. One patient developed a superficial wound infection 3 weeks postoperation. The wound healed after routine wound care. No neurovascular complications were recorded. Conclusions: CC ligament reconstruction using two suture anchors and ACJ augmentation using two strands of non-absorbable heavy sutures on high-grade AC dislocation is a reliable technique for restoring stability to the ACJ and can obtain good to excellent clinical results.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the clinical efficacy and outcomes of the coracoid osteotomy with or without Bristow–Latarjet procedures in the treatment of chronic anterior shoulder dislocation (CASD). Methods: Between January 2013 and January 2019, 20 shoulders of 18 patients who were diagnosed with chronic anterior dislocation and underwent open reduction in our trauma center were retrospectively studied. Open coracoid osteotomy with Bristow–Latarjet procedures were performed on 16 shoulders and open coracoid osteotomy without Bristow–Latarjet procedures were performed on four shoulders. Open coracoid osteotomy with or without Bristow–Latarjet procedures were chosen on the basis of the stability of the shoulder after reduction. Outcomes were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively with the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder rating scale, and the range of motion (ROM) for shoulder activity. Results: There were three males and 15 females with an average age of 60.94 ± 2.69 years. The time between dislocation and treatment ranged from 21 to 240 days with an average of 73.3 ± 14.4 days. All patients were available for a mean follow-up of 15.2 ± 4.3 months. No procedure-related death or incision-related superficial or deep tissue infection was identified in all cases. No iatrogenic neurovascular injuries or fractures were found in this study. At the time of 12 months follow-up, the range of motion and the shoulder functional evaluation (VAS [P < 0.001], ASES [P < 0.001], and UCLA score [P < 0.001]) in patients who underwent Bristow–Latarjet procedures were significantly improved. Subluxation after surgical procedure was found and confirmed in one patient and this patient refused to undergo revision surgery. According to the Samilson and Prieto classification system, 16 shoulders were assessed as grade 0, three shoulders were grade 1, one shoulder was grade 2. Conclusions: Coracoid osteotomy with or without Bristow–Latarjet procedure yielded an acceptable clinical result in this study. This method has the advantages of enlarging the exposure of surgical field, assisting reduction of shoulder, and convenient conversion to Bristow–Latarjet procedure. It is an efficient and reliable method for treatment of chronic anterior shoulder dislocation. A 69-year-old woman diagnosed with right chronic anterior shoulder dislocation with large Hill–Sachs lesion. The latarjet procedure with remplissage technique was applied for this patient.

N2  - Objective: The primary aim was to investigate the effect of inferior shoulder mobilization on scapular and shoulder muscle activity during resisted shoulder abduction in asymptomatic individuals. Methods: This was a lab-based, repeated-measures, crossover, randomized controlled study. Twenty-two participants were recruited. The order of experimental conditions was randomized. Each participant performed 5 repetitions of resisted shoulder abduction before and after the control and mobilization (grade +IV inferior shoulder mobilization, 3 sets, 60 seconds) conditions. Surface electromyography recorded the muscle activity of anterior, middle, and posterior deltoid; supraspinatus; infraspinatus; upper and lower trapezius; serratus anterior; and latissimus dorsi muscles. Results: Muscle activity levels reduced for infraspinatus (11.3% MVIC, 95% CI: 1.7-20.8), middle (22.4% MVIC, 95% CI: 15.9-28.8) and posterior deltoid (8.7 % MVIC, 95% CI: 4.6-12.9), and serratus anterior (-28.1% MVIC, 95% CI: 15.6-40.8) muscles after the mobilization condition during the eccentric phase of shoulder abduction. No carryover effects were observed, and within-session reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient scores ranging from 0.94 to 0.99). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that inferior glenohumeral mobilization reduces activity levels of some scapular and shoulder muscles. Given the exploratory nature of our study, changes in muscle activity levels may have been found by chance. Confirmatory studies are required.

N2  - Although three-dimensional electromagnetic systems are widely used to evaluate the 3-dimensional scapular kinematics their reliability when testing bilateral upper extremity tasks is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the repeatability of the scapular kinematic analyses using the Flock of Birds (FOB) system during bilateral upper extremity movements. Twenty-one volunteers without shoulder problems were included (aged 24.8 years; body mass index averaged 21.2 kg/m2) to the study. Scapular internal-external rotation, upward-downward rotation, and anterior-posterior tilt was recorded during bilateral arm elevation on sagittal, scapular and frontal planes. Measurements were repeated at 5–7 days intervals. Intra-session and inter-session repeatability were determined using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) scores and standard errors of measurements (SEM). The ICC scores were found to be 0.81 to 0.99 for intra-session measurements and 0.60 to 0.83 for inter-session measurements. The SEM scores were 0.8°–3.4° and 2°–7.2° for the intra and inter-session measurements respectively. The repeatability of the FOB system was excellent for the intra-session measurements, but it was weaker for the inter-session measurements. These results support the use of the FOB system for assessing scapular orientation but the analyses should be conducted more carefully when it is applied to the longitudinal measurements.

N2  - Background: Structural bone graft for reconstruction of glenoid bone stock is often necessary in the setting of revision shoulder arthroplasty. This study introduces a new structural autograft technique using the distal clavicle for treatment of glenoid bone loss in the setting of revision shoulder arthroplasty. Methods: This is a retrospective, single-surgeon study of patients with significant glenoid bone loss requiring revision shoulder arthroplasty with autologous distal clavicle bone grafting to the glenoid. Twenty patients with failed shoulder arthroplasty who underwent revisions of their glenoid components between 2015 and 2019 were retrospectively identified. Sixteen patients were available with follow-up of greater than 1 year. Patient records and radiographs were reviewed for intraoperative and postoperative complications. Preoperative and postoperative function were evaluated by physical examination and patient-reported outcome surveys. Results: There were no observed intraoperative complications relating to the distal clavicle autograft harvest or placement. There were no iatrogenic nerve injuries or intraoperative instability. One of the 16 patients developed postoperative loosening and subsequent failure of the glenoid baseplate, requiring revision. One additional patient demonstrated increased elevation of the coracoclavicular interval postoperatively, likely related to the distal clavicle autograft harvest. At a mean follow-up of 25 months, 15 of 16 glenoid implants remained well fixed (93.4%), with no evidence of infection, or impingement demonstrated radiographically or clinically. Average patient age was 69 years at the time of surgery. Forward elevation improved from 76° to 123° at final follow-up (P =.0002). The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form score improved from an average of 35.8 to 67.8 at mean follow-up (P =.001). The visual analog scale score improved from an average of 5.9 to 2 at mean follow-up, though not statistically significant (P =.068). There was no significant change in external rotation following surgery (P =.319). Conclusion: Osteolysis and bone loss of the glenoid poses a challenging problem in revision shoulder arthroplasty. Distal clavicle autograft augmentation is a viable and reproducible technique to manage structural glenoid defects.

N2  - Background: Many imaging technologies used to diagnose TMJ pathologies. MRI, corrected TM tomography, transcranial radiograph, OPG, and Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) are used to view TMJ. For many years CT scans had an good impact on TMJ imaging but high radiation dose, equipment size and cost had limited the use of CT scan. Low cost and variable dose of radiation and three dimensional scan favor the use of CBCT for TMJ imaging. Aim: To derive data which might provide a baseline regarding optimum joint space as a diagnostic tool for early detection of TMD's involving loss of joint space or leading to asymmetrical joint space. Methods: The study included 62 patients (41 were males and 21 were females, having age of 30-60 years) having no temporomandibular joint symptoms clinically..Their temporomandibular joints had optimum functioning with the all functional jaw movements coincident with maximum intercuspation. Temporomandibular joint space distances between the condyle and glenoid fossae were measured at the medial, central and lateral positions in coronal plane. Results: Analysis showed the measurement of coronal medial surface (CMS), coronal central surface(CCS), coronal lateral surface (CLS) in males are 1.7mm, 2.5mm and 1.8mm. Conclusions: CBCT is a reliable tool for assessment of Temporomandibular anatomy and space. Study of normal anatomy will help in diagnosis of temporomandibular joint disorders.

N2  - Background: Temporary occlusal changes and their influence on the upper body statics are still controversially discussed. Furthermore, concrete statements on whether age-or gender-specific differences in neurophysiological reactions exist are missing. Therefore, it is the aim of this study to evaluate the immediate effects of a symmetrical occlusion blocking on the upper body posture. These effects shall be investigated for both genders and for a larger age range. Methods: In this study, 800 (407f/393 m) subjects volunteered aged from 21 to 60 years. Both genders were divided into four age groups according to decades. The three-dimensional upper body posture was measured by using the rasterstereography (ABW-Bodymapper). The habitual static posture was measured in two dental occlusion conditions (a) in rest position and (b) symmetrical blocking in the bicuspid region by cotton rolls. Results: A significant reduction of the trunk length (0.72 mm; p < 0.001), an increase of the lumbar (0.30°; p < 0.001) and the thoracic bending angle (0.14°; p = 0.001), a reduction of the spinal forward decline (0.16°; p < 0.001) and a reduction of the scapular distance (0.36 mm; p = 0.001) was found. Gender-specific reactions can only be recorded in scapular distance, in that regard men reduce this distance while over all age groups women did not show a significant change. Discussion: Slight gender- A nd age-independent reactions due to a symmetric occlusion blockade are shown: A gender independent reaction of the spinal related variables in the sagittal plane (thoracic and lumbar flexion angle, trunk length, spinal forward decline). In addition, a gender specific change of the shoulder blade distance could be observed, where men reduced the distance while female did not show a change. However, since these reactions are of a minimum amount, it can be concluded that neurophysiological compensation mechanisms work equally well regardless of age and sex, and the upper body posture of healthy people changes only very slightly due to a temporarily symmetrical altered bite position.

N2  - Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the intra-and inter-rater reliability coefficients of the supraspinatus tendon thickness, acromiohumeral distance, and occupation ratio in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome. Patients and methods: The study included 83 patients (21 males, 62 females; mean age 51.6±11.0 years; range, 26 to 70 years) with shoulder impingement syndrome. The supraspinatus tendon thickness, acromiohumeral distance, and occupation ratio values were obtained one week apart by two observers. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), minimum detectable change, and standard error of measurement were calculated. Results: The first observer had excellent intra-rater reliability in all measurements (ICC >0.90) with minimum detectable change of 0.740-0.047 mm and standard error of measurement of 0.017-0.26 mm. The second observer had excellent intra-rater reliability in supraspinatus tendon thickness and acromiohumeral distance measurements (ICC >0.90) with minimum detectable change of 0.498-0.770 mm and standard error of measurement of 0.18-0.28 mm and good intra-rater reliability in the occupation ratio measurement (ICC; 0.75-0.90) with minimum detectable change of 0.060 mm and standard error of measurement of 0.022 mm. Inter-rater reliability coefficients were 0.916 (95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.873-0.945) for supraspinatus tendon thickness, 0.943 (95% CI; 0.914-0.963) for acromiohumeral distance with minimum detectable change of 0.673 mm and standard error of measurement of 0.243 mm and 0.790 (%95 CI; 0.693-0.853) for occupation ratio with minimum detectable change of 0.077 mm and standard error of measurement of 0.028 mm. Conclusion: These findings suggest that ultrasonographic measurements of the supraspinatus tendon thickness, acromiohumeral distance and occupation ratio can be reliable and consistent for clinical evaluation of patients with shoulder impingement syndrome in terms of supporting diagnosis and monitoring the treatment effect.

N2  - Background: No previous studies have investigated whether the extent of scapular dyskinesis is associated with shoulder dysfunction. This study aimed (1) to establish the reliability of a scapulometer in patients with shoulder pain and (2) to investigate the related factors associated with shoulder dysfunction. Methods: One hundred participants with symptomatic scapular dyskinesis were recruited. Twenty-one participants were involved in the reliability study to test the intrarater and inter-rater reliabilities of the scapulometer in patients with shoulder pain. After demographic data and self-reported Flexilevel Scale of Shoulder Function (FLEX-SF) scores were recorded, all participants were measured with a scapulometer to determine the posterior displacement of the root of the spine (ROS) and the inferior angle (IFA) of the scapula from the thorax. Next, the participants performed 5 trials of bilateral scapular plane elevation for scapular kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) data collection. Stepwise multiple linear regressions were used to determine the relationships between self-reported FLEX-SF scores and potential factors. In addition to scapular displacement, pain level, scapular kinematics, and EMG data were included as independent variables. Results: The intrarater and inter-rater reliabilities of the scapulometer were excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.93-0.97) and moderate to good (ICC = 0.74-0.81), respectively. The Bland-Altman plots showed no systematic bias between raters in the ROS and IFA measurements. Final stepwise multiple regression models showed that more ROS distance, higher serratus anterior activity, and lower pain level during arm elevation were associated with higher shoulder function (total R2 = 0.253). Conclusion: The reliability of the scapulometer in patients with shoulder pain is moderate to excellent. Scapular dyskinesis may be a compensatory strategy to avoid shoulder pain and improve shoulder function.

N2  - Background: Revision reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) reliably improves shoulder pain and function in patients with failed shoulder arthroplasty, although it can lead to significant postoperative complications. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of postoperative complications on shoulder pain and function after revision RTSA. Methods: We evaluated 36 patients at an average of 4.3 years (range, 2-8.6 years) after revision of a shoulder arthroplasty to RTSA. Of these patients, 9 had a failed anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty, 23 had a failed hemiarthroplasty, and 4 had a failed RTSA. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score and visual analog scale (VAS) pain score were evaluated postoperatively, and patients with and without postoperative complications were compared. Results: The final ASES score and VAS pain score were 61 ± 23 and 2.4 ± 2.3, respectively. A major postoperative complication occurred in 7 patients (19%) (infection in 3, hematoma in 1, instability in 1, and acromial and/or scapular spine fracture in 2). Further surgical treatment was required in 5 patients (14%) (irrigation and débridement and component exchange for infection in 3, irrigation and débridement for hematoma in 1, and open reduction–internal fixation of scapular spine fracture in 1). On comparison of clinical outcomes between patients with and patients without complications, the ASES score and VAS pain score were significantly worse in patients with complications vs. those without them (ASES score, 43 ± 24 vs. 66 ± 21 [P =.04]; VAS pain score, 4.3 ± 2 vs. 2 ± 2.2 [P =.03]). Conclusion: Revision RTSA resulted in postoperative pain and shoulder function comparable to primary RTSA reported in the literature, although postoperative complications led to clinically significant declines in function and increases in pain.

N2  - Background: Revision surgery in cases of previously failed primary acromioclavicular (AC) joint stabilization remains challenging mainly because of anatomic alterations or technical difficulties. However, anatomic coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction (ACCR) has been shown to achieve encouraging biomechanical, clinical, and radiographic short-term to midterm results. Purpose: To evaluate the clinical and radiographic long-term outcomes of patients undergoing revision ACCR after failed operative treatment for type III through V AC joint injuries with a minimum 10-year follow-up. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on prospectively collected data within an institutional shoulder registry. Patients who underwent revision ACCR for type III through V AC joint injuries between January 2003 and December 2009 were analyzed. Clinical outcome measures included the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE). The coracoclavicular distance (CCD) was measured for radiographic analysis immediately postoperatively and at last postoperative follow-up. Results: A total of 8 patients with a mean age at the time of surgery of 44.6 ± 10.6 years and a mean follow-up of 135.0 ± 17.4 months (range, 120-167 months) were eligible for inclusion in the study. The time from initial AC joint stabilization until revision surgery was 10.2 ± 12.4 months (range, 0.5-36 months); 62.5% of the patients had undergone more than 2 previous AC joint surgical procedures. The ASES score improved from 43.9 ± 22.4 preoperatively to 80.6 ± 28.8 postoperatively (P =.012), the SST score improved from 4.4 ± 3.6 preoperatively to 11.0 ± 2.2 postoperatively (P =.017), and the SANE score improved from 31.4 ± 27.3 preoperatively to 86.9 ± 24.1 postoperatively (P =.018) at final follow-up. There was no significant difference in the CCD (P =.08) between the first (7.6 ± 3.0 mm) and final (10.6 ± 2.8 mm) radiographic follow-up (mean, 50.5 ± 32.7 months [range, 18-98 months]). Conclusion: Patients undergoing revision ACCR after failed operative treatment for type III through V AC joint injuries maintained significant improvement in clinical outcomes at a minimum 10-year follow-up.

N2  - Background: Interpretation of shoulder motion across studies has been complicated due to the use of numerous scapular coordinate systems in the literature. Currently, there are no simple means by which to compare scapular kinematics between coordinate system definitions when data from only one coordinate system is known. Research question: How do scapular kinematics vary based on the choice of coordinate system and can average rotation matrices be used to accurately convert kinematics between scapular local coordinate systems? Methods: Average rotation matrices derived from anatomic landmarks of 51 cadaver scapulae (29 M/22 F; 59 ± 13 yrs; 26R/25 L; 171 ± 11 cm; 70 ± 19 kg; 23.7 ± 5.5 kg/m2) were generated between three common scapular coordinate systems. Absolute angle of rotation was used to determine if anatomical variability within the cadaver population influenced the matrices. To quantify the predictive capability to convert kinematics between the three coordinate systems, the average rotation matrices were applied to scapulothoracic motion data collected from 19 human subjects (10 M/9 F; 43 ± 17 yrs; 19R; 173 ± 9 cm; 71 ± 16 kg; 23.6 ± 4.5 kg/m2) using biplane fluoroscopy. Root mean squared error (RMSE) was used to compare kinematics from an original coordinate system to the kinematics expressed in each alternative coordinate system. Results: The choice of scapular coordinate system resulted in mean differences in scapulothoracic rotation of up to 23°, with overall different shapes and/or magnitudes of the curves. A single average rotation matrix between any two coordinate systems achieved accurate conversion of scapulothoracic kinematics to within 4° of RMSE of the known solution. The average rotation matrices were independent of sex, side, decomposition sequence, and motion. Significance: Scapulothoracic kinematic representations vary in shape and magnitude based solely on the choice of local coordinate system. The results of this study enhance interpretability and reproducibility in expressing scapulothoracic motion data between laboratories by providing a simple means to convert data between common coordinate systems. This is necessitated by the variety of available motion analysis techniques and their respective scapular landmark definitions.

N2  - Objective: Scapular notching is a unique radiographic sequela of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) with unclear long-term clinical consequences. Methods: Our retrospective review of a single surgeon, single implant, primary rTSA database investigates the incidence of scapular notching at 2 and 5-year follow-up. Various patient outcome scores were also obtained. Results: Of 158 primary rTSAs performed, 82 (52%) patients completed 2-year and subsequent 5-year follow-up. The incidence of scapular notching at 2 and 5-years was 11.9% and 19.5%, respectively. Conclusion: Scapular notching negatively affects validated post-operative outcome scores, active range of motion and total complications, and furthermore increases with time.

N2  - Objectives: Compensations are commonly employed by patients with stroke during rehabilitation without therapist supervision, leading to suboptimal recovery outcomes. This study investigated the feasibility of the real-time monitoring of compensation in patients with stroke by using pressure distribution data and machine learning algorithms. Whether trunk compensation can be reduced by combining the online detection of compensation and haptic feedback of a rehabilitation robot was also investigated. Methods: Six patients with stroke did three forms of reaching movements while pressure distribution data were recorded as Dataset1. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained with features extracted from Dataset1. Then, two other patients with stroke performed reaching tasks, and the SVM classifier trained by Dataset1 was employed to classify the compensatory patterns online. Based on the real-time monitoring of compensation, a rehabilitation robot provided an assistive force to patients with stroke to reduce compensations. Results: Good classification performance (F1 score > 0.95) was obtained in both offline and online compensation analysis using the SVM classifier and pressure distribution data of patients with stroke. Based on the real-time detection of compensatory patterns, the angles of trunk rotation, trunk lean-forward and trunk-scapula elevation decreased by 46.95%, 32.35% and 23.75%, respectively. Conclusion: High classification accuracies verified the feasibility of detecting compensation in patients with stroke based on pressure distribution data. Since the validity and reliability of the online detection of compensation has been verified, this classifier can be incorporated into a rehabilitation robot to reduce trunk compensations in patients with stroke.

N2  - The neural surgical options for reconstruction of elbow flexion in brachial plexus injuries depend on the availability of nerve donors. In upper-type avulsion injuries, the ulnar or median nerves, when intact, are reliable intra-plexal donor nerves for transfers to the biceps muscle. In complete avulsion injuries, donors are limited to extra-plexal sources, such as intercostal nerves (ICNs). Methods: We reviewed our results of ICN and partial distal nerve (ulnar or median) transfers for elbow flexion reconstruction in patients with brachial plexus avulsion injuries. The time taken for recovery of elbow flexion strength to M3 and the final motor outcome at 2 years were compared between both groups. Results: 38 patients were included in this study. 27 had ICN transfers to the musculocutaneous nerve (MCN), 8 had partial ulnar nerve transfers and 3 had partial median nerve transfers to the MCN's biceps motor branch. The mean time interval from injury to surgery was 3.6 months. Recovery of elbow flexion was observed earlier in the distal nerve transfer group (p < 0.05). Overall, success rates were higher in patients with distal nerve transfers (100%), compared to ICN transfers (63%) at 2 years (p = 0.018). Patients with distal nerve transfers achieved a higher final median strength of M4.0 [Interquartile range (IQR) 3.5-4.5], compared to M3.5 (IQR 2.0-4.0) in the ICN group (p = 0.031). In the subgroup of patients with upper-type brachial plexus injuries, there were no significant differences in motor outcomes between the ICN versus distal nerve transfers group. Conclusions: In our entire cohort, patients with distal nerve transfers had faster motor recovery and better elbow flexion power than patients with ICN transfers. In patients with partial brachial plexus injuries, outcomes of ICN transfers were not inferior to distal nerve transfers.

N2  - In this work, we extend the modeling techniques of human shoulder-arm musculoskeletal dynamics by 1) proposing an extended model with 12 joint degrees of freedom and 27 muscles (modeled as 42 musculotendinous actuators) that is capable of most physiologically and anatomically possible movements, 2) proposing a forward dynamics model driven by muscle activation, where the scapulothoracic constraint is formulated as an anatomically consistent force field, and 3) applying the state-of-the-art inverse dynamics solution on this model. We experimentally validate it against electromyograms for 10 activities of daily living. This validated shoulder-arm musculoskeletal model may e.g., serve as a reference plant model in studying human motor control or as part of a human simulator in the future.

N2  - Background: It is difficult to predict the arthroscopic reparability of rotator cuff tears preoperatively when the repair is challenging. This can result in unsatisfactory outcomes and a high retear rate. Purpose: To develop an assessment score reflecting factors in rotator cuff tears that can predict reparability before surgery. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 170 patients with rotator cuff tears larger than 2 cm who underwent arthroscopic repair. Patients were categorized into “complete repair” and “partial repair” groups based on the area of the exposed footprint after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. In each group, preoperative magnetic resonance imaging factors (tear size, fatty infiltration, remnant tendon length, atrophy), clinical factors (range of motion, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Constant score), and patient demographics were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to choose the optimal cutoff value. A reparability assessment score was formulated through stepwise selection using variables that showed significant between-group differences on univariate analysis. We selected 4 variables and assigned a relative score for each variable based on estimated coefficient values. The sum of the scores for each factor ranged from 0 to 5. Results: The average rotator cuff tear size was 28 × 26 mm. The torn rotator cuff was repaired completely in 74 patients (43.5%) and partially in 96 patients (56.5%). The following factors were chosen for the reparability assessment score: positive tangent sign (odds ratio [OR], 5.969; P =.001), fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus of grade ≤2 (OR, 3.537; P =.001), coronal tear size ≥26 mm (OR, 3.315; P =.002), and remnant tendon length <15 mm (OR, 2.584; P =.017). Complete repair was possible if the sum of the scores was <3 (area under curve, 0.803; 95% CI, 0.739-0.867; sensitivity, 51.0%; specificity, 95.9%). Conclusion: In patients with a score of <3 on the novel reparability assessment score, complete repair was obtainable, whereas in patients with a score of ≥3, complete repair was difficult and other methods such as biologic grafts or arthroplasty had to be considered for a favorable prognosis.

N2  - Purpose: To determine the accuracy of glenoid bone loss–measuring methods and assess the influence of the imaging modality on the accuracy of the measurement methods. Methods: A literature search was performed in the PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, and Cochrane databases from 1994 to June 11, 2019. The guidelines and algorithm of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) were used. Included for analysis were articles reporting the accuracy of glenoid bone loss–measuring methods in patients with anterior shoulder instability by comparing an index test and a reference test. Furthermore, articles were included if anterior glenoid bone loss was quantified using a ruler during arthroscopy or by measurements on plain radiograph(s), computed tomography (CT) images, or magnetic resonance images in living humans. The risk of bias was determined using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Results: Twenty-one studies were included, showing 17 different methods. Three studies reported on the accuracy of methods performed on 3-dimensional CT. Two studies determined the accuracy of glenoid bone loss–measuring methods performed on radiography by comparing them with methods performed on 3-dimensional CT. Six studies determined the accuracy of methods performed using imaging modalities with an arthroscopic method as the reference. Eight studies reported on the influence of the imaging modality on the accuracy of the methods. There was no consensus regarding the gold standard. Because of the heterogeneity of the data, a quantitative analysis was not feasible. Conclusions: Consensus regarding the gold standard in measuring glenoid bone loss is lacking. The use of heterogeneous data and varying methods contributes to differences in the gold standard, and accuracy therefore cannot be determined. Level of Evidence: Level IV, systematic review of Level II, III, and IV studies.

N2  - Accelerometry is a recent method used to quantify workload in team sports. A rapidly increasing number of studies supports the practical implementation of accelerometry monitoring to regulate and optimize training schemes. Therefore, the purposes of this study were: (1) to reflect the current state of knowledge about accelerometry as a method of workload monitoring in invasion team sports according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and (2) to conclude recommendations for application and scientific investigations. The Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for relevant published studies according to the following keywords: “accelerometry” or “accelerometer” or “microtechnology” or “inertial devices”, and “load” or “workload”, and “sport”. Of the 1383 studies initially identified, 118 were selected for a full review. The main results indicate that the most frequent findings were (i) devices’ body location: scapulae; (b) devices brand: Catapult Sports; (iii) variables: PlayerLoadTM and its variations; (iv) sports: rugby, Australian football, soccer and basketball; (v) sex: male; (vi) competition level: professional and elite; and (vii) context: separate training or competition. A great number of variables and devices from various companies make the comparability between findings difficult; unification is required. Although the most common location is at scapulae because of its optimal signal reception for time-motion analysis, new methods for multi-location skills and locomotion assessment without losing tracking accuracy should be developed.

N2  - Objective: To examine the short-term outcomes of modified load-sharing rip-stop repair (mLSRS) and suture-bridge repair (SB) for large rotator cuff tear. Methods: The clinical data of patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy for large rotator cuff repair at Department of Orthopedic, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Wang Jing Hospital from January 2017 to December 2018 were collected. Totally 111 patients (39 in mLSRS group and 72 in SB group) were included in the study. There were 45 males and 66 females, aged (58.0±6.9)years (range: 40 to 72 years).A total of 39 pairs of patients were successfully matched by propensity score matching. The pain of shoulder joint was assessed by visual analogy score (VAS) , the shoulder function was assessed by Constant-Murley score, the abduction strength of bilateral shoulder joint was assessed by 90˚ force assessment method of upper limb on the plane of scapula, and the healing of rotator cuff on the operative side was assessed by sugaya ultrasonic classification standard. The difference of short-term outcome between the two groups were compared using t test, χ(2) test, Mann-Whitney U test, repeated measures design anova and multivariate analysis of variance. Results: At the 4th week after surgery, the VAS of mLSRS group was significantly lower than SB group(1 (2) vs. 2 (2) , F=5.32, P=0.02). One year after surgery, Constant-Murley score of two groups were significantly higher than those before surgery, but there was no significant difference between two groups(89.1±5.7 vs. 87.6±7.3, t=1.00, P=0.32). Abductor strength of affected limbs were lower than that of the opposite side, but there were no statistically significant differences between two groups(4.28±1.61 vs. 4.54±1.64, t=-0.70, P=0.49). According to the Sugaya classification, 32 cases in mLSRS group were healed while 7 cases were not healed,30 cases in SB group were healed while 9 cases were not healed(χ(2)=0.32, P=0.58). Conclusion: The use of mLSRS fixation construct on large rotator cuff tear can reduce pain and the short-term outcome is reliable.

N2  - Objectives: The literature indicates that reduced acromiohumeral distance (AHD) and increased critical shoulder angle (CSA) are associated with large and massive rotator cuff (RC) tears which may not be amenable to a successful repair. The purpose of this study was to examine the overall accuracy of these two radiographic features in diagnosing significant RC pathology. Methods: This was a diagnostic study of patients with shoulder pain. To examine the overall accuracy of the measurements, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated. The validity indices (sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios) examined the predictive value of specific cutoff categories of AHD<6 mm and the CSA >35°. Results: Data of 200 consecutive patients; mean age: 59(11), 117 males were used for analysis. There was a weak inverse correlation (r = 0.46) between the AHD and CSA. The AUCs for presence and size of RC tear and different stages of fatty infiltration of supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles varied from fair to excellent for AHD and poor to good for CSA. Specificity was high for the cutoff categories of both AHD and CSA (>90%). The positive LRs were large for AHD and small to moderate for CSA. Conclusion: The AHD and CSA were reliably measured in the true AP radiographic view. Both radiographic features (AHD<6mm and CSA>35°) were able to confirm the presence of a major RC pathology. However, the AHD<6 mm, an acquired radiologic abnormality secondary to failure of the RC muscles/tendons had better measurement properties. This information is of value to primary care physicians, sports medicine specialists and advanced practice physiotherapists in their clinical decision making.

N2  - Background: The role of altered joint mechanics on cartilage degeneration in in vivo models has not been studied successfully due to a lack of pre-injury information. We aimed 1) to develop an accurate in vivo canine model to measure the changes in joint loading and T2 star (T2*) relaxation time before and after unilateral supraspinatus tendon resections, and 2) to find the relationship between regional variations in articular cartilage loading patterns and T2*relaxation time distributions. Methods: Rigid markers were implanted in the scapula and humerus of tested dogs. The movement of the shoulder bones were measured by a motion tracking system during normal gaits. In vivo cartilage contact strain was measured by aligning 3D shoulder models with the motion tracking data. Articular cartilage T2*relaxation times were measured by quantitative MRI scans. Articular cartilage contact strain and T2*relaxation time were compared in the shoulders before and 3 months after the supraspinatus tendon resections. Results: Excellent accuracy and reproducibility were found in our in vivo contact strain measurements with less than 1% errors. Changes in articular cartilage contact strain exhibited similar patterns with the changes in the T2*relaxation time after resection surgeries. Regional changes in the articular cartilage T2*relaxation time exhibited positive correlations with regional contact strain variations 3 months after the supraspinatus resection surgeries. Conclusion: This is the first study to measure in vivo articular cartilage contact strains with high accuracy and reproducibility. Positive correlations between contact strain and T2*relaxation time suggest that the articular cartilage extracellular matrix may responds to mechanical changes in local areas.

N2  - Due to the complex coupling motion of shoulder mechanism, only a small amount of quantitative information is available in the existing literature, although various kinematic models of the shoulder complex have been proposed. This study focused on the specific motion coupling relationship between glenohumeral (GH) joint center displacement variable quantity relative to the thorax coordinate system and humeral elevation angle to describe the shoulder complex. The mechanism model of shoulder complex was proposed with an algorithm designed. Subsequently, twelve healthy subjects performed right arm raising, lowering, as well as raising and lowering (RAL) movements in sixteen elevation planes, and the motion information of the markers attached to the thorax, scapula, and humerus was captured by using Vicon motion capturing system. Then, experimental data was processed and the generalized GH joint with floating center was quantized. Simultaneously, different coupling characteristics were detected during humerus raising as well as lowering movements. The motion coupling relationships in different phases were acquired, and a modified kinematic model was established, with the description of overall motion characteristics of shoulder complex validated by comparing the results with a prior kinematic model from literature, showing enough accuracy for the design of upper limb rehabilitation robots.

N2  - Study Design: This is a systematic review. Introduction: Scapular taping is widely used in the management of scapular dysfunction. However, its effects on the scapular kinematics and the electromyography (EMG) activity of the periscapular muscles are not clear. Purpose of the Study: The purpose of the study was to systematically review the current literature to examine whether scapular corrective taping alters the EMG activity of the periscapular muscles and the 3-dimensional scapular kinematics. Method: MEDLINE and Web of Science databases were searched using specific mesh terms up to April 2018. A hand search was also conducted on the reference list of the included articles. A total of 157 studies were identified, and they were further analyzed for the eligibility to the systematic review. Studies that investigated the effects of scapular corrective taping on the EMG activity of the periscapular muscles and on the 3-dimensional scapular kinematics on patients with shoulder problems or asymptomatic subjects were eligible for the systematic review. The Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care criteria were modified and used for the risk-of-bias assessment. Results: Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. Five studies investigated the effects of corrective taping on the scapular kinematics and 8 studies reported the effects of corrective taping on the EMG activity of the periscapular muscles. There was an agreement among the studies that scapular upward rotation is increased with the corrective taping, while there are inconsistent results concerning the scapular external rotation and posterior tilt. In addition, studies mostly reported that corrective taping decreases the activity of the upper trapezius, while it has conflicting effects on the activity patterns of other periscapular muscles. Discussion: Scapular corrective taping was found to increase the scapular upward rotation; however, its effects on scapular external rotation and posterior tilt are controversial. It was also found that corrective taping might decrease the EMG activity of the upper trapezius, while it had no effects on the activity of lower trapezius, and its effects on other periscapular muscles were controversial. Conclusion: The results of the studies indicated that scapular corrective taping might alter the 3-dimensional scapular kinematics, while there are controversies about the effects of corrective taping on the EMG activity of the periscapular muscles. Further studies are needed to clarify the conflicts.

N2  - Gait and posture parameters of ten advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients were assessed before and after starting levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) treatment by means of both objective video analysis and clinical assessment. After 3 years of treatment, gait and posture remained stable. A slower gait velocity at baseline significantly correlates with a higher axial and motor severity at follow-up. This pilot study suggests that validated video analysis software may support the clinical assessment of axial signs in PD patients who are candidates for device-aided therapies.

N2  - Prevalence of scapular dyskinesis varies across records, with overhead athletes being more frequently affected than non-overhead athletes A number of methods have been described to evaluate scapular kinematics and scapular dyskinesis. The “yes/no” and the “4-type” classification systems are widely accepted and diffusely used among orthopaedics and physical therapists. The inter-rater reliability for both the “yes/no” and the “4-type” classification systems may be different. Moreover, differences between physical therapists and orthopaedic surgeons may exist. Seven examiners (2 orthopaedic surgeons and 5 physical therapists) were asked to evaluate a mixed sequence of video recordings of healthy subjects and patients affected by shoulder, scapular or clavicular disorders and to assess scapular dyskinesis using the “yes/no” and the “4-type” classification systems. Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ) and weighted kappa were used to measure inter-rater reliability. Twenty-four subjects were enrolled. In general, the “4-type” system has higher κ values than ‘‘yes/no’’ classification system and orthopaedic surgeons achieve higher reliability than physical therapists for both systems. The clinical evaluation of active shoulder movements permits reproducible assessment and classification of scapular dyskinesis, in particular for the “4-type” classification system. The “4-type” classification system can be used to assess and classify scapular dyskinesis, especially among orthopaedic surgeons.

N2  - Aesthetic impairment is a crucial issue in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS), but to date no objective measurements are available. The aim of the study is to evaluate the repeatability of 17 parameters measured by surface topography in a group of AIS subjects and verify their diagnostic validity. The paper is divided into three cross-sectional observational studies. We evaluated 17 selected surface topography parameters that could be good predictors of scoliosis’ impact on the patients’ trunk. We analysed short-term (30 seconds, 38 subjects) and medium-term (90 minutes, 14 subjects) repeatability of surface topography measures and their diagnostic validity in AIS (74 subjects, 33 AIS patients and 41 healthy subjects). All examined parameters were highly correlated as far as short and medium-term repeatability is concerned. We found a statistically significant difference between the scoliosis group and the control group in 3 surface rotation parameters, 1 shoulder parameter and 3 waist parameters. In conclusion, surface topography showed a good repeatability. Moreover, some of its parameters are correlated with AIS, enabling us to find differences between pathological and healthy subjects. Thanks to these findings, it will be possible to develop a tool that can objectively evaluate aesthetics is AIS patients.

N2  - Introduction: Shoulder complaints have high re-occurrence rates and scapular control seems to be a major influencing factor in sub-acromial impingement syndromes (SIS). Scapular dyskinesia disrupts the scapulohumeral rhythm, altering biomechanical loads on the rotator cuff in shoulder movements. As a result, this disturbs the natural healing process. Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) seems to be a promising treatment approach because it has a focus on motor learning. This case report seeks to illustrate the clinical reasoning and feasibility of applying the comprehensive nature of PNF in a patient who was not responsive to standard physiotherapy. Case description: A 47-year-old male, a former professional handball player, was diagnosed with a SIS based upon a rotator-cuff tendinopathy, scapular dyskinesia and degeneration of supraspinatus tendon. The patient presented complaints of right sided shoulder pain in overhead activities and in reaching behind the back. Patient management: PNF-based motor-control training was provided over a period of five weeks. This approach included specified PNF-pattern exercises with specific PNF-facilitation principles and techniques. The results were improvements beyond the minimal clinical important difference and/or minimal detectable change for physical functioning, pain, range of motion, and functional disability of the shoulder. Discussion and conclusion: PNF provided an opportunity for motor control training, restored altered movement patterns in the patient's daily life activities. The approach addressed motor learning effects and structural impairments. PNF-patterns have been described as: “mimicking functional activities” from daily life and from sports. In cases where standard strengthening and mobilization exercises are not effective, a specified PNF-based therapy has shown to be a feasible alternative.

N2  - Introduction: In the follow-up of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, the physical examination of the joints in order to determine the number of painful and swollen joints is the cornerstone for determining activity. The objective of this study was to find out the opinion of a group of rheumatologists as regards the examination of joints of patients with RA to define the swollen or painful joint. At the same time an evaluation was made on the variation in the joints examination between the participants. Methods: A questionnaire was administered to a group of rheumatologists in order to determine general issues and examining each of the joints, as well as concepts of definitions of pain and inflammation in the joints. Results: The majority of the participants (78%) stated that all aspects were important, such as evaluating passive joint mobilisation, pain to palpation, and spontaneous pain. Passive mobility without having pain or swollen joint tenderness was said to be important by 53.8% of the participants, and 62.6% agreed with observing the pressure exerted by the examiner until the nail bed of the finger started to turn pale. As regards touching the margin of joint to determine swelling, 55% agreed, and 14.3% were not sure. Synovial effusion, fluctuation, and the alteration in the range of motion to define inflammation in the examination of joint were important for 47.2% of the examiners. Almost three-quarters agreed with the temporomandibular, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular, shoulder and ankle joint technique. It was obvious that few were in accordance with the technique in the hip joint. When asked about more than one technique in some joints such as the MCF (57.1%) and mid-tarsal (45%) joints, there was a decrease in the percentage of those who agreed with one of the 2 techniques. Discussion: Apparently, there is no standard joint assessment method, since there were different opinions in the techniques proposed. This could be critical since examination of joints is the basis of the clinimetric examination in RA. A significant percentage of the group did not agree or were unsure of some components of the examination. This could lead to a variation in the concepts and a misclassification of patients in order to determine the activity of RA. This would also have an impact on the T2T or treat to target strategy. Conclusion: There was a wide variation in opinions about the concepts related to the examination of joints, such as defining swollen or painful joints in patients suffering RA. This requires a process of standardisation as the best recommended alternative.

N2  - PURPOSE: The hypothesis of this study is that Dynamic Contact Area Ratio of the humerus and glenoid, measured with CT scans, is significantly reduced in patients with anterior shoulder instability compared to the Dynamic Contact Area Ratio in a control group of people without shoulder instability. METHODS: Preoperative CT scans of patients who underwent surgery for anterior shoulder instability were collected. Additionally, the radiologic database was searched for control subjects. Using a validated software tool (Articulis) the CT scans were converted into 3-dimensional models and the amount the joint contact surface during simulated motion was calculated. RESULTS: CT scans of 18 patients and 21 controls were available. The mean Dynamic Contact Area Ratio of patients was 25.2 ± 6.7 compared to 30.1 ± 5.1 in healthy subjects (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: Dynamic Contact Area Ratio was significantly lower in patients with anterior shoulder instability compared to controls, confirming the hypothesis of the study. The findings of this study indicate that calculating the Dynamic Contact Area Ratio based on CT scan images may help surgeons in diagnosing anterior shoulder instability.III.

N2  - Background and aim of the work: The reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) has risen exponentially, this has entailed an increasing number of complications and reoperations. In RSA, loads are transferred directly to the glenoid component. As a result, failure of the glenoid component is one of the most common complications. CT 3D preoperative planning, patient-specific and the possibility of performing a more precise and controlled surgical gesture in the operating room are increasingly important. The use of the GPS navigation on CT 3D planning has proved to be useful above all in terms of accuracy, reliability and the possibility of reproducing the planned gesture preoperatively. Methods: This study analyzes the precision, safety, and reproducibility of the GPS system for the reverse shoulder prosthesis tested on 6 scapulohumeral cadaver specimens, subsequently subjected to anatomical dissection to verify the correct positioning of the glenoid components and the percentage of appropriateness in the field of planning previously virtually assumed. Results: Postoperative macroscopic dissection revealed no central peg perforated or screws malpositioned, no leaking from the bone or injury to the adjacent neurovascular structures. The average length of the screws was 42 mm (range 36 mm to 46 mm) for the lower screw and 40 mm for the upper one (range 36 mm to 42 mm). Conclusions: This cadaver study has shown that GPS navigation offers greater efficiency in baseplate and screws placement and can avoid intra-and postoperative complications. (www.actabiomedica.it).

N2  - Humans exhibit various motor styles that reflect their intra- and interindividual variability when implementing sensorimotor transformations. This opens important questions, such as, At what point should they be readjusted to maintain optimal motor control? Do changes in motor style reveal the onset of a pathological process and can these changes help rehabilitation and recovery? To further investigate the concept of motor style, tests were carried out to quantify posture at rest and motor control in 18 healthy subjects under four conditions: walking at three velocities (comfortable walking, walking at 4 km/h, and race walking) and running at maximum velocity. The results suggest that motor control can be conveniently decomposed into a static component (a stable configuration of the head and column with respect to the gravitational vertical) and dynamic components (head, trunk, and limb movements) in humans, as in quadrupeds, and both at rest and during locomotion. These skeletal configurations provide static markers to quantify the motor style of individuals because they exhibit large variability among subjects. Also, using four measurements (jerk, root mean square, sample entropy, and the two-thirds power law), it was shown that the dynamics were variable at both intra- and interindividual levels during locomotion. Variability increased following a head-to -toe gradient. These findings led us to select dynamic markers that could define, together with static markers, the motor style of a subject. Finally, our results support the view that postural and motor control are subserved by different neuronal networks in frontal, sagittal, and transversal planes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY During human locomotion, motor control can be conveniently decomposed into a static and dynamic components. Variable dynamics were observed at both the intra- and interindividual levels during locomotion. Variability increased following a head-to-toe gradient. Finally, our results support the view that postural and motor control are subserved by different neuronal networks in the frontal, sagittal, and transversal planes.

N2  - Background: Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) is the gold standard to measure early implant migration which is a predictive factor for implant survival. Purpose: To validate an alternative computed tomography (CT) technique to measure implant migration in shoulder arthroplasty. Material and Methods: A cadaver proximal humerus and a scapula, which had tantalum beads incorporated within them, were prepared to accept a short-stemmed humeral component and a two-pegged glenoid component of a commercial total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) system. A five degree of freedom micrometer and goniometer equipped rig was used to translate and rotate the implant components relative to the respective bone to predetermined positions. Double CT examinations were performed for each position and CT motion analysis software (CTMA) was used to assess these movements. The accuracy and precision of the software was estimated using the rig’s micrometers and goniometers as the gold standard. The technique’s effective dose was also assessed. Results: The accuracy was in the range of 0.07–0.23 mm in translation and 0.22–0.71° in rotation. The precision was in the range of 0.08–0.15 mm in translation and 0.23–0.54° in rotation. The mean effective dose for the CT scans was calculated to be 0.27 mSv. Conclusion: In this experimental setting, accuracy, precision, and effective dose of the CTMA technique were found to be comparable to that of RSA. Therefore, we believe clinical studies are warranted to determine if CTMA is a suitable alternative to traditional RSA for migration measurements in TSA.

N2  - Background: The limits of the glenoid track have been defined through methods that do not take properly into account the physiological articular forces involved in the articular contact, which may interfere with its size. Finite elements numerical models can simulate joint forces more realistically. Objective: To evaluate the glenoid track in a finite element numerical model of the shoulder. Methods: We developed a finite element numerical model of the shoulder, based on imaging exams of a volunteer, including the proximal humerus, scapula, their respective articular cartilages, and the rotator cuff muscles. An algorithm to balance the weight of the arm calculated muscle, wrapping, and articular reaction forces. The model has freedom of translation in three axes. The articular contact characteristics and glenoid track's dimensions according to the literature references were evaluated in 60°, 90° and 120° of abduction, all at the 90° external rotation. Results: The model's anatomy and physiology were validated. The value of the glenoid track (according to Yamamoto's parameters) was 86% of glenoid length at 90° abduction before loading of forces, and 79% afterwards. The glenoid track at 60°, 90° and 120° of abduction (Omori's parameters) corresponded, respectively, to 71%, 88% and 104% of glenoid length before loading of forces, and 76%, 84% and 103% afterward. Conclusion: The numerical model is suitable for the shoulder articular contact evaluation. The articular contact analysis ratifies the glenoid track concept and contributes to its evolution. This value is influenced by glenohumeral joint forces, which should be considered for the analysis. Level of evidence: Basic Science Study; Computer Modelling.

N2  - Background: Examine the ability of a dynamic scapular recognition exercise to improve scapular upward rotation and decrease shoulder pain and disability in patients with adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. Methods: A test-retest randomized controlled study design was used. A total of sixty-six patients with unilateral adhesive capsulitis were equally divided into two groups. The study group received a dynamic scapular recognition exercise using a wireless biofeedback system, while the control group received placebo treatment in the form of active range-of-motion (ROM) exercises of the sound upper limb. A digital inclinometer was used to measure the scapular upward rotation and ROM of the shoulder joint, and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) was used to measure the shoulder pain and disability. Results: Study results showed that after two weeks, there were statistically significant differences between the study and control groups in scapular upward rotation and shoulder flexion and abduction (P <.05) and nonsignificant differences in shoulder external rotation and SPADI (P >.05). After two and six months, there were statistically significant differences between study and control groups in scapular upward rotation; shoulder flexion, abduction and external rotation; and SPADI scores (P <.05). Conclusion: This study showed that a dynamic scapular recognition exercise significantly improves scapular upward rotation and the ROM of shoulder flexion and abduction after two weeks. At two and six months, this exercise improves scapular upward rotation; ROM of shoulder flexion, abduction, and external rotation; and SPADI scores. These improvements persisted for six months after the performance of this exercise.

N2  - Background: The aim is to describe a new arthroscopically assisted Latarjet technique. Methods: We evaluated the clinical and radiological findings of 60 patients with chronic recurrent anterior gleno-humeral instability who underwent, between September 2013 and November 2014, an arthroscopically-assisted Latarjet procedure with double round endobutton fixation. Inclusion criteria were: Chronic anterior recurrent instability, Instability Severity Index Score (ISIS) greater than three points, a glenoid bone defect > 15% or a Hill Sachs lesion with concomitant glenoid bone defect > 10%. During surgery the joint capsule and the anterior glenoid labrum were detached. Two drill tunnels perpendicular to the neck of the glenoid were made through a guide. An accessible pilot hole through the glenoid was created to allows the passage of guidewires for coracoid guidance and final fixation onto the anterior glenoid. Through a restricted deltopectoral access a coracoid osteotomy was made. Finally, the graft was prepared, inserted and secured using half-stitches. Results: The mean follow-up was 32.5 months (range 24-32 months). At a mean follow-up, 56 of the 60 subjects claimed a stable shoulder without postoperative complaints, two (3.3%) had an anterior dislocation after new traumatic injury, and two (3.3%) complained of subjective instability. At the latest follow-up, four subjects complained of painful recurrent anterior instability during abduction-external rotation with apprehension. At 1 year, the graft had migrated in one patient (1.7%) and judged not healed and high positioned in another patient (1.7%). Moreover, a glenoid bony gain of 26.3% was recorded. At the latest follow-up, three patients had grade 1 according to Samilson and Prieto classification asymptomatic degenerative changes. Nerve injuries and infections were not detected. None of the 60 patients underwent revision surgery. Healing rate of the graft was 96.7%. Conclusions: This technique of arthroscopically assisted Latarjet combines mini-open and arthroscopic approach for improving the precision of the bony tunnels in the glenoid and coracoid placement, minimizing any potential risk of neurologic complications. It can be an option in subjects with anterior gleno-humeral instability and glenoid bone defect. Further studies should be performed to confirm our preliminary results.

N2  - Background: Accurate and reliable assessment of acromial tilt (ATA) and slope (ASA) angles have been important in the clinical evaluation of degenerative and traumatic rotator cuff tears. This study analyzed the influence of radiographic viewing perspective on the ATA and ASA and developed criteria to identify true lateral (TL) view radiographs. Methods: Three-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) reconstructions of 52 scapulae without rotator cuff tears or osteoarthritis were studied. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were aligned to obtain a TL view. In 10 random scapulae, incremental ante- and retroversion and up- and downward rotation views were generated (10° increments, ±30°), and ATA and ASA were measured by 2 observers. Clinically applicable criteria were developed and validated to identify TL views. Results: The mean ATA and ASA on TL views were 33°±4° (range 23°-42°) and 22°±7° (8°-43°), respectively. Mixed effect models showed that DRRs malpositioned in 20° and 30° anteversion and downward rotation decreased the ATA (P ≤ .030). DRRs malpositioned in anteversion and >10° of up- and downward rotation demonstrated a significantly decreased ASA (P ≤ .047). Intra- and interobserver reliability was excellent for TL views (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥ 0.95) but decreased with increasing viewing angle. Anatomic landmark criteria were capable of identifying TL-view radiographs with sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 82%. Conclusion: Both ATA and ASA were significantly affected by malposition in anteversion and downward rotation of the scapula. Reliable ASA measurement was more susceptible in up- and downward rotation than the ATA. New visual criteria can identify TL-view radiographs and should be used in future studies to ensure consistency in ATA and ASA measurement.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the between-day reliability of the scapular locator for measuring scapular rotations during arm elevation in patients without shoulder pain/conditions/disorders. Methods: Twenty-three asymptomatic individuals were measured during 2 sessions separated by 24 hours. One observer measured scapular position with a scapular locator while participants held their arms at 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120° elevation in the scapular plane. Three trials were performed for each arm position. Results: At 30°, between-day intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for all scapular rotations were poor (ICC 0.10-0.40). At higher arm elevations (60°, 90°, and 120°), ICCs ranged from 0.73 to 0.93 for scapular upward rotation, 0.80 to 0.87 for posterior tilt, and 0.37 to 0.62 for scapular internal rotation. For all scapular rotations, the standard error of measurement was less than 6°, and the smallest detectable difference ranged from 11° to 18°. Conclusion: The findings indicate good to excellent reliability for measuring scapular upward/downward rotation and anterior/posterior tilt between 60° and 120° of shoulder elevation in the scapular plane. However, low reliability was found for all scapular rotations at 30° elevation, and for scapular internal rotation at higher arm elevation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alterations in glenohumeral and scapulothoracic kinematics have been theorized to contribute to rotator cuff pathology by impacting the magnitude of the subacromial space. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to summarize what is currently known about the relationship between shoulder kinematics and subacromial proximities. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of methods have been used to quantify subacromial proximities including photographs, MR imaging, ultrasonography, and single- and bi-plane radiographs. Changes in glenohumeral and scapulothoracic kinematics are associated with changes in subacromial proximities. However, the magnitude and direction of a particular motion's impact on subacromial proximities often vary between studies, which likely reflects different methodologies and subject populations. Glenohumeral elevation angle has been consistently found to impact subacromial proximities. Plane of humeral elevation also impacts subacromial proximities but to a lesser degree than the elevation angle. The impact of decreased scapulothoracic upward rotation on subacromial proximities is not absolute, but instead depends on the angle of humerothoracic elevation. The effects of scapular dyskinesis and humeral and scapular axial rotations on subacromial proximities are less clear. Future research is needed to further investigate the relationship between kinematics and subacromial proximities using more homogenous groups, determine the extent to which compression and other factors contribute to rotator cuff pathology, and develop accurate and reliable clinical measures of shoulder motion.

N2  - Background: This study intends to summarize the causes, clinical examination, and treatments of scapular dyskinesis (SD) and to briefly investigate whether alteration can be managed by a precision rehabilitation protocol planned on the basis of features derived from clinical tests. Methods: We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL and EMBASE databases using various combinations of the keywords “Rotator cuff”, “Scapula”, “Scapular Dyskinesis”, “Shoulder”, “Biomechanics” and “Arthroscopy”. Results: SD incidence is growing in patients with shoulder pathologies, even if it is not a specific injury or directly related to a particular injury. SD can be caused by multiple factors or can be the trigger of shoulder-degenerative pathologies. In both cases, SD results in a protracted scapula with the arm at rest or in motion. Conclusions: A clinical evaluation of altered shoulder kinematics is still complicated. Limitations in observing scapular motion are mainly related to the anatomical position and function of the scapula itself and the absence of a tool for quantitative SD clinical assessment. High-quality clinical trials are needed to establish whether there is a possible correlation between SD patterns and the specific findings of shoulder pathologies with altered scapular kinematics.

N2  - Background: The most commonly used repair techniques to treat an acromioclavicular dislocation imply a suspension mechanism by substituting the supero-inferior oriented coracoclavicular structures with a tight rope mechanism or allograft. Recently, the importance of restoring the antero-posterior stability by addressing the acromioclavicular structures has also been demonstrated. If an in situ repair at the acromioclavicular joint itself could achieve a reposition and would be strong enough, the suspension of the CC structures might become obsolete. Possible advantages would be minimal dissection, lower risk in damaging neurovascular structures, greater stability, reduction of the surgical time and even the possibility of locoregional anesthesia. Hypothesis: In this biomechanical study, the feasibility of different in situ repair techniques is explored thereby testing both compression and translation characteristics. Our hypothesis is that an in situ repair technique results in an adequate repair for the AC joint. Methods and materials: Polyurethane foam blocks will be used as a model for the acromioclavicular joint and the repair techniques will be done by using a combination of sutures and bone anchors or using a transosseous technique. Compression will be measured by means of a Tekscan pressure sensor and translation will be tested in three orthogonal directions using a tensile testing machine. Four different knot anchor configurations (nice knot, surgical knot in two different configurations, Nicky's knot) will be tested for compression. The strongest knot anchor configuration will then be compared side to side with a transosseous configuration for translation. Results: The nice knot in combination with bone anchors provides the strongest compression. In the side to side comparison of a nice knot anchor configuration versus a transosseous nice knot configuration, the transosseous technique shows more resistance to translation. Discussion: An in situ repair by a combination of the nice knot with an anchor or a transosseous nice knot configuration can theoretically be used as a repair technique for an acromioclavicular dislocation. In comparison with existing techniques, this model shows favorable results for translation. Level of evidence: III, controlled laboratory study.

N2  - BackgroundMuscle volume is important in shoulder function. It can be used to estimate shoulder muscle balance in health, pathology, and repair and is indicative of strength based on muscle size. Although prior studies have shown that muscle area on two-dimensional (2-D) images correlates with three-dimensional (3-D) muscle volume, they have not provided equations to predict muscle volume from imaging nor validation of the measurements.Questions/purposesWe wished to create an algorithm that quickly, accurately, and reliably estimates the volume of the shoulder muscles using cross-sectional area on MR images with low error. Specifically, we wished to (1) determine which MR imaging planes provide the highest correlation between shoulder muscle cross-sectional area and volume; (2) derive equations to predict muscle volume from cross-sectional area and validate their predictive capability; and (3) quantify the reliability of muscle cross-sectional area measurement.MethodsThree-dimensional MRI was performed on 10 cadaver shoulders, with sample size chosen for comparison to prior studies of shoulder muscle volume and in consideration of the cost of comprehensive analysis, followed by dissection for muscle volume measurement via water displacement. From each MR series, 3-D models of the rotator cuff and deltoid muscles were generated, and 2-D slices of these muscle models were selected at defined anatomic landmarks. Linear regression equations were generated to predict muscle volume at the plane(s) with the highest correlation between volume and area and for planes identified in prior studies of muscle volume and area. Volume predictions from MR scans of six different cadaver shoulders were also made, after which they were dissected to quantify muscle volume. This validation population allowed the calculation of the predictive error compared with actual muscle volume. Finally, reliability of measuring muscle areas on MR images was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients for inter-rater reliability, as measured between two observers at a single time point.ResultsThe rotator cuff planes with the highest correlation between volume and area were the sum of the glenoid face and the midpoint of the scapula, and for the deltoid, it was the transverse plane at the top of the greater tuberosity. Water and digital muscle volumes were highly correlated (r ≥ 0.993, error < 4%), and muscle areas correlated highly with volumes (r ≥ 0.992, error < 2%). All correlations had p < 0.001. Muscle volume was predicted with low mean error (< 10%). All intraclass correlation coefficients were > 0.925, suggesting high inter-rater reliability in determining muscle areas from MR images.ConclusionDeltoid and rotator cuff muscle cross-sectional areas can be reliably measured on MRI and predict muscle volumes with low error.Clinical RelevanceUsing simple linear equations, 2-D muscle area measurements from common clinical image analysis software can be used to estimate 3-D muscle volumes from MR image data. Future studies should determine if these muscle volume estimations can be used in the evaluation of patient function, changes in shoulder health, and in populations with muscle atrophy. Additionally, these muscle volume estimation techniques can be used as inputs to musculoskeletal models examining kinetics and kinematics of humans that rely on subject-specific muscle architecture.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Decreased pectoralis minor muscle length is common after primary breast cancer treatment and can result in an abnormal position of the scapula. This position can contribute to shoulder pain and pathomechanics and can lead to problems such as impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tears, and frozen shoulder. Currently, there are limited reliable methods for measuring pectoralis minor length. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of measuring pectoralis minor length in women diagnosed with breast cancer. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional reliability and validity study. METHODS: Bilateral pectoralis minor length (in centimeters) was assessed using a palpation meter in women (N = 29) diagnosed with breast cancer by 2 licensed physical therapists who were masked to the measures. Bilateral pectoralis minor length was also measured using a motion capture system to assess validity. RESULTS: Intratester reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC [3,k] = 0.971; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.939-0.986; standard error of measurement [SEM] = 0.16 cm) and intertester reliability (ICC[3,k] = 0.915; 95% CI = 0.81-0.962; SEM = 0.31 cm) were excellent for the palpation meter on the affected side and the unaffected side (intratester reliability: ICC[3,k] = 0.951; 95% CI = 0.897-0.977; SEM = 0.19 cm; intertester reliability: ICC[3,k] = 0.945; 95% CI = 0.877-0.975; SEM = 0.22 cm). Significant correlations were found between the motion capture system and the palpation meter on the affected side (r = 0.87) and the unaffected side (r = 0.81). Bland-Altman plots between the palpation meter and the motion capture system demonstrated that all the measures fell within the limits of agreement. LIMITATIONS: This study encountered possible errors with the accuracy of the motion capture system tracking because of the proximity of the markers and inherent volumetric restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: The palpation meter is a reliable, valid, easily administered, and cost-effective tool for assessing pectoralis minor length in women with breast cancer.

N2  - Hypothesis: This study aimed to examine the reliability and diagnostic discriminative accuracy of 5 different methods that quantity the craniocaudal humeral position with respect to the scapula on conventional radiographs. Methods: In this retrospective, cross-sectional diagnostic study, 2 observers randomly assessed the conventional anteroposterior shoulder radiographs of 280 subjects with rotator cuff imaging for the (1) acromiohumeral (AH) interval, (2) upward migration index (UMI), (3) glenohumeral center-to-center measurement (GHCC), (4) glenohumeral arc measurement (GHa), and (5) scapular spine–humeral head center method (SHC). Reliability was assessed by means of relative consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient) and absolute consistency. Discriminative accuracy for detecting a rotator cuff tear was calculated. Results: Relative consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient) for the AH interval, UMI, GHCC, GHa, and SHC was 0.961, 0.913, 0.806, 0.924, and 0.726, respectively. The AH interval had the highest absolute consistency with a random residual measurement error of 0.58 mm compared with 1.0-3.2 mm for the other measurements. The discriminative accuracy of the AH interval did not significantly differ from that of the UMI (−0.010; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.042 to 0.022; P =.545) but was significantly better than that of the GHCC (0.112; 95% CI, 0.043-0.181; P =.001), GHa (0.074; 95% CI, 0.009-0.139; P =.027), and SHC (0.178; 95% CI, 0.100-0.256; P <.001). Conclusion: Assessment of the craniocaudal humeral position is performed with good to excellent intraobserver and interobserver reliability. The discriminative accuracy for detecting a rotator cuff tear on a single radiograph was highest for the AH interval and UMI. We recommend using the AH interval or UMI as an indirect measure of the presence of a rotator cuff tear on conventional radiographs.

N2  - Adhesive capsulitis (AC) is a glenohumeral (GH) joint condition, characterized by decreased GH joint range of motion (ROM) and compensatory ROM in the elbow and scapulothoracic (ST) joint. To evaluate AC progression in clinical settings, objective movement analysis by available systems would be valuable. This study aimed to assess within-session and intra- and inter-operator reliability/agreement of such a motion capture system. The MVN-Awinda® system from Xsens Technologies (Enschede, The Netherlands) was used to assess ST, GH, and elbow ROM during four tasks (GH external rotation, combing hair, grasping a seatbelt, placing a cup on a shelf) in 10 AC patients (mean age = 54 (± 6), 7 females), on two test occasions (accompanied by different operators on second occasion). Standard error of measurements (SEMs) were below 1.5° for ST pro-retraction and 4.6° for GH in-external rotation during GH external rotation; below 6.6° for ST tilt, 6.4° for GH flexion-extension, 7.1° for elbow flexion-extension during combing hair; below 4.4° for GH ab-adduction, 13° for GH in-external rotation, 6.8° for elbow flexion-extension during grasping the seatbelt; below 11° for all ST and GH joint rotations during placing a cup on a shelf. Therefore, to evaluate AC progression, inertial sensors systems can be applied during the execution of functional tasks.

N2  - Objective: To assess the convergent validity and reliability of joint angle measurements from a new video goniometer iPhone/iPad application separately in adults, older and young children. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Child care and university environments. Participants: Fifty-four adults (mean ± SD=22.5±4.5y), 20 older children (mean ± SD=10.9±2.2y), 20 younger children (mean ± SD=1.6±0.8y) (N=94). Interventions: Adults and older children performed both standardized static positions and functional activities. Younger children performed only a functional activity protocol. Main Outcome Measures: Joint angle measurements using the app were validated against a commercially validated two-dimensional goniometric software program. In addition, validity of the app was compared to a standard mechanical goniometer for the measurement of angles drawn on a white board. Intra- and interrater reliability were assessed through independent rescoring of videos. Results: Correlations between joint angle estimates obtained from the app and goniometer software or a mechanical goniometer were positive and very strong (r>.900; P<.0001). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for repeated scoring from the app indicated excellent intra- and interrater reliability (ICC>.900). Conclusions: High correlations for repeated measures and comparison to gold standard angle measurement instruments suggest that the new app is a valid and reliable tool for assessing joint angles during functional activity. This tool may provide clinicians an inexpensive yet accurate method for quantification of movements and immediate feedback on range of motion during tasks in a natural environment.

N2  - Background: The scapular system free flap has been increasing in popularity to reconstruct short segment mandibular bony defects. It is important to assess donor site morbidities systematically. Methods: Prospective cohort study using objective measures of range of motion (ROM) and shoulder strength were measured. Subjective disability was evaluated with validated questionnaires—Neck Disability Impairment Index and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index. Results: Twenty-six patients were recruited—19 with scapular tip and 7 with lateral border scapular free flap. Decreased ROM on the operated side was noted for shoulder abduction, shoulder flexion, and external rotation. No significant difference was noted for shoulder extension. Strength was reduced for shoulder flexion, shoulder abduction, and external rotation. Subjective measurements did not indicate significant shoulder function disruption. Conclusion: Patients with scapular free flap reconstruction did not experience significant shoulder morbidity. Measures of shoulder ROM and power were objectively affected; however, subjective measures of shoulder disability were not significantly affected.

N2  - Gómez-Carmona, CD, Bastida-Castillo, A, González-Custodio, A, Olcina, G, and Pino-Ortega, J. Using an inertial device (WIMU PRO) to quantify neuromuscular load in running: reliability, convergent validity, and influence of type of surface and device location. J Strength Cond Res 34(2): 365-373, 2020-Currently, the use of accelerometers in sport is increasing, and thus, the devices are required to be valid and reliable. This study tested (a) the reliability and validity of WIMU PRO accelerometers to measure PlayerLoad (PL) and (b) the influence of speed, inertial device location, and type of surface where the incremental test is performed. Twenty resistance-trained men (age: 27.32 ± 6.65 years; height: 1.74 ± 0.03 m; body mass: 68.96 ± 4.37 kg; and body mass index: 22.76 ± 1.11 kg·m) volunteered to participate in the study that lasted 5 weeks. Four progressive incremental tests were performed in treadmill and athletic track conditions. External load variable (PL) and physiological variables (heart rate [HR] and SmO2) were recorded by 4 WIMU PRO inertial devices (scapulae, center of mass, knee, and ankle), a GARMIN HR band, and a MOXY near-infrared spectroscopy device, respectively. High reliability was found on both types of surface, showing the best values at the ankle (treadmill: intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.99, coefficient of variation [CV] = 4.65%; track: ICC = 0.96, CV = 6.54%). A nearly perfect convergent validity was shown with HRAVG (r = 0.99) and a moderate one with SmO2 (r = -0.69). Significant differences in the PL variable between surfaces were reported in all locations except the scapulae (p = 0.173), and the higher values were found on the track. In the analysis per location, the ankle location reported the highest values at all speeds and on the 2 surfaces analyzed. Assessment needs to be individualized, due to the great variability of gait biomechanics among subjects. The accelerometer location should be chosen according to the purpose of the measurement, with the ankle location being recommended for neuromuscular load analysis in running.

N2  - Ultrasonic imaging is a safe, established and non-invasive method to visualise the position of tissues within the body. Coupling existing skin mounted motion capture markers to ultrasound sensors could allow for precise measurement of bone positions and orientations, without the loss in accuracy due to relative displacement between skin and bone present in standard motion capture techniques. This is especially important in motions where skin-based markers alone are impractical or inaccurate, as for tracking scapular position when shoulder abduction is greater than 80 degrees. It is currently unclear how many ultrasound-coupled skin-mounted markers would be required to provide accurate scapular tracking, and where they should be placed. In this study, ultrasound-coupled skin marker quantities and positions were optimised using Monte Carlo and simulated annealing methods. Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine the average target registration error in simulated scapular plane abduction motions for groups ranging from 1 to 40 ultrasound-coupled sensors. After the range of ideal sensor quantities was identified, a simulated annealing algorithm was used to identify optimal positions for the sensors. Using these positions, a single skin-mounted, ultrasound-coupled sensor placed over the acromion was found to reduce simulated registration errors by 40.5% compared to regular skin-mounted markers. Groups consisting of three or more sensors reduced simulated registration error at maximum scaption to sub-millimeter levels.

N2  - The Scapula Reposition Test (SRT) is proposed to determine if a relationship exists between scapular dyskinesis and shoulder pathology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the SRT in subjects with rotator cuff tendinopathy and scapular dyskinesis. In addition, we compared subjective strength findings from the test to an objective measure made by dynamometry. The SRT was independently and randomly performed by two physical therapists in 42 subjects. The percent agreement, Cohen’s kappa (κ), maximum attainable κ, prevalence and bias indexes, and prevalence-adjusted-bias-adjusted kappa were used as intra-and inter-rater reliability estimates. Finally, the point-biserial correlation coefficient (rpb) was used for correlation analysis of objective and subjective strength findings. A moderate intra-rater (κ = 0.43; CI 95%, 0.14 to 0.73; p = 0.004) and poor inter-rater (κ = 0.08; CI 95%, −0.22 to 0.38; p = 0.61) agreement was found. Subjective strength changes during SRT and dynamometry were poorly correlated (rpb = 0.137; CI 95%, −0.175 to 0.423; p = 0.389). The SRT cannot be recommended for clinical practice. More studies evaluating its reliability are needed as well as further research on the capability of a rater to manually detect strength changes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The Bristow-Lataijet technique is a reliable treatment for recurrent anterior shoulder instability. However, it as been reported 1.6% of patients suffering nerve injury. Thereafter, the all-arthroscopic Latarjet procedure has been gaining popularity, but the surgeon is unable to palpate the nerves, and their localization, so protection is a difficulty. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the CT localization of suprascapular nerve on the posterosuperior scapular neck, and to improve the safety and quality in Bristow-Latarjet surgery. METHODS: This study was carried out on 12 normal formalin fixed adult cadaveric upper limb specimens (8 males and 4 females). The study was in accordance with the ethical requirements of Dongguan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The nerve trunk and branches were marked with developing lines to examine the position and course of nerve on the posterosuperior scapular neck. CT localization was used to measure the distance, angle and height ratio to glenoid from the superior pole of scapula, spinoglenoid notch, the entry point of outermost nerve branch to anterior and posterior margin of the glenoid, through internally and externally rotating 45 degrees of should joints. The data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Pearson correlation analysis: The height of glenoid was positively correlated with the distance from the spinoglenoid notch and entrance point to the articular surface. (2) Comparison between internal and external rotation 45 degrees: Distance of superior pole of scapula and angles showed no significant difference (all P > 0.05). There were significant differences in the distance and angle in the spinoglenoid notch (all P < 0.01), but height ratio was not significantly different (P > 0.05). There were significant differences in distance, angle, and height ratio at entrance point (all P < 0.01), suggesting that external rotation had larger angle and safer range of distance than internal rotation. In the position of internal and external rotation 45 degrees, the distance, angle and height ratio of spinoglenoid notch and entrance point showed significant differences (P < 0.01), indicating that compared with spinoglenoid notch, the angle between entrance point and articular surface was smaller, the distance from entrance point to articular surface was shorter, and the height ratio was higher. (4) Therefore, external rotation is recommended in the case of internal fixation of the bony tunnel for the posterior glenoid so as to reduce the incidence of nerve injury.

N2  - Purpose: To use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for fully automated MRI segmentation of the glenohumeral joint and evaluate the accuracy of three-dimensional (3D) MRI models created with this method. Materials and Methods: Shoulder MR images of 100 patients (average age, 44 years; range, 14–80 years; 60 men) were retrospectively collected from September 2013 to August 2018. CNNs were used to develop a fully automated segmentation model for proton den-sity–weighted images. Shoulder MR images from an additional 50 patients (mean age, 33 years; range, 16–65 years; 35 men) were retrospectively collected from May 2014 to April 2019 to create 3D MRI glenohumeral models by transfer learning using Dixon-based sequences. Two musculoskeletal radiologists performed measurements on fully and semiautomated segmented 3D MRI models to assess glenohumeral anatomy, glenoid bone loss (GBL), and their impact on treatment selection. Performance of the CNNs was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), sensitivity, precision, and surface-based distance measurements. Measurements were compared using matched-pairs Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: The two-dimensional CNN model for the humerus and glenoid achieved a DSC of 0.95 and 0.86, a precision of 95.5% and 87.5%, an average precision of 98.6% and 92.3%, and a sensitivity of 94.8% and 86.1%, respectively. The 3D CNN model, for the humerus and glenoid, achieved a DSC of 0.95 and 0.86, precision of 95.1% and 87.1%, an average precision of 98.7% and 91.9%, and a sensitivity of 94.9% and 85.6%, respectively. There was no difference between glenoid and humeral head width fully and semi-automated 3D model measurements (P value range, .097–.99). Conclusion: CNNs could potentially be used in clinical practice to provide rapid and accurate 3D MRI glenohumeral bone models and GBL measurements.

N2  - Objectives. Proprioceptive training is popularly applied as a therapeutic exercise method in physiotherapy. Its effects on pain and range of motion are only poorly evaluated. Therefore, this study assesses the effectiveness of proprioceptive training with an Eye-Cervical Re-education Program to decrease pain and increase the joint range in chronic neck pain patients. Material and Methods. Design. A randomized, no-blinded, controlled clinical trial. Setting. Physiotherapy consultation. Participants. 44 people were divided into two groups. Interventions. All patients were treated with a multimodal physiotherapy intervention. The experimental group was supplemented with an exercise program that included eye-cervical proprioception. Outcomes. The primary outcomes included pain pressure thresholds (upper trapezius, levator scapulae, and splenius capitis) and cervical range of motion. The secondary outcomes included pain measured by the Visual Analogical Scale and the McGillSpv Questionnaire. Results. The proprioception treatment was effective in reducing the pain pressure threshold in the right upper trapezius (p=0.001), left upper trapezius (p=0.014), right levator scapula (p=0.040), and left splenius capitis (p=0.021). The increase in the joint range was statistically significant (p<0.05) in favor of the Eye-Cervical Re-education Program for all movements assessed. Conclusions. The Eye-Cervical Re-education Program is effective at relieving pain pressure thresholds in the upper trapezius, right levator scapula, and left splenius capitis and especially effective for increasing the cervical range of motion. This trial is registered with NCT03197285 (retrospective registration).

N2  - Background. The frequency of occurrence of dislocation of the shoulder joint is the highest among that for all other limb joints. Simultaneously, recurrent instability of the shoulder joint develops majorly in children and adolescents, which, in the future, lead to the development of persistent pain syndrome. Past evidence indicate that the features of the spatial positioning of the articular process of the scapula can be considered as a risk factor toward the development of instability in the shoulder joint among adult patients. However, there is no reliable data in the literature regarding the influence of tilt and rotation of the shoulder blade glenoid on the occurrence of instability in the shoulder joint among children and adolescents.  Encouraged, we undertook this subject for our study. Aim. To clarify the impact of changes in the version and inclination of the glenoid on the instability of the shoulder joint among children. Materials and methods. We analyzed the survey data of 42 children with a habitual dislocation of the shoulder of traumatic and atraumatic origins. The average ages of the examined children were 15.57 ± 1.75 and 15.07 ± 1.64 years, respectively, for those with shoulder instability of traumatic and atraumatic origins, respectively. Results. Statistical data processing revealed no significant differences in the versioning and inclination of the glenoid process between the groups with traumatic and atraumatic instabilities of the shoulder joint. Notably, the average values of versioning and inclination indicators were in the normal range. Conclusion. Based on our results, we suggest that, in the childhood, the dynamic and static soft tissue stabilizers of the shoulder joint play the leading role in the formation of instability of the shoulder joint.

N2  - Introduction: Treatment of proximal humeral fractures with plate osteosynthesis or intramedullary nail fixation in humeral shaft fractures with a proximal locking bolt carries the risk of iatrogenic injury of the axillary nerve. The purpose of this anatomical study is to define a more reliable safe zone to prevent iatrogenic axillary nerve injury using the humeral head instead of the acromion as a (radiographic) reference point during operative treatment. Materials and methods: Anatomical dissection and labeling of the axillary nerve and branches was performed on 10 specially embalmed human specimens. Standard AP and straight lateral radiographs were made. The distances were measured indirectly from the cranial tip of the humerus to the axillary nerve on radiographs. Results: The median distance from the cranial tip of the humerus to the axillary nerve was 52 mm. The mean number of axillary nerve branches was 3. The distances from the cranial tip of the humerus to the nerve (branch) varied from 23 to 78 mm. The median distance from the proximal (anterior) branch was 36 mm, to the second branch 47 mm, 54 mm to the third branch and 73 mm to the fourth branch. The axillary nerve moves along with the humerus in cranial and caudal direction when the subacromial space varies. Conclusion: This study shows that the position of the axillary nerve can be better determent using the cranial tip of the humerus as a reference point instead of the acromion. Furthermore, it is unsafe to place the proximal locking bolts in the zone between 24 mm and 78 mm from the cranial tip of the humerus. The greatest chance to cause a lesion of the main branch of the axillary nerve is in the zone between 48 mm and 58 mm caudal from the tip of the humeral head.

N2  - Pedestrians are the most vulnerable road user and represent about 23% of the road traffic deaths in the world. A finite element (FE) model corresponding to a 5th percentile female pedestrian (F05-PS) was developed by morphing the Global Human Body Models Consortium (GHBMC) 50th percentile male pedestrian (M50-PS) model to the reconstructed geometry of a recruited small female subject. The material properties of the pedestrian model were assigned based on GHBMC M50-PS model. In model validation, the knee lateral stiffness and force time histories of F05-PS upper body showed similar trends, but softer responses than the corresponding data recorded in post mortem human surrogate (PMHS) tests and linearly scaled to average male anthropometry. Finally, the pedestrian model was verified in a Car-to-Pedestrian Collison (CPC) simulation. The marker trajectories recorded in simulation were close to the data recorded on small PMHS in testing and the model predicted typical knee ligament ruptures. Therefore, we believe the F05-PS model, the first FE model developed based on a female reconstructed geometry, could be used to improve vehicle front-end design for pedestrian protection and/or to investigate various pedestrian accidents.

N2  - Background: A musculocutaneous nerve (MCN) injury is a rare complication of the Latarjet procedure. Most of these injuries are neurapraxias and resolve with time; however, permanent injuries can occur. Understanding the anatomy and relationship of the MCN to the coracoid process is essential to prevent injuries. Purpose: To provide realistic, in situ–referenced measurements for the Latarjet procedure. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: A total of 12 matched-pair cadaveric specimens (24 fresh-frozen shoulders) were dissected. Coracoid osteotomy was performed, and the MCN and its respective twigs were identified. Measurements were made from the coracoid process to the entry site of the nerve twigs and trunk into the coracobrachialis muscle. Results: Overall, 70.8% of specimens had twigs; however, there was a discrepancy in the presence (41.7%) and number (75.0%) of twigs in the paired specimens. The most proximal twigs were, on average, 33.5 ± 8.1 mm (range, 21.9-47.6 mm) from the coracoid process. The main trunk was, on average, 51.1 ± 14.4 mm (range, 16.7-71.9 mm) from the coracoid process. In 33.3% of specimens, the nerve entered the coracobrachialis at a distance shorter than 5 cm below the coracoid process, and this increased to 91.7% when the twigs were accounted for. Conclusion: The previously described safe zone of 5 cm below the coracoid process may not be reliable to protect the MCN or its twigs. Using 3 cm would decrease the chances of damaging a twig or the main trunk. In 33.3% of the specimens, the nerve entered the coracobrachialis at a distance shorter than 5 cm below the coracoid process, and this increased to 91.7% when twigs were accounted for. Clinical Relevance: As the Latarjet procedure is an emerging technique, it is essential to be aware of the anatomic structures and the relation between different neural structures to anatomic points of reference. Therefore, the results of this study add significant information for a safe surgical procedure for the majority of patients suffering from shoulder instability.

N2  - Introduction: Assessing spinal deformities using an X-ray radiation is the method of choice for posture diagnosis. It is also used for the evaluation of the degree of correction, brace fit, and spinal balance as well as for further management decisions. However, multiple X-ray exposures during control visits could be too burdensome for children. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the precision and repeatability of measurement of the variables obtained by a fast, simple postural evaluation in children by the SpinalMeter. Material and methods: The measurements of the angle of trunk rotation (ATR) and SpinalMeter posture assessments were performed 8 to 10 times in a short period of time (6 s). The overall of 300 photos (SpinalMeter) and 1020 measurements (asymmetry, distance between anthropometric points as well as ATR) were obtained from 6 girls (8–15 years old). The validation study comprised of the repeatability, interclass correlation coefficient (Qw) and relative standard deviation (rSD) measurements. Results and discussion: The measurements of the distance between acro-mion–popliteal fossa, acromion–iliac crest, and acromion–posterior superior iliac spine obtained by SpinalMeter were clearly repeatable (Qw > 0.9). The scapular and pelvic asymmetry in standing and sitting positions were highly repeatable and had low rSD (e.g. for scapular asymmetry 5.6%–80.3%; Qw > 0.8). Conclusions: The precise and reliable postural biometrical measurements were performed by SpinalMeter in the case of the distance between anthropo-metric points and asymmetry of pelvis and scapula. These measurements could be useful in the assessment of girl’s posture when visiting the pediatrician.

N2  - Objective. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) affects 1%-4% of adolescents in the early stages of puberty, but there is still no effective prediction method. This study aimed to establish a prediction model and validated the accuracy and efficacy of this model in predicting the occurrence of AIS. Methods. Data was collected from a population-based school scoliosis screening program for AIS in China. A sample of 884 children and adolescents with the radiological lateral Cobb angle≥10° was classified as an AIS case, and 895 non-AIS subjects with a Cobb angle<10° were randomly selected from the screening system. All selected subjects were screened by visual inspection of clinical signs, the Adam's forward-bending test (FBT), and the measurement of angle of trunk rotation (ATR). LR and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to preliminarily screen the influential factors, and LR models with different adjusted weights were established to predict the occurrence of AIS. Results. Multivariate LR and ROC curves indicated that angle of thoracic rotation (adjusted odds ratios AOR=5.18-10.06), angle of thoracolumbar rotation (AOR=4.67-7.22), angle of lumbar rotation (AOR=6.97-8.09), scapular tilt (area under the curve AUC=0.77, 95% CI: 0.75-0.80), shoulder-height difference, lumbar concave, and pelvic tilt were the risk predictors for AIS. LR models with different adjusted weights (by AOR, AUC, and AOR+AUC) performed similarly in predicting the occurrence of AIS compared with multivariate LR. The sensitivity (82.55%-83.27%), specificity (82.59%-83.33%), Youden's index (0.65-0.67), positive predictive value (82.85%-83.58%), negative predictive value (82.29%-83.03%), and total accuracy (82.57%-83.30%) manifested that LR could accurately identify patients with AIS. Conclusions. LR model is a relatively high accurate and feasible method for predicting AIS. Increased performance of LR models using clinically relevant variables offers the potential to early identify high-risk groups of AIS.

N2  - Background: Increased passive deltoid tension after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) potentially leads to displacement or tilting of a preexisting os acromiale. Purpose: To analyze patients with an os acromiale who underwent RTSA and compare their outcomes and complications with a matched control group without an os acromiale. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: In this study, 45 shoulders in 42 patients with an os acromiale (cases) were matched to 133 patients without os acromiale (controls) who underwent RTSA between 2005 and 2016. The mean follow-up was 52 ± 32 months. Matching criteria included sex, type of surgery, duration of follow-up, and age. The Constant score (CS), Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV), and radiological outcomes were assessed postoperatively at 1-year, 2-year, and final follow-up visits. Results: The mean CS, SSV, and range of motion improved from preoperative levels to the final follow-up in both groups (P <.01). Patients with an os acromiale had a relative CS of 70 ± 23 versus 76 ± 21 points (P =.15) and an SSV of 70 ± 30 versus 73 ± 24 (P =.52) compared with controls at the final follow-up visit. Patients with an os acromiale had significantly decreased active flexion of 104° ± 33° versus 114° ± 33° (P =.03) at 1 year and active abduction of 103° ± 37° versus 121° ± 38° at 2 years postoperatively (P =.02). A postoperatively painful os acromiale was found in 12 cases (27%) and spontaneously resolved in 8 cases after a mean of 33 months (range, 12-47 months; P =.04). Conclusion: RTSA reliably restores patient satisfaction despite the presence of an os acromiale, with a slightly impaired range of motion. Postoperative local tenderness at the os acromiale can be expected in 1 out of 4 patients, but this resolves spontaneously over time in the majority of patients.

N2  - Background: Predictive variables associated with the effects of a scapular conscious control program should be identified and used to guide rehabilitation programs. Purpose: To determine whether potential factors are associated with the success of scapular muscle balance with an early control program in patients with subacromial pain and scapular dyskinesis. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 38 amateur overhead athletes with subacromial pain and medial border prominence were recruited. They performed progressive conscious control of scapular orientation during 45° and 90° of arm elevation. Stepwise logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve were used to determine the optimal cutoff point of related factors for success or failure of the program. Potential factors including pain level during activity, pain duration, anterior/posterior shoulder flexibility, forward shoulder posture, posterior displacement of root of spine and inferior angle, scapular kinematics, and muscle activation before conscious control program were recorded as independent variables. Successful control defined as decreases of the upper trapezius/serratus anterior ratio in 2 consecutive trials of the 90° program or failure in the program was used as a dependent variable. Results: Having a posterior displacement of the inferior angle of the scapula of ≤16.4 mm and scapular posterior tipping during arm elevation of ≤3.3° (collected before the control program) were associated with the success of the program (R2 = 0.286; P <.05). Additionally, participants with each or both variables present at baseline had probabilities of success of 78% and 95%, respectively. Conclusion: The value of scapular posterior displacement and posterior tilt should be considered before early scapular control program. Other factors related to the success of the program should be found due to the limited variance explained in the regression model.

N2  - Introduction: Scapular asymmetry may affect the biomechanics of the shoulder girdle joints and muscles by changing the contraction angles of the muscles. The purpose of this prospective cohort, matched-controlled study was to compare shoulder muscle strength, proprioception sense and internal/external rotation flexibility between adolescent athletes with and without scapular asymmetry. Material and methods: Nineteen athletes of tennis, fencing, shooting, archery, gymnastics, and badminton branches with left side (non-dominant) scapular asymmetry were included in the study as asymmetry group. Nineteen athletes who have similar gender, sports branch, professional experience, physical characteristics with asymmetry group were included in the study as the control group. Scapular asymmetry was measured using a tape measure with the Lateral Scapular Slide Test. Shoulder horizontal abduction/adduction isokinetic muscle strength and shoulder abduction/adduction isometric muscle strength was tested by an isokinetic dynamometer. The proprioception sense of the glenohumeral joint was evaluated with a digital inclinometer, and the flexibility of the internal and external rotation of the shoulder was evaluated by the flexibility test. Results: There was not any significant difference between the groups in isokinetic muscle strength, isometric muscle strength, and proprioception sense of shoulder (p > 0.05). Shoulder internal rotation flexibility of both dominant and nondominant sides was higher in the asymmetry group than the control group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: It was determined that the flexibility of shoulder internal rotation in adolescent athletes with scapular asymmetry was higher than those without asymmetry.

N2  - Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is an effective treatment for glenohumeral (GH) osteoarthritis. However, it still suffers from a substantial rate of mechanical failure, which may be related to cyclic off-center loading of the humeral head on the glenoid. In this work, we present the design and evaluation of a GH joint robotic simulator developed to study GH translations. This five-degree-of-freedom robot was designed to replicate the rotations (±40 deg, accuracy 0.5 deg) and three-dimensional (3D) forces (up to 2 kN, with a 1% error settling time of 0.6 s) that the humeral implant exerts on the glenoid implant. We tested the performances of the simulator using force patterns measured in real patients. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of different orientations of the glenoid implant on joint stability. When simulating realistic dynamic forces and implant orientations, the simulator was able to reproduce stable behavior by measuring the translations of the humeral head of less than 24 mm with respect to the glenoid implant. Simulation with quasi-static forces showed dislocation in extreme ranges of implant orientation. The robotic GH simulator presented here was able to reproduce physiological GH forces and may therefore be used to further evaluate the effects of glenoid implant design and orientation on joint stability.

N2  - Rationale:Calcific tendinopathy is one of the most frequent causes of nontraumatic shoulder pain. However, intra-articular calcifications appear to be an infrequent condition. We herein report a rare case study of an intra-articular calcification of the acromioclavicular joint.Patient concerns:A 46-year-old man presented with an acute pain in the anterior superior region of the left shoulder which also radiated to the left cervical region. The man during the physical evaluation also presented severe functional limitation of the shoulder movements in all planes of motion.Diagnoses:The diagnosis was carried out through a radiographic and an echotomographic examination, highlighting the intra-articular calcific formation associated to a reactive inflammatory reaction.Interventions:An ultrasound-guided percutaneous treatment following the guidelines for calcific tendinopathy of the shoulder was carried out.Outcomes:The posttreatment was satisfactory with the disappearance of the pain and the recovery of the shoulder movements in all planes of motion.Lessons:We can affirm that the ultrasound-guided percutaneous treatment in patients with calcification of the acromion-clavicular joint represents a valid and nonpainful therapeutic treatment.

N2  - The six known specimens of Scleromochlus taylori and casts made from their negative impressions were examined to reassess the osteological evidence that has been used to interpret Scleromochlus’s locomotion and phylogenetic relationships. It was found that the trunk was dorsoventrally compressed. The upper temporal fenestra was on the lateral surface of skull and two-thirds the size of the lower, the jaw joint posteriorly placed with short retroarticular process, and teeth short and subconical, but no evidence of external nares or antorbital fossae was found. The posterior trunk was covered with ~20 rows of closely spaced transversely elongate dorsal osteoderms. The coracoid was robust and elongate. The acetabulum was imperforate and the femoral head hemispherical and only weakly inturned such that the hip joint was unsuited to swinging in a parasagittal plane. The presence of four distal tarsals is confirmed. The marked disparity of tibial and fibular shaft diameters and of proximal tarsal dimensions indicates that the larger proximal tarsal is the astragalus and the significantly smaller tarsal is the calcaneum. The astragalus and calcaneum bear little resemblance to those of Lagosuchus, and the prominent calcaneal tuber confirms that the ankle was crurotarsal. There is no evidence that preserved body and limb postures are unnatural, and most specimens are preserved in what is interpreted as a typical sprawling resting pose. A principal component analysis of skeletal measurements of Scleromochlus and other vertebrates of known locomotor type found Scleromochlus to plot with frogs, and that finding combined with skeletal morphology suggests Scleromochlus was a sprawling quadrupedal hopper. Phylogenetic analyses found that Scleromochlus was not an ornithodiran, but was either within the Doswelliidae or outside the clade consisting of the most recent common ancestor of the Erythrosuchidae and Archosauria and all its descendants.

N2  - Background: Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRFs) is increasing in popularity. During the operation, disruption of the chest wall musculature occurs, which may affect chest wall and glenohumeral–scapular movement. Although postoperative physical therapy (PT) is widely recommended, specific, validated, protocols for SSRF patients do not exist. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a PT protocol specifically designed for SSRF patients. Methods: This was a pilot study of all SSRF patients admitted to a single level-I trauma center between December 2017 and February 2019. Included patients received a PT evaluation within 72 h of operation. This evaluation included implementation of specific PT interventions and a written home exercise program. Objective measures included: patient reported pain scores, shoulder strength, chest expansion, spirometry, and the disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) survey. These measures were obtained at initial inpatient evaluation, 1–week and 1–month post discharge in an outpatient visit, and at 3 months through telephone DASH survey. Results: Nineteen patients were analyzed. Patients were primarily male (74%), suffering from blunt trauma, with a median 8 (interquartile range [IQR]: 7–10) rib fractures and Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 17 (12–23). The median (IQR) time from SSRF to PT evaluation was 1 (1–2) day. Median chest expansion doubled from PT evaluation to 1–month follow–up (1.9 cm PT evaluation; 2.5 cm 1 week; 4.5 cm 1–month, P = 0.014). The median age-predicted spirometry improved from 29% preoperatively, to 38% at PT evaluation and to 86% at 1-month postdischarge (P ≤ 0.05 for the trend). Shoulder strength improved from PT evaluation to 1–month follow–up. The median DASH scoring improved at all follow–up intervals, with no clinically significant functional impairments at 3 months (86 on PT evaluation; 56 at 1–week, 21 at 1–month; 8 at 3–month phone interview). Conclusion: A specific, novel, PT protocol for patients after SSRF appears to be feasible and safe. Our results demonstrate a significant decrease in patient-perceived disability, improved shoulder strength, chest expansion, and spirometry compared to immediate postoperative levels. Although we cannot determine the effect of the protocol on recovery, our results provide the preliminary data on which to base a larger, randomized trial to determine if a beneficial effect of the protocol is present.

N2  - Background: Reduced range of motion in the shoulder can be a source of functional limitation. The use of inertial sensors to quantify movement in addition to more common clinical assessments of the shoulder may allow clinicians to understand that they are potentially unnoticed by visual identification. The aim of this study was to generate an explanatory model for shoulder abduction based on data from inertial sensors. Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out to generate an explanatory model of shoulder abduction based on data from inertial sensors. Shoulder abduction of thirteen older adults suffering from shoulder dysfunction was recorded with two inertial sensors placed on the humerus and scapula. Movement variables (maximum angular mobility, angular peak of velocity, peak of acceleration) were used to explain the functionality of the upper limb assessed using the Upper Limb Functional Index (ULFI). The abduction movement of the shoulder was explained by six variables related to the mobility of the shoulder joint complex. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to explain the results obtained on the functionality of the upper limb. Results: The MANOVA model based on angular mobility explained 69% of the variance of the ULFI value (r-squared = 0.69). The most relevant variables were the abduction-adduction of the humerus and the medial/lateral rotation of the scapula. Conclusions: The method used in the present study reveals the potential importance of the analysis of the scapular and humeral movements for comprehensive evaluation of the upper limb. Further research should include a wider sample and may seek to use this assessment technique in a range of potential clinical applications.

N2  - Biomechanical investigations examining shoulder function commonly observe a high degree of inter-individual variability in muscle activity and kinematic patterns during static and dynamic upper extremity exertions. Substantial differences in musculoskeletal geometry between individuals can alter muscle moment arms and lines of action that, theoretically, alter muscle activity and shoulder kinematics. The purposes of this research were to: (i) quantify model-predicted functional roles (moment arms, lines of action) of the scapulohumeral muscles, (ii) compare model predictions to experimental data in the literature, and (iii) evaluate sensitivity of muscle functional roles due to changes in muscle attachment locations using probabilistic modeling. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to iteratively adjust muscle attachment locations at the clavicle, scapula, and humerus of the Delft Shoulder and Elbow Model in OpenSim. Muscle moment arms and lines of action were quantified throughout arm elevation in the scapular plane. In general, model-predicted moment arms agreed well with the reviewed literature; however, notable inconsistencies were observed when comparing lines of action. Variability in moment arms and lines of action were muscle-specific, with 2 standard deviations in moment arm and line of actions as high as 25.8 mm and 18.8° for some muscles, respectively. Moment arms were particularly sensitive to changes in attachment site closest to the joint centre. Variations in muscle functional roles due to differences in musculoskeletal geometry are expected to require different muscle activity and movement patterns for upper extremity exertions.

N2  - Background: Pronounced lateral differences in musculoskeletal loading are widely considered a risk factor for the onset of various overuse injuries in the lower limbs in long-distance running. In a recent study, we described an innovative, easy-to-employ measurement setup based on commercially available inertial measurement units (IMUs) to assess tibial, sacral and scapular accelerations as well as possible asymmetries therein and to evaluate shock attenuation during running. We formerly employed the system under laboratory conditions as part of regular performance diagnostics for junior elite long-distance runners. Material and methods: In this case report, we use that system to evaluate tibial and scapular loading of two athletes from the same cohort under field conditions during a high-altitude training camp. The athletes were chosen by their coach because of visually suspected pronounced asymmetries. We monitored the biomechanical loading of two athletes in four different high-altitude training sessions, ranging from low-intensity, flat gravel running to high-intensity interval training on an inclined asphalt road. Results: Pronounced intra-individual differences in peak tibial and scapular accelerations were found for the two athletes, depending mainly on the slope of the running course and the running speed. In both cases, highest peak tibial accelerations were observed for downhill running (19 ± 2, g ≈ 9.81 m s−1). Visually suspected lateral asymmetries in tibial and scapular loading were objectively confirmed, reaching maximum values of 39% and 53%, respectively, depending on the particular session. While for Athlete 1, highest tibial asymmetries were observed for running on a flat track (39%), asymmetries for Athlete 2 were highest for running downhill (13%). Comparing the IMU data to laboratory-based isokinetic strength testing, it is suggested that lateral asymmetries in acceleration load in running may be linked to asymmetries in muscular knee extension strength. Conclusions: IMUs are a practical, reliable and easy-to-employ tool for evaluating musculoskeletal loading in running, especially under demanding training conditions in the field. In summary, the results of this case report suggest that the individual extent of asymmetries in tibial and scapular loading during running may be linked to exercise characteristics, intensity and probably also to an imbalance in isolated knee-extension capabilities. Level of Evidence: V.

N2  - The advancement of technologies in orthopaedic surgery should provide the surgeon with precise and trustworthy support for pre-operative planning, intra-operative guidance and post-operative follow-up. The request for greater accuracy, predictable results and fewer complications, is the engine of digital evolution in pre-operative planning and computer-assisted surgery (CAS). It is an evolution rather than a revolution, and in the last few years these developments have begun to involve shoulder replacement surgery, too.

N2  - Background: This study aims to evaluate the influence of stabilization of acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation through the modified Weaver-Dunn technique and coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments using the finite element method. The goal is to determine which surgical technique allows behavior that is most similar to the joint, guaranteeing the necessary stability without restricting joint movements for the considered conditions. Methods: The analysis is based on the three-dimensional finite element models. The control group of this study is represented by a three-dimensional model of the whole structure based on finite element methods. Findings: The finite element models showed the stress and displacement values found in the intact acromioclavicular joint and surgical procedures. It was concluded that transferring the coracoacromial ligament to stabilize the acromioclavicular joint did not have a positive impact on the outcome. Interpretation: The finite element analysis on the treatment of acromioclavicular dislocation presented here provides medical teams with new parameters for choosing a suitable surgical procedure in the occurrence of acromioclavicular dislocation. The development and validation of the finite element models allow the variation of the conditions and enables different surgical configurations to be simulated.

N2  - Optimal scapular position and movement are necessary for normal function of the shoulder joint and it is essential to focus on scapula in the rehabilitation for shoulder disorders. The aim of this study was to discover the relationship between the scapular initial position and scapular movement during dynamic motions in healthy young men. Thirty-four men participated in this study. The scapular angles at initial position and in elevation and lowering during flexion and abduction were measured using an electromagnetic tracking device. The scapular movements from 30° to 120° during flexion and abduction were calculated. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used to analyze the relationship between the scapular initial position and scapular movements. For upward rotation and posterior tilt of the scapula, there were significant positive correlations between the scapular initial position and scapular movement during flexion and abduction. For internal rotation, there were significant positive correlations, except 90° in lowering phase and 120° in both phases. While the humeral elevation increased, the correlation coefficients tended to decrease. Except for the internal rotation our results clarified the interactions between the scapular initial position and scapular movement during dynamic motions in healthy young men. The tendency of the decrease in correlation coefficient with elevation angle was shown.

N2  - PURPOSE: To systematize the surgical outcomes of anatomic and non-anatomic reconstruction in patients with chronic acromio-clavicular joint (ACJ) instability and determine which technique is superior. METHODS: This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to April 30th, 2018 for original articles that assessed the outcomes of one or more surgical techniques of anatomic and non-anatomic reconstruction in patients with chronic ACJ instability. The Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) was used to assess study quality. Pre-to-post meta-analysis was performed for both anatomic and non-anatomic reconstructions. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included comprising 799 patients (mean age of 36.6 years old and 84% males) with a mean follow-up of 34.6 months (range 13 to 74). Surgical techniques included anatomic (tendinous or synthetic grafts/constructs) and non-anatomic reconstruction (Weaver-Dunn or Modified Weaver-Dunn, conjoined tendon transfer, or temporary hook plate). There were significant pre-to-post improvements on the constant score with an average improvement ranging from 11.1 to 50.7 (p < 0.01). Average failure rate was 7.6% (7.5% for anatomic and 8.5% for non-anatomic reconstruction). Non-comparative studies had a mean MINORS score of 9 points (out of 16) and comparative studies 17 (out of 24) with excellent interrater agreement (k = 0.910). CONCLUSION: Both anatomic and non-anatomic ACJ reconstructions provide significant post-operative improvements, but definitive conclusions on optimal technique remain elusive. Notwithstanding, comparative studies support the use of anatomic ACJ reconstruction which should be preferably used. However, until superiority is demonstrated by robust studies, surgeons should supplement their decision-making with experience and patient preference.IV.

N2  - Purpose: Coracoid fractures represent approximately 3–13% of all scapular fractures. Open reduction and internal fixation can be indicated for a coracoid base fracture. This procedure is challenging due to the nature of visualization of the coracoid with fluoroscopy. The aim of this study was to develop a fluoroscopic imaging protocol, which helps surgeons in finding the optimal insertion point and screw orientation for fixations of coracoid base fractures, and to assess its feasibility in a simulation study. Methods: A novel imaging protocol was defined for screw fixation of coracoid base fractures under fluoroscopic guidance. The method is based on finding the optimal view for screw insertion perpendicular to the viewing plane. In a fluoroscopy simulation environment, eight orthopaedic surgeons were invited to place a screw down the coracoid stalk through the coracoid base and into the neck of 14 cadaveric scapulae using anatomical landmarks. The surgeons placed screws before and after they received an e-learning of the optimal view. Results of the two sessions were compared and inter-rater reliability was calculated. Results: Screw placement was correct in 33 out of 56 (58.9%) before, and increased to 50 out of 56 (89.3%) after the coracoid tunnel view was explained to the surgeons, which was a significant improvement (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our newly developed fluoroscopic view based on simple landmarks is a useful addendum in the orthopaedic surgeon’s tool box to fixate fractures of the coracoid base.

N2  - Recurrent instability after anterior shoulder stabilization surgery is not an uncommon complication, with variable rates of recurrences associated with different surgical procedures. The Latarjet procedure continues to be the gold standard in the management of anterior instability with significant glenoid bone loss, although a recent trend toward arthroscopic anatomic glenoid reconstruction (AAGR) with distal tibial allograft has been noted, with excellent short-term results and minimal complication rates. Arthroscopic revision stabilization for failed stabilization procedures is increasingly being performed, although it is technically more challenging than the primary stabilization procedure because of the anatomic rearrangements of the index surgery. In this article, we describe a revision arthroscopic technique for anatomic glenoid reconstruction using iliac crest autograft for a previous failed AAGR procedure secondary to nonunion of the graft. The graft is passed through the Halifax far-medial portal without splitting the subscapularis. Arthroscopic revision in the setting of a failed AAGR procedure is technically easier than after a Latarjet procedure, as the anatomy is relatively undisturbed in the former, facilitating easier identification of anatomic landmarks, accurate graft positioning, and decreased risk of neurovascular injuries. A Bankart capsulolabral repair is performed after graft fixation, making the graft extra-articular and providing additional stability.

N2  - Background Dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint is one of the most common shoulder injuries in a sport-active population. The question of whether surgery should be used remains controversial. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical versus conservative (non-surgical) interventions for treating acromioclavicular dislocations in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to June 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1946 to June 2019), Embase (1980 to June 2019), and LILACS (1982 to June 2019), trial registries, and reference lists of articles. There were no restrictions based on language or publication status. Selection criteria We included all randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared surgical with conservative treatment of acromioclavicular dislocation in adults. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently performed study screening and selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction. We pooled data where appropriate and used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome. Main results We included five randomised trials and one quasi-randomised trial. The included trials involved 357 mainly young adults, the majority of whom were male, with acute acromioclavicular dislocation. The strength of the findings in all studies was limited due to design features, invariably lack of blinding, that carry a high risk of bias. Fixation of the acromioclavicular joint using hook plates, tunnelled suspension devices, coracoclavicular screws, acromioclavicular pins, or (usually threaded) wires was compared with supporting the arm in a sling or similar device. After surgery, the arm was also supported in a sling or similar device in all trials. Where described in the trials, both groups had exercise-based rehabilitation. We downgraded the evidence for all outcomes at least two levels, invariably for serious risk of bias and serious imprecision. Low-quality evidence from two studies showed no evidence of a difference between groups in shoulder function at one year, assessed using the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (DASH) (0 (best function) to 100 (worst function)): mean difference (MD) 0.73 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.70 to 4.16; 112 participants. These results were consistent with other measures of function at one-year or longer follow-up, including non-validated outcome scores reported by three studies. There is low-quality evidence that function at six weeks may be better after conservative treatment, indicating an earlier recovery. Very low-quality evidence from one trial found no difference between groups in participants reporting pain at one year: risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.19; 79 participants. There is very low-quality evidence that surgery may not reduce the risk of treatment failure, usually resulting in non-routine secondary surgery: 14/168 versus 15/174; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.94; 342 participants, 6 studies. The main source of treatment failure was complications related to surgical implants in the surgery group and persistent symptoms, mainly discomfort, due to the acromioclavicular dislocation in the conservatively treated group. There is low-quality evidence from two studies that there may be little or no difference between groups in the return to former activities (sports or work) at one year: 57/67 versus 62/70; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.10; 137 participants, 2 studies. Low-quality but consistent evidence from four studies indicated an earlier recovery in conservatively treated participants compared with those treated with surgery. There is low-quality evidence of no clinically important difference between groups at one year in quality of life scores, measured using the 36-item or 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36 or SF-12) (0-to-100 scale, where 100 is best score), in either the physical component (MD −0.63, 95% CI −2.63 to 1.37; 122 participants, 2 studies) or mental component (MD 0.47 points, 95% CI −1.51 to 2.44; 122 participants). There is very low-quality and clinically heterogenous evidence of a greater risk of an adverse event after surgery: 45/168 versus 16/174; RR 2.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 4.82; 342 participants, 6 studies; I2 = 48%. Common adverse outcomes were hardware complications or discomfort (18.5%) and infection (8.7%) in the surgery group and persistent symptoms (7.1%), mainly discomfort, in the conservatively treated group. The majority of surgical complications occurred in older studies testing now-outdated devices known for their high risk of complications. The very low-quality evidence from one study (70 participants) means that we are uncertain whether there is a between-group difference in patient dissatisfaction with cosmetic results. It is notable that the evidence for function, return to former activities, and quality of life came from the two most recently conducted studies, which tested currently used devices and interventions in clearly defined participant populations that represented the commonly perceived population for which there is uncertainty over the use of surgery. There were insufficient data to conduct subgroup analysis relating to type of injury and whether surgery involved ligament reconstruction or not. Authors' conclusions There is low-quality evidence that surgical treatment has no additional benefits in terms of function, return to former activities, and quality of life at one year compared with conservative treatment. There is, however, low-quality evidence that people treated conservatively had improved function at six weeks compared with surgical management. There is very low-quality evidence of little difference between the two treatments in pain at one year, treatment failure usually resulting in secondary surgery, or patient satisfaction with cosmetic result. Although surgery may result in more people sustaining adverse events, this varied between the trials, being more common in techniques such as K-wire fixation that are rarely used today. There remains a need to consider the balance of risks between the individual outcomes: for example, surgical adverse events, including wound infection or dehiscence and hardware complication, against risk of adverse events that may be more commonly associated with conservative treatment such as persistent symptoms or discomfort, or both. There is a need for sufficiently powered, good-quality, well-reported randomised trials of currently used surgical interventions versus conservative treatment for well-defined injuries.

N2  - Objectives: Deformation of the coracoacromial ligament during overhead movement has been linked to shoulder pathologies such as impingement and rotator cuff tear. We, therefore, explored this relationship in a group of elite adolescent badminton players. Method: We performed bilateral shoulder physical and ultrasonographic examination in 35 adolescent asymptomatic badminton players, 13 players with unilateral shoulder pain, and 15 non-athletes of similar age. Coracoacromial ligament deformation, defined as the maximal vertical distance between the ligament apex to a line connecting the acromion and coracoid process, was measured during shoulder abduction and internal rotation and compared within and between groups. Other ultrasonographic measurements and the incidence of shoulder pathologies were also evaluated. Result: Among badminton athletes who reported dominant shoulder pain, coracoacromial ligament deformation was significantly larger in their dominant shoulder than in their non-dominant shoulder (3.5 and 2.0 mm, respectively; p = 0.013); this difference was not present in other groups. Regardless of the presence or absence of pain, athletes displayed more coracoacromial ligament deformation and increased supraspinatus tendon thickness in their dominant shoulder than did the control group. Abnormal ultrasound findings were noted in all groups; however, the incidence was not significantly different. Conclusion: Increased coracoacromial ligament deformation during overhead movement is associated with shoulder pain in elite adolescent badminton players. Our findings may help clinicians identify athletes at risk of subacromial impingement syndrome.

N2  - Purpose: The reconstruction of oromandibular defects can be challenging, particularly when considerable amounts of bone and soft tissues are lost. In such cases, the use of a single flap may be unsatisfactory and a concomitant free flap is needed. Here we present a chimeric, thoracodorsal perforator-scapular free flap based on the angular artery of the subscapular system (TDAP-Scap-aa) as an alternative technique for single flap reconstruction of extensive oromandibular defects. Materials and methods: The authors studied patients who underwent reconstructions of extensive oromandibular defects with a TDAP-Scap-aa free flap. The operative technique and the clinical experiences are described. Postoperatively, surgical complications were classified with the Clavien-Dindo Classification. Results: Five male patients (59.4 ± 8.8 years) were treated with the TDAP-Scap-aa. Average sizes for harvested hard and soft tissue components, which are both included in the flap and completely independently from each other, were 10.4 ± 1.5 cm of bone length, 2.6 ± 0.3 cm of bone height, 11.6 ± 4.8 cm of skin paddle length and 8.4 ± 1.7 cm of skin paddle width. The overall mean operation time (cut-suture) was 14.6 ± 0.9 h. The postoperative follow-up was 6 months. No complications requiring surgical treatment as well as donor site nerve damages were observed. Conclusions: In comparison to other double free flaps, the TDAP-Scap-aa offers several advantages such as higher amounts of hard and soft tissues without prolonged operation times, and provides satisfying aesthetic outcomes and little donor site morbidity due to the preservation of muscle and nerve structures. Therefore, the TDAP-Scap-aa constitutes a clinically reliable alternative in extensive oromandibular defect reconstruction.

N2  - Background: The literature demonstrates a high prevalence of asymptomatic knee and hip findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in athletes. Baseball pitchers are shown to have a high prevalence of asymptomatic shoulder MRI findings, but the incidence of asymptomatic shoulder MRI findings has not been systematically evaluated in nonthrowing contact athletes. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of shoulder abnormalities in asymptomatic professional and collegiate hockey players. We hypothesized that, similar to overhead throwing athletes, ice hockey players will have a high prevalence of asymptomatic MRI findings, including labral, acromioclavicular (AC), and rotator cuff pathology on MRI. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 25 asymptomatic collegiate and professional hockey players (50 shoulders) with no history of missed games or practice because of shoulder injury, pain, or dysfunction underwent bilateral shoulder noncontrast 3.0-T MRI. MRIs were read blinded by 2 board-certified radiologists at 2 separate time points, 3 months apart, to determine the prevalence of abnormalities of the joint fluid, bone marrow, rotator cuff tendon, biceps tendon, labrum, AC joint, and glenohumeral joint. Interrater and intrareader reliability was determined, and regression analysis was performed to identify the prevalence and relationship to stick-hand dominance. Results: Labral abnormalities were seen in 25% of the shoulders. AC joint abnormalities and rotator cuff findings were noted in 8% and 6% of shoulders, respectively. One shoulder was noted to have a biceps tendon abnormality, and 1 shoulder demonstrated glenohumeral joint chondral findings. Interrater reliability coefficients were 0.619 for labral abnormalities. Intrareader reliability kappa coefficients were 0.493 and 0.718 for both readers, respectively, for labral abnormalities. Regression analysis was performed and revealed that the overall shoulder pathology was more common in the nondominant stick hand (top stick hand) (coefficient –0.731; P =.021). Conclusion: Professional and collegiate ice hockey players had an overall prevalence of labral abnormalities in 25% of their shoulders, with findings more often found in the nondominant stick hand. Rotator cuff abnormalities were uncommon in ice hockey players. These findings differ significantly from published reports examining professional baseball players and other overhead sports athletes.

N2  - PURPOSE: Glenoid bone integrity is crucial for shoulder stability. The purpose of this study was to investigate a non-invasive method for quantifying bone loss regarding reliability and accuracy to detect glenoid bone deficiency in standard two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) measurements at different time points. It was hypothesized that the diameter of the circle used would significantly differ between raters, rendering this method inaccurate and not allowing for an exact estimation of glenoid defect size. METHODS: Fifty-two shoulder CTs from 26 patients (26 2D-CTs; 26 3D-CTs) with anterior glenoid bone defects were evaluated by 6 raters at time 0 (T0) and at least 3 weeks after (T1) to assess the glenoid bone defect using the ratio method ("best fit circle"). Inter- and intra-rater differences concerning circle dimensions (circle diameter), measured width of bone loss and calculated percentage of bone loss (length-width-ratio) were compared in 2D- versus 3D-CT scans. The intraclass coefficient (ICC) was used to determine the inter- and intra-rater agreement. RESULTS: The mean circle diameter difference in 2D-CT was 2.0 ± 1.9 mm versus 1.8 ± 1.5 mm in 3D-CT, respectively (p < 0.01). Mean width of bone loss in 2D-CT was 1.9 ± 1.7 mm compared to 1.7 ± 1.5 mm in 3D-CT, respectively (p < 0.01). The mean difference of bone loss percentage was 5.1 ± 4.8% in 2D-CT and 4.8 ± 4.5% in 3D-CT (p < 0.01). No significant differences concerning circle diameter, bone loss width and bone loss percentage were detected comparing T0 and T1. Circle diameter, bone loss width and bone loss percentage measurements in 3D-CT were significantly smaller compared to 2D-CT at T0 and T1 (p < 0.01). Agreement (ICC) was fair to good for all indicators of circle diameter (range 0.76-0.83), bone loss width (range 0.76-0.86) and percentage of bone loss (range 0.85-0.91). Overall, 3D-CT showed superior agreement compared to 2D-CT. CONCLUSION: The ratio method varies in all glenoid parameters and is not valid for consistently quantifying glenoid bone defects even in 3D computed tomography. This must be taken into consideration when determining proper surgical treatment. The degree of glenoid bone loss alone should not be used to decide for or against a bony procedure. Rather, it is more important to define a defect size as "critical" and to also take other patient-specific factors into consideration so that the best treatment option can be undertaken. Application of the "best fitting circle" is a source of error when using the ratio method; therefore, care should be taken when measuring the circle diameter.III.

N2  - Background: Despite its various positive health effects, long-distance running implies substantial biomechanical loads on the musculoskeletal system, especially in a competitive context. The incidence of running-related overuse injuries is high, especially for the tibia being one of the predominant injury localisations. Tibial impact accelerations are an established valid proxy measure for impact forces and, as such, considered a more direct estimate of tibial bone load than ground reaction forces. Assessing individual tibial and upper-body impact accelerations may help balancing biomechanical loads during training for long-distance running and triathlon. Material and methods: We employed inexpensive, wireless, lightweight, triaxial inertial measurement units (IMUs) as wearables for measuring tibial, sacral and scapular impact loads and asymmetries in 45 healthy junior-elite long-distance runners at submaximal running speeds. Moreover, we investigated the effects of ground surface vs. running speed on tibial load in 8 well-trained, healthy runners and triathletes. Results: Mean peak tibial accelerations in junior elite long-distance runners ranged between 14 ± 3 and 16 ± 3 g (g ≈ 9.81 m s−1) for running speeds of 14–16 km h−1. Corresponding mean peak sacral and scapular accelerations amounted to 4 ± 1 g to 5 ± 1 g (32 ± 8% of tibial load) and 4 ± 1 g (27 ± 6%), respectively. Observed lateral asymmetries in tibial and scapular accelerations yielded mean absolute values of 9 ± 8% (95th percentile of 24%) and 9 ± 10% (32%). The effect of running speed on tibial accelerations was approximately twice as large as the effect of ground surface. Among asphalt, tartan, treadmill and turf, only turf induced a significantly lower tibial load in well-trained runners. Conclusions: IMU sensors represent a promising tool for assessing biomechanical loads and asymmetries in running under field conditions. With the orientation values derived in this study, they may be used to reduce individual risks of overuse injuries and, in future, possibly to assess running efficiency. Level of evidence: Ib.

N2  - Background: Minimal rotation of the scapula may affect the measurement of critical shoulder angle (CSA). We investigated the difference in the CSA measured in minimal rotation between the patients with rotator cuff tear and those without non-rotator cuff tear and the CSA measurement error by comparing with computed tomography (CT). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tear and whose X-ray views correspond to Suter-Henninger classification type A1 and C1. The CSA values between the normal control group (without rotator cuff tear) and the rotator cuff tear group were compared according to A1 type and C1 type. In the rotator cuff tear group, we compared the CSA values measured by using X-ray and CT. Results: A total of 238 patients (rotator cuff tear group, 139 patients; normal cuff group, 99 patients) were included in this study. The mean CSA of the rotator cuff tear group was 33.4° ± 3.5°, and that of the normal cuff group was 32.6° ± 3.9° (p = 0.085). On comparison of the CSA according to the Suter-Henninger classification type, the CSA values on the A1 type view and C1 type view were 32.7° ± 3.5° and 33.7° ± 3.5°, respectively, in the rotator cuff tear group and 30.5° ± 3.1° and 33.1 ± 3.9°, respectively, in the normal cuff group (p = 0.024 and p = 0.216, respectively). The mean CSA was 32.5° ± 3.1° in CT and 33.3° ± 3.2° in X-ray (p = 0.184). On comparison of the CSA according to the Suter-Henninger classification type, the CSA values on the A1 type view and C1 type view were 32.6° ± 3.6° and 32.5° ± 2.4°, respectively, in CT and 32.5° ± 3.5° and 34.2° ± 2.6°, respectively, in X-ray (p = 0.905 and p = 0.017, respectively). Conclusions: The X-ray view corresponding to Suter-Henninger classification type A1 or CT-reconstructed image can be used to reduce the measurement error and obtain reliable CSA values. The CSA measured on the X-ray view corresponding to Suter-Henninger classification type A1 may be related with rotator cuff tear.

N2  - Background:Throwing requires proper stability and orientation of the pelvis and scapula for efficient energy transfer during pitching. Fatigue of the pelvis and scapular musculature throughout the course of a game can impair pitching performance, and place excessive demands on the throwing arm leading to injury. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in pelvis, torso, and upper extremity pitching mechanics and muscle activations between the fastball, change-up, and curveball pitches in youth baseball pitchers following a simulated game.Methods:Fourteen youth baseball pitchers with no history of injury participated. Pitching mechanics were collected using an electromagnetic tracking system. Surface electromyography data were collected on the bilateral gluteus medius and maximus; and throwing arm side latissimus dorsi, lower trapezius, upper trapezius, and serratus anterior. Participants were instructed to throw maximum effort pitches during a simulated game that provided random game situations similar to those that occur in competition. Participants were limited to 85 pitches based on age-restricted pitch counts. Data from 3 fastballs, curveballs, and change-ups thrown in the first and last innings were selected for analysis.Results:Repeated measures multivariate analyses of variance revealed that neither pitch type nor the effect of a simulated game resulted in statistically significant changes in pitching mechanics (F(10,600)=0.55, P=0.85), or muscle activations (pelvic: F(4,195)=0.07, P=0.85; scapular: F(4,118)=0.09, P=0.52).Conclusions:The principle findings of this study revealed that pitching to the age-restricted pitch count limit did not result in altered pitching mechanics or muscle activations, and no differences occurred between the 3 pitches. These results support previous research that indicate the curveball pitch is no more dangerous for youth than the other pitches commonly thrown. This is supported by the pitcher's ability to maintain a proper arm slot during all 3 pitches and indicates that they are obtaining the spin on the ball from their grip and not by altering upper extremity mechanics.Level of Evidence:Level 5.

N2  - Background: Glenohumeral idiopathic adhesive capsulitis is a common shoulder condition that hinders functionality. Addressing the pathology has been extensively researched. Ultrasound (US)-guided injections have shown their efficacy. However, no study has been conducted to compare anatomical accuracy between different approaches in targeting the coracohumeral ligament (CHL). Objective: To investigate whether US-guided injection of the CHL can be performed accurately using either the rotator interval (RI) or the coracoidal (CO) approach. Methods: An experimental cadaveric case series. Setting: Anatomy laboratory. Specimens: Both shoulders of 13 Thiel-embalmed cadavers. Interventions: Three physiatrists each injected a 0.1 mL bolus of colored dye in both shoulders of each cadaver using either the RI or the CO approach under US guidance. Each cadaver received a total of six injections (three injections per shoulder). The accuracy of the injection was determined following shoulder dissection by an anatomist. Main Outcome Measure: The accuracy of the US-guided injection of the CHL. Results: The RI approach yielded 36 accurate injections, giving it an accuracy of 100%. With the CO approach two injections were deemed inaccurate yielding an accuracy of 94%. There was no significant difference in accuracy between all operators. Conclusions: US-guided injection of the CHL can be performed accurately with both the RI and CO approaches. The RI approach was likely to be more accurate.

N2  - CONTEXT: Several studies have shown that the kinematics of the scapula is altered in many disorders that affect the shoulder. Description of scapular motion in the chest continues to be a scientific and clinical challenge. OBJECTIVE: To check the validity and reliability of a new, minimally invasive method of tracking the internal and external rotation of the scapula using ultrasound imaging combined with the signal provided by a 3-dimensional electromagnetic sensor. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study with a repeated-measures descriptive test-retest design was employed to evaluate this new tracking method. The new method was validated in vitro and the reliability of data over repeated measures between scapula positions was calculated in vivo. SETTING: University laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 30 healthy men and women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The validation of the scapula rotation tracking using the in vitro model was calculated by Pearson correlation test between a 2-dimensional cross-correlation algorithm of the new method and another software image. The reliability of the tracking of the scapula rotation was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: In the validation in vitro, the correlation of rotations obtained by the 2 methods was good (r = .77, P = .01). The reliability in vivo had excellent results (intraclass correlation coefficient = .88; 95% confidence interval, .82-.93) in the test-retest analysis of 8 measures. The intrarater analysis of variance test showed no significant differences between the measures (P = .85, F = 0.46). CONCLUSION: Ultrasound imaging combined with a motion sensor to track the scapula has been shown to be a reliable and valid method for measuring internal and external rotation during separation of the upper limb.

N2  - Background: It is important to monitor progress during rehabilitation of stroke patients. To that end, clinical function tests may be supported by three-dimensional kinematic measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inter- and intra-rater reliability of three-dimensional kinematic measures of shoulder movements in stroke patients with reduced shoulder function. Methods: Seventeen patients were tested in three sessions by two trained raters. Three-dimensional motion capture was performed of the more affected upper extremity and the trunk. Measures of movements of the scapula and humerus related to the trunk, the trunk related to the laboratory, the forearm related to the humerus, and temporospatial measures were obtained during two reach tasks from the Wolf Motor Function Test, ReachLow and ReachHigh. Inter- and intra-rater reliability was quantified with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Findings: In general, range of movements of scapula, shoulder, trunk and elbow and movement time and reach length showed high inter-rater reliability (ICC∞ 0.84–0.98) and intra-rater reliability (ICC∞ 0.75–1.00), A minimum of five trials per task were required to achieve reliable ICC estimates. Interpretation: Selected three-dimensional kinematic measures can be used reliably to evaluate specific movements of the shoulder in stroke patients with reduced shoulder function.

N2  - Background: Pain and functional impairment of the ipsilateral shoulder girdle in patients who underwent surgery and radiotherapy for breast cancer (BC) is a late complication reported in the literature. We analyze a correlation with dosimetric parameters and propose an algorithm for sparing strategies. Methods: A total of 111 patients treated for BC were included in this observational analysis during follow-up protocol visits. Exclusion criteria were the presence of moderate or severe arthrosis history and/or rheumatologic diseases. All the patients had complete physical and multidimensional examinations during joint (physiatrist and radiotherapy oncology) follow-up visits. A scapula–humeral articulation (SHA) standardized contouring was performed retrospectively on Eclipse® treatment plans. A possible correlation between patients’ characteristics, radiotherapy, and dosimetry analysis and functional impairment was investigated at statistical analysis. Results of analysis were summarized into a proposal of algorithm for sparing SHA. Results: A total of 111 patients were selected during follow-up visits. Mean age of patients was 60 years (range 41–85 years). A total of 103 patients (93%) underwent conservative surgery, with 110 patients (99%) undergoing axilla surgery as well. Fifty-two patients (46.8%) presented a reduction of range of motion (ROM) abduction on the treated side at the observational analysis. Mean ROM abduction reduction was 13°06’ (range 0°–100°). Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH) score results were excellent in 79 patients (71.2%), discrete in 15 patients (13.5%), good in 15 patients (13.5%), and sufficient in 2 patients (1.8%). Median EQD2 Dmax at SHA was 18 Gy (range 0.22–51.9 Gy) and median EQD2 mean dose at SHA was 2 Gy (range 0.04–24.32 Gy). Univariate analysis showed a linear correlation between DASH score and ROM of abduction of treated side (ρ=−0.7), ROM of abduction and ROM of flexion in ipsilateral arm (ρ=0.8), or ROM of abduction and ROM of flexion in contralateral arm (ρ=0.8). A statistically significant difference in ROM abduction between the 2 arms was found at χ2 test (P<0.05 at χ2 confidence interval = 95%). Cox linear regression analysis showed ROM abduction on treated arm as a predictive factor of DASH score (P<0.0001). Age (P<0.05), DASH score (P=0.006), and ROM abduction on treated arm (P=0.005) were found as independent predictive factors of mean dose at multivariate analysis. A mean dose higher than 7 Gy and ROM abduction reduction more than 30° were related to DASH score level reduction. Conclusions: This hypothesis-generating study introduces an algorithm to be validated for management of sparing SHA and improving quality of survivorship. ROM evaluation after surgery, early physiotherapy, standard contouring, and planning adaptation represent possible indications to preserve shoulder impairment. Further prospective studies are needed to discriminate impairment of surgery and radiotherapy in order to personalized therapeutic plan programs.

N2  - Clinical Scenario: Assessing movement of the scapula is an important component in the evaluation and treatment of the shoulder complex. Currently, gold-standard methods to quantify scapular movement include invasive technique, radiation, and 3D motion systems. This critically appraised topic focuses on several clinical assessment methods of quantifying scapular upward rotation with respect to their reliability and clinical utility. Clinical Question: Is there evidence for noninvasive methods that reliably assess clinical measures of scapular upward rotation in subjects with or without shoulder pathologies? Summary of Key Findings: Four studies were selected to be critically appraised. The quality appraisal of diagnostic reliability checklist was used to score the articles on methodology and consistency. Three of the 4 studies demonstrated support for the clinical question. Clinical Bottom Line: There is moderate evidence to support reliable clinical methods for measuring scapular upward rotation in subjects with or without shoulder pathology. Strength of Recommendation: There is moderate evidence to suggest there are reliable clinical measures to quantify scapular upward rotation in patients with or without shoulder pathology.

N2  - Anterior glenohumeral instability with >20% glenoid bone loss is a disorder that can be treated with the Latarjet stabilizing procedure; however, complications are common. The purposes of this study were to (1) evaluate the effect of an anatomic-specific titanium implant produced by 3-dimensional (3D) printing as a treatment option for recurrent shoulder instability with substantial glenoid bone loss and (2) compare the use of that implant with the Latarjet procedure.Methods:Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders (mean age at the time of death, 78 years) were tested in a biomechanical setup with the humerus in 30° of abduction and in neutral rotation. The shoulders were tested under 5 different conditions: (1) normal situation, (2) creation of an anterior glenoid defect, (3) implantation of an anatomic-specific titanium implant produced by 3D printing, and the Latarjet procedure (4) with and (5) without 10 N of load attached to the conjoined tendon. In each condition, the humerus was translated 10 mm anteriorly relative to the glenoid, and the maximum peak translational force that was necessary for this translation was measured.Results:After creation of the glenoid defect, the mean translational peak force decreased by 30% ± 6% compared with that for the normal shoulder. After restoration of the original glenoid anatomy, the translational force needed to dislocate the humeral head from the glenoid significantly increased compared with that in the defect condition - to 119% ± 16% of normal (p < 0.01) with the 3D-printed anatomic-specific implant and to 121% ± 48% of normal (p < 0.01) following the Latarjet procedure. No significant differences in mean translational force were found between the anatomic-specific implant and the Latarjet procedure (p = 0.72).Conclusions:The mean translational peak force needed to dislocate the humerus 10 mm anteriorly on the glenoid was higher after glenoid restoration with the 3D-printed anatomic-specific implant compared with when the glenoid had a 20% surface defect but also compared with when the glenoid was intact. No differences in mean translational peak force were found between the 3D-printed anatomic-specific glenoid implant and the Latarjet procedure, although there was less variability in the 3D-implant condition.Clinical Relevance:Novel 3D-printing technology could provide a reliable patient-specific alternative to solve problems related to traditional treatment methods for shoulder instability.

N2  - Purpose: Altered three-dimensional (3D) joint kinematics can contribute to shoulder pathology, including post-stroke shoulder pain. Reliable assessment methods enable comparative studies between asymptomatic shoulders of healthy subjects and painful shoulders of post-stroke subjects, and could inform treatment planning for post-stroke shoulder pain. The study purpose was to establish intra-rater test-retest reliability and within-subject repeatability of a palpation/digitization protocol, which assesses 3D clavicular/scapular/humeral rotations, in asymptomatic and painful post-stroke shoulders. Methods: Repeated measurements of 3D clavicular/scapular/humeral joint/segment rotations were obtained using palpation/digitization in 32 asymptomatic and six painful post-stroke shoulders during four reaching postures (rest/flexion/abduction/external rotation). Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs), standard error of the measurement and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: All ICC values indicated high to very high test-retest reliability (≥0.70), with lower reliability for scapular anterior/posterior tilt during external rotation in asymptomatic subjects, and scapular medial/lateral rotation, humeral horizontal abduction/adduction and axial rotation during abduction in post-stroke subjects. All standard error of measurement values demonstrated within-subject repeatability error ≤5° for all clavicular/scapular/humeral joint/segment rotations (asymptomatic ≤3.75°; post-stroke ≤5.0°), except for humeral axial rotation (asymptomatic ≤5°; post-stroke ≤15°). Conclusions: This noninvasive, clinically feasible palpation/digitization protocol was reliable and repeatable in asymptomatic shoulders, and in a smaller sample of painful post-stroke shoulders. Implications for Rehabilitation In the clinical setting, a reliable and repeatable noninvasive method for assessment of three-dimensional (3D) clavicular/scapular/humeral joint orientation and range of motion (ROM) is currently required. The established reliability and repeatability of this proposed palpation/digitization protocol will enable comparative 3D ROM studies between asymptomatic and post-stroke shoulders, which will further inform treatment planning. Intra-rater test-retest repeatability, which is measured by the standard error of the measure, indicates the range of error associated with a single test measure. Therefore, clinicians can use the standard error of the measure to determine the "true" differences between pre-treatment and post-treatment test scores.

N2  - Patient-specific biomechanical simulations of joints require accurate reconstruction of bony anatomy from medical image data. The articular geometries of the joints may influence their biomechanics. Statistical shape models (SSMs) have become ubiquitous in the literature and aim to capture the natural variation of biological objects. They work by learning the variation from training examples to define the space of valid biological shapes. However, the kinematic information descriptive of the anato-physiological relationship of two interacting objects is not generally encoded in the SSM. Here, we propose a framework for developing combined statistical shape and kinematics models (SSKMs) as Gaussian process morphable models to analyse the shape and kinematics relationship. We demonstrate the framework on a three-dimensional (3D) image data set consisting of ten right-handed cadaveric shoulder joints acquired using computed tomography. Additionally, we simulate specific bone motions to encode kinematics in the combined model. Our SSKM built from shoulder data (matching scapulae and humeri) correctly depicts a correlation between the shape and kinematics as hypothesized. We furthermore demonstrate the ability to marginalize from the SSKM to obtain shape-only variation and kinematics-only variation. Future work aims to use the SSKM framework to understand the relationships between kinematics and shape for various joints as well as to develop patient-specific computational models to evaluate joint biomechanics.

N2  - Purpose: Greater tuberosity fractures are challenging lesions concerning decision-making. In order to improve our treatment algorithm, we developed a new method, which allows predicting a possible subacromial conflict on standard anteroposterior radiographs, considering not only the displacement of the fragment but also the width of the subacromial space. Methods: The measurement technique consisted of drawing three concentric circles on true anteroposterior radiographs. The inner circle (radius Rh) perfectly matched the humeral head surface. The medial circle (radius Rt) was tangent to the greater tuberosity, and the outer circle (radius Ra) touched the undersurface of the acromion. The ratio Rt/Rh, which describes how much the greater tuberosity projects above the articular surface, and the relationship (Rt-Rh)/(Ra-Rh), which quantifies the space occupied by the greater tuberosity under the acromion, were calculated and called Greater Tuberosity Index and Impingement Index, respectively. Five dry humeri were used to assess the influence of rotation and abduction on the Greater Tuberosity Index. The radiographs of 80 shoulders without any osseous pathology were analyzed to obtain reference values for both indices. Finally, greater tuberosity fractures with different displacements were created in five cadaver specimens, and subacromial impingement was correlated with these parameters. Results: On anteroposterior radiographs, the greater tuberosity was most prominent in neutral rotation, regardless of abduction. In shoulders without osseous pathology, the Greater Tuberosity Index and the Impingement Index averaged 1.15 (range 1.06–1.28) and 0.46 (range 0.21–0.67). In the biomechanical experiments, the Impingement Index was a better discriminator for subacromial impingement than the Greater Tuberosity Index. A fracture with a displacement corresponding to an Impingement Index of 0.71 or greater was associated with subacromial impingement. Conclusions: Reduction of a displaced greater tuberosity fragment should be considered if the Impingement Index is 0.7 or greater. The measurement method is simple and reliable and has the potential to be used for the assessment of subacromial impingement in other conditions.

N2  - The ideal technique for the treatment of anterior shoulder instability with glenoid bone loss is a topic of debate. Several techniques have been described by the orthopaedic surgeons including bony reconstruction as well as soft tissue repair. The clinical outcomes and complication rate (recurrent instability and graft failure) of these procedures vary significantly. It is believed that arthroscopic anatomic bony reconstruction might be a suitable option for the treatment of anterior shoulder instability with significant glenoid bone loss. We have discussed the technique of arthroscopic anatomic glenoid reconstruction using distal tibial allograft preserving the subscapularis muscle which seems to be very safe with excellent outcome.

N2  - OJECTIVE Clinical consequences of ectopic tendons of the pectoralis minor muscle (PMM) for shoulder pain and range-of-motion limitation have been demonstrated. For better understanding the existence of such ectopic tendons, a phylogenetic hypothesis is proposed. METHODS Forty-five shoulders of anatomical specimens were dissected and examined. Insertions areas of PMM were measured and occurring aberrant tendons were identified. Their relationship with the coracohumeral ligament (CHL) described and samples of the ligament were collected and histologically stained. RESULTS The prevalence of PMM variations was 37.84%. Shoulders with variations showed a statistically significant smaller coracopectoral distance (p<0.001) and larger insertion areas (p<0.003) than shoulders without. A strong negative correlation between these two variables (p<0.001, r = -0.620) was shown. CONCLUSIONS The presented results prompted the conclusion that the CHL may be in fact the remnant of the pectoralis minor tendon (PMT), which migrated from the humerus to the coracoid process through the process of phylogenetic evolution. Variations of PMTs are significantly more common than in previous studies. Imaging techniques appear to be insufficiently sensitive for reliably detecting ectopic tendons. Especially in patients experiencing shoulder pain and stiffness in whom the commoner pathologies have been ruled out the possibility of ectopic PMT should be kept in mind and ruled out.

N2  - The use of a synthetic polytetrafluoroethylene patch to repair large rotator cuff tears has resulted in good postoperative outcomes with respect to strength and range of motion. However, there is little information evaluating the movement patterns of the shoulder after patch repair. Following a reliability study of radiography to assess shoulder joint angles, radiographic assessment of shoulder kinematics was performed at 68±52 weeks (mean±SEM) postoperatively. This study compared the outcomes of polytetrafluoroethylene patch repair (n=15), suture-anchor repair (n=8), reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (n=7), and normal shoulders (n=5). The inter-rater and intrarater reliability of radiography was excellent (r=0.98, 0.96). Glenohumeral joint movement at maximal active abduction following patch repair (59±5 degrees), suture-anchor repair (57±8 degrees) and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (52±7 degrees) was less than asymptomatic shoulders (95±3 degrees; P<0.01). Scapulothoracic motion remained similar between all cohorts. The present study demonstrated that the abnormal relationship between glenohumeral and scapulothoracic motion post rotator cuff repair is due to a decrease in glenohumeral joint movement, rather than a compensatory increase in scapulothoracic motion.

N2  - Successful anatomic and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty require a detailed understanding of each individual patient's pathology. Advances in preoperative imaging continue to give surgeons a greater ability to customize implants to recreate native anatomy. Technological advancements have attempted to harness this information in the form of patient-specific instrumentation and more recently computed tomography-guided navigation. However, goals of shoulder arthroplasty remain the same: precise implant placement in order to maximize glenohumeral range of motion and stability while minimizing impingement to increase implant longevity. This manuscript reviews current literature with regard to importance of anatomic restoration of the glenohumeral joint and how computed tomography-guided navigation can be applied to improve accuracy and reproducibility in total shoulder arthroplasty.

N2  - A thorough physical examination of the shoulder and cervical spine is critical in establishing a focused differential diagnosis of the pathology in and around the shoulder joint. Numerous tests have been described in the literature to help improve the diagnostic accuracy of specific shoulder or cervical spine pathology. A comprehensive approach for the physical examination of the cervical spine, scapula, and rotator cuff is presented and descriptions on how the tests are performed and the evidence behind why specific tests are used in enabling improved diagnosis of shoulder pathology are discussed.

N2  - We present a volumetric and extensive finite element model of the shoulder usable in the context of inverse control, in which the scapula is left unconstrained on the ribcage. Such a model allows for exploring various shoulder movements, which are essential for making patient-specific decisions. The proposed model consists of 23 volumetric muscles parts modelled using the finite element method. The glenohumeral, acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joints are modelled with soft ball-socket constraints. The musculoskeletal model can be controlled by a tracking-based algorithm, finding the excitations values in the muscles needed to follow some target points. The moment arms obtained during abduction and rotation are compared with the literature, which includes results from cadaveric data and a fine FE model of the rotator cuff and the deltoid. We simulated the paralysis of serratus anterior, a main reason of scapular winging, and compared it with its physiological counterpart. A deficiency in the range of motion as well as a reduction in upward rotation were observed, which both corroborate clinical observations. This is one of the most comprehensive model of the shoulder, which can be used to study complex pathologies of the shoulder and their impact on functional outcome such as range-of-motion.

N2  - Introduction: This paper describes a novel technique developed by the senior author to address acute acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) dislocations and certain distal clavicle fractures. Methods: The procedure employs a four strand, single tunnel, double endobutton repair performed entirely percutaneously, without any arthroscopic guidance or deep surgical dissection. Results: We present the preliminary results from our series of 6 consecutive patients performed over a period of 18 months. The mean length of surgery was 36min (range 32–40) and the mean correction of coracoclavicular (CC) distance achieved was 12.6 mm (range 10.3–14.1). There was no restriction of movement in any of the patients post-operatively and their average QuickDASH scores at final follow-up was 4.2 (range 0–6.8). Conclusion: Results in the present series were at least comparable to those for other techniques, validating percutaneous treatment as a solution for acute ACJ dislocations.

Design: We included 30 patients diagnosed with HSP. Patients were divided into three groups: IAI, SSNB, and combination treatment. Patients were assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) prior to the injection and at hour 1, week 2, and month 2 after the injection, with goniometry at two angles at the moment that pain started and maximum passive range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder and Modified Barthel Index prior to the injection, at week 2 and month 2 after the injection. Results: Significant decrease in the VAS and increase in shoulder passive ROMs were detected at all follow-ups in groups. In comparison, there was no significant difference in VAS scores. Change in the internal rotation at the moment that pain started was found to be higher in the patients treated with the combined method than the other methods. Change in maximum passive ROMs was similar between treatment groups. Conclusion: IAI, SSNB, and the combination treatments are reliable and effective treatment modalities that provide pain relief and an increase in shoulder passive ROMs in HSP.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Handheld dynamometers (HHD) provide quick and low-cost assessments of muscle strength and their use has been increasing in clinical practice. There is no available data related to the validity of HHD for this measurement. OBJECTIVE: To verify the concurrent validity of scapular protraction measurements using an HHD. METHODS: Individuals with traumatic anterior glenohumeral instability were allocated in Instability Group (n=20), healthy swimmers were allocated in Athletes Group (n=19) and healthy subjects were allocated in Sedentary Group (n=21). Concurrent validity was verified by the Pearson correlation test between HHD and isokinetic measurements. The agreement between instruments was verified by Bland-Altman plots, for each of the two HHD positions. RESULTS: A moderate correlation was observed between seated (r=0.59) and lying supine HHD (r=0.54) and isokinetic dynamometer measurements for the all groups. Separated group analysis exhibited a strong correlation between seated HHD and isokinetic dynamometer measurements in the Instability Group (r=0.80), Sedentary Group (r=0.79) and Athletes Group (r=0.76). The Bland-Altman plot showed greater agreement in the seated position than the lying supine position when comparing measurements with the HHD and isokinetic in both the general sample and separated groups. CONCLUSION: The HHD may be considered a valid tool for assessing scapular protraction muscle strength among healthy athletes, non-athletes and subjects with shoulder instability. We recommend to assess subjects in the seated position and to be aware that the HHD tends to overestimate the peak force, compared with the gold-standard isokinetic dynamometer.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate the diagnostic validity of the Kerlan-Jobe orthopedic clinic shoulder and elbow score (KJOC) and the Closed kinetic upper extremity stability test (CKCUEST) to assess functional impairments associated with shoulder injury in overhead female athletic populations. Design: Cross-sectional design. Methods: Thirty-four synchronized swimming and team handball female athletes completed the KJOC and the CKCUEST during their respective team selection trials. Unsupervised learning using k-means algorithm was used on collected data to perform group clustering and classify athletes as Injured or Not Injured. Odds ratios, likelihood ratios, sensitivity and specificity were computed based on the self-reported presence of shoulder injury at the time of testing or during the previous year. Results: Seven of the 34 athletes were injured or had suffered a time-loss injury in the previous year, representing a 20.5% prevalence rate. Clustering method using KJOC data resulted in a sensitivity of 86%, a specificity of 100% and a 229.67 diagnostic odds ratio. Clustering method using CKCUEST data resulted in a sensitivity of 86%, a specificity of 37% and a 3.53 diagnostic odds ratio. Conclusions: KJOC had good diagnostic validity to assess shoulder function and differentiate between injured and non-injured elite synchronized swimming and team handball female athletes. The CKCUEST seemed to be a poor screening test but may be an interesting test to evaluate functional upper extremity strength and plyometric capacity. Unsupervised learning methods allow to make decisions based on numerous variables which is an advantage when considering the usually substantial overlap in screening test scores between high- and low-risk athletes.

N2  - The goal of this study was to develop and validate a non-invasive approach to estimate scapular kinematics in individual patients. We hypothesized that machine learning algorithms could be developed using motion capture data to accurately estimate dynamic scapula orientation based on measured humeral orientations and acromion process positions. The accuracy of the algorithms was evaluated against a gold standard of biplane fluoroscopy using a 2D to 3D fluoroscopy/model matching process. Individualized neural networks were developed for nine healthy adult shoulders. These models were used to predict scapulothoracic kinematics, and the predicted kinematics were compared to kinematics obtained using biplane fluoroscopy to determine the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. Results showed correlations between predicted kinematics and validation kinematics. Estimated kinematics were within 10 of validation kinematics. We concluded that individualized machine learning algorithms show promise for providing accurate, non-invasive measurements of scapulothoracic kinematics.

N2  - BACKGROUND:: The glenoid track concept has been widely used to assess the risk of instability caused by a bipolar lesion. The mean glenoid track width is reported to be 83% of the glenoid width. However, this width seems to be affected by the range of motion of the shoulder. By clarifying the relationship between the range of shoulder motion and the glenoid track width, a more precise determination of the glenoid track width for each individual could be possible. PURPOSE:: To determine the relationship between the glenoid track width and the range of motion of healthy volunteers. STUDY DESIGN:: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS:: Magnetic resonance imaging was taken in 41 shoulders of 21 healthy volunteers (mean age, 32 years) with the arm in maximum horizontal extension, with the arm kept in 90° of abduction and 90° of external rotation. Three-dimensional surface bone models of the glenoid and the humerus were created with image analysis software. The distance from the anterior rim of the glenoid to the medial margin of the footprint of the rotator cuff tendon was defined as the glenoid track width. Active and passive ranges of shoulder motion were measured in the supine and sitting positions. The correlations between the glenoid track width and the ranges of shoulder motion were investigated with Pearson correlation coefficients. Intra- and interobserver reliabilities based on the intraclass correlation coefficient were also analyzed to assess the reliability of the glenoid track measurement. RESULTS:: The intra- and interobserver reliabilities for the glenoid track measurement were excellent (0.988 and 0.988, respectively). Among all the measurements, the glenoid track width and the active range of motion in horizontal extension in the sitting position showed the greatest correlation coefficient ( r = -0.623, P < .0001). A correlation between the glenoid track width and this angle was expressed as Y = -0.49 X + 90, where X is the horizontal extension angle (degrees) and Y is the glenoid track width (percentage of glenoid width). CONCLUSION:: The present data demonstrate that the greater the horizontal extension angle in abduction and external rotation, the smaller the glenoid track width. An individualized glenoid track width can be obtained by measuring the active horizontal extension angle with the arm in abduction and external rotation in the sitting position. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:: An individualized glenoid track width enables selection of a more precise surgical option by the on-track/off-track concept.

N2  - This study aimed to evaluate test and retest reliability according to examiner experience with the three-dimensional kinematics of the trunk, scapula, and arm segments during flexion and unilateral abduction of the arm. Ten men and 10 women (mean age, 25.1 [1.1] years) participated in this study. Each volunteer participated in six test sessions, four on the first day (two for each examiner) and two on the second day (one for each examiner). A 48-h interval was given between test days. The assessments were made by one examiner with movement analysis experience and a second examiner without experience. For each session (intra-day), the volunteers performed five repetitions of unilateral arm flexions and abductions using their dominant arms. After 1 h, the data were re-collected and all markers were replaced. Data from the trunk, scapula, and arm were analysed at 30° 60° 90° and 120° of arm flexion and abduction using intraclass coefficient correlation, standard error of the measurement, and analysis of variance. The results did not differ between the experienced and inexperienced examiners except for trunk axial rotation at all studied angles and for arm rotation at 120° of abduction. The examiner previously trained in movement analysis marker placement demonstrated the same intra-tester reliability as the inexperienced tester when marker placement accuracy was the variable of interest.

N2  - The conventional acromion marker cluster (AMC) method used to estimate scapular orientation cannot adequately represent complex shoulder movements due to soft tissue artifacts. The regression method may have nonlinear error changes depending on humeral elevation angle and elevation plane. Therefore, we aimed to develop a new method of estimating scapular orientation using curved surface interpolation during various shoulder movements, and to compare its accuracy with conventional and regression methods. Thirteen healthy men were recruited. AMC and refractive markers for bony landmarks were placed on the skin. During the preprocess, several shoulder postures, including different arm elevations and elevation planes, were measured using the motion capture system. Premeasured data were used to calibrate the positional relationship between AMC and scapula using curved surface interpolation. Subsequently, scapular orientations were estimated by measuring AMC and body markers of any shoulder posture. To evaluate the accuracy of our methods, 25 elevation postures and six tasks involving postures common to activities of daily living were applied. For tasks requiring greater arm elevation angles, the root mean square error was less in our method than in the conventional and regression methods. Therefore, our method could improve the accuracy of estimating scapular orientation in various elevation postures.

N2  - Background: It is important to quantify a static posture to evaluate the need for and effectiveness of interventions such as physical management, physiotherapy, spinal orthosis or surgical treatment on the alignment of body segments. Motion analysis systems can be used for this purpose, but they are expensive, require a high degree of technical experience and are not easily accessible. A simpler method is needed to quantify static posture. Research objective: Assess validity and inter and intra rater reliability using an iPad with a 3-D camera to evaluate posture and postural deformity. Method: A 3-D model of a lying posture, created using an iPad with a 3-D camera, was compared to a Qualisys motion analysis system of the same lying posture, the latter used as the gold standard. Markers on the trunk and the leg were captured by both systems, and results from distance and angle measurements were compared. Results: All intra-class correlation coefficient values were above 0.98, the highest systematic error was 4.3 mm for length measurements and 0.2° for angle measurements. Significance: A 3-D model of a person, with markers on anatomical landmarks, created with an iPad with a 3-D camera, is a valid and reliable method of quantifying static posture. Conclusion: An iPad with a 3-D camera is a relatively inexpensive, valid and reliable method to quantify static posture in a clinical environment.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the reliability of clinical measures related to forward shoulder posture (pectoralis minor index [PMI], scapular index [SI], abduction index [AI], acromion to the wall index [AWI]acromion to the treatment table index [ATI], and thoracic curvature [TC]), and to investigate the association (redundancy)among these measures. Methods: Twenty-one asymptomatic participants participated in this study. Two physiotherapists were trained to perform the clinical measurements. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC2,k)were calculated to assess intra- and interrater reliabilities. Pearson product moment correlation was used to investigate the existence of possible redundancy between the measures that showed high intra- and interrater reliabilities. Results: The measures showed ICCs between 0.30 and 0.97. Five measures, PMI, SI, AWI, ATI, and TC, showed appropriate values for intrarater reliability (ICCs 0.77-0.94), and 3 measures, AWI, ATI, and TC, for interrater reliability (ICCs 0.82-0.85). Among measures that showed acceptable intra- and interrater reliability values, 2 measures were redundant, showing high association (AWI vs ATI)(r = 0.80, P <.001). Conclusion: For PMI, SI, AWI, ATI, and TC measures, adequate values of intrarater reliability were observed. For AWI, ATI, and TC, adequate values of interrater reliability were found. Two pairs of measures were highly associated (PMI with SI; AWI with ATI), which indicates redundancy among them. Our results suggest that, when the same examiner performs the assessment, the combined use of the PMI, AWI, and TC measures allows a quick but comprehensive evaluation of the presence of forward shoulder posture.

N2  - Background: Impairments in dexterity after stroke are commonly assessed by the Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT), where the only outcome variable is the time taken to complete the test. We aimed to kinematically quantify and to compare the motor performance of the NHPT in persons post-stroke and controls (discriminant validity), to compare kinematics to clinical assessments of upper extremity function (convergent validity), and to establish the within-session reliability. Methods: The NHPT was modified and standardized (S-NHPT) by 1) replacing the original peg container with an additional identical nine hole pegboard, 2) adding a specific order of which peg to pick, and 3) specifying to insert the peg taken from the original pegboard into the corresponding hole of the target pegboard. Eight optical cameras registered upper body kinematics of 30 persons post-stroke and 41 controls during the S-NHPT. Four sequential phases of the task were identified and analyzed for kinematic group differences. Clinical assessments were performed. Results: The stroke group performed the S-NHPT slower (total movement time; mean diff 9.8 s, SE diff 1.4), less smoothly (number of movement units; mean diff 0.4, SE diff 0.1) and less efficiently (path ratio; mean diff 0.05, SE diff 0.02), and used increased scapular/trunk movements (acromion displacement; mean diff 15.7 mm, SE diff 3.5) than controls (P < 0.000, r ≥ 0.32), indicating discriminant validity. The stroke group also spent a significantly longer time grasping and releasing pegs relative to the transfer phases of the task compared to controls. Within the stroke group, kinematics correlated with time to complete the S-NHPT and the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (rs 0.38-0.70), suggesting convergent validity. Within-session reliability for the S-NHPT was generally high to very high for both groups (ICCs 0.71-0.94). Conclusions: The S-NHPT shows adequate discriminant validity, convergent validity and within-session reliability. Standardization of the test facilitates kinematic analysis of movement performance, which in turn enables identification of differences in movement control between persons post-stroke and controls that may otherwise not be captured through the traditional time-based NHPT. Future research should ascertain further psychometric properties, e.g. sensitivity, of the S-NHPT.

N2  - Biplane 2D-3D registration approaches have been used for measuring 3D, in vivo glenohumeral (GH) joint kinematics. Computed tomography (CT) has become the gold standard for reconstructing 3D bone models, as it provides high geometric accuracy and similar tissue contrast to video-radiography. Alternatively, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would not expose subjects to radiation and provides the ability to add cartilage and other soft tissues to the models. However, the accuracy of MRI-based 2D-3D registration for quantifying glenohumeral kinematics is unknown. We developed an automatic 2D-3D registration program that works with both CT- and MRI-based image volumes for quantifying joint motions. The purpose of this study was to use the proposed 2D-3D auto-registration algorithm to describe the humerus and scapula tracking accuracy of CT- and MRI-based registration relative to radiostereometric analysis (RSA) during dynamic biplanar video-radiography. The GH kinematic accuracy (RMS error) was 0.6–1.0 mm and 0.6–2.2° for the CT-based registration and 1.4–2.2 mm and 1.2–2.6° for MRI-based registration. Higher kinematic accuracy of CT-based registration was expected as MRI provides lower spatial resolution and bone contrast as compared to CT and suffers from spatial distortions. However, the MRI-based registration is within an acceptable accuracy for many clinical research questions.

N2  - Background: Numerous biomechanical studies have addressed normal shoulder function and the factors that affect it. While these investigations include a mix of in-vivo clinical reports, ex-vivo cadaveric studies, and computer-based simulations, each has its own strengths and limitations. A robust methodology is essential in cadaveric work but does not always come easily. Precise quantitative measurements are difficult in in-vivo studies, and simulation studies require validation steps. This review focuses on ex-vivo cadaveric studies to emphasize the best research methodologies available to simulate physiologically and clinically relevant shoulder motion. Methods: A PubMed and Web of Science search was conducted in March 2017 (and updated in May 2018) to identify the cadaveric studies focused on the shoulder and its function. The key words for this search included rotator cuff (RC) injuries, RC surgery, and their synonyms. The protocol of the study was registered on PROSPERO and is accessible at CRD42017068873. Results: Thirty one studies consisting of 167 specimens with various biomechanical methods met our inclusion criteria. All studies were level V cadaveric studies. Cadaveric biomechanical models are widely used to study shoulder instability and RC repair. These models are commonly limited to the glenohumeral joint by a fixed scapula, passively and discretely move the humerus, and statically load the RC without regard for the integrity of the glenohumeral capsule. Conclusion: All studies captured in this review evaluated shoulder biomechanics. Recent studies in patients suggest that some assumptions made in this space may not fully characterize motion of the human shoulder. With reproducible scapular positioning, dynamic RC activation, and preservation of glenohumeral capsule integrity, cadaveric studies can facilitate proper validation for simulation models and broaden our understanding of the shoulder environment during motion in healthy and disease states.

N2  - Background: Kinesiotaping is widely used for the rehabilitation of rotator cuff tendinopathy. It has been argued to reduce symptoms and functional limitations through improvement of proprioceptive feedback. In addition, kinesiotaping has been reported to increase the subacromial space in healthy subjects. However, its effects on the acromiohumeral distance and shoulder proprioception of individuals with rotator cuff tendinopathy have not been ascertained. This study investigated the immediate effects of kinesiotaping on the acromiohumeral distance and shoulder proprioception in individuals with rotator cuff tendinopathy. Methods: Twenty-two individuals with chronic rotator cuff tendinopathy were included. The acromiohumeral distance was measured using an ultrasound scanner at rest and 60° shoulder abduction. Proprioception was measured through active joint repositioning in low- (45°–65°) and mid-amplitude (80°–100°) of shoulder flexion and abduction. A wireless inertial measurement unit system was used to quantify shoulder angles. First, measurements were taken without kinesiotaping. Thereafter, kinesiotaping was applied on the symptomatic shoulder, and the same measurements were retaken. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used for statistical analyses. Findings: Kinesiotaping induced a significant increase in acromiohumeral distance at 60° abduction (∆AHD = 0.94 mm; 95%CI: 0.50–1.38, p < 0.001), exceeding the minimal detectable change (0.70 mm). No significant difference was observed in acromiohumeral distance at rest or in proprioception during active joint repositioning in both low- and mid-amplitude (p > 0.05). Interpretation: Kinesiotaping led to an immediate increase in acromiohumeral distance at 60° of abduction that, although it seems a minor change (↑10.5%), it may be significant for symptomatic patients, whereas it had no immediate effect on active joint repositioning.

N2  - Purpose: To introduce an arthroscopically assisted coracoclavicular (CC) fixation technique using multiple low-profile devices to evaluate the clinical and radiologic outcomes in patients with acute high-grade acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation. Methods: Between July 2014 and September 2015, cases of AC joint dislocation that were treated with arthroscopic CC fixation using multiple low-profile devices with a minimum follow-up of 24 months were included. We measured the vertical coracoclavicular distance (CCD) on the anteroposterior view and the horizontal acromioclavicular distance on 3-dimensional computed tomography images to evaluate the changes in radiologic outcomes before and after surgery. We compared final radiologic outcomes between initial AC reduction groups based on hierarchical clustering. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Constant-Murley score. Results: We enrolled 27 patients in total, and the mean follow-up period was 27.2 months. The mean CCD of the injured shoulder was 13.68 ± 3.98 mm preoperatively and decreased to 5.72 ± 1.68 mm immediately postoperatively but increased to 7.32 ± 2.29 mm at last follow-up (P = .07). Horizontal displacement of the distal clavicle was 1.1 ± 1.0 mm immediately postoperatively but decreased to 0.9 ± 0.6 mm at last follow-up (P < .05). In particular, in the 2 groups that were determined using the hierarchical cluster analysis, patients with excellent recovery of the initial CCD (20 patients) showed less of an increase in the CCD at last follow-up than did those in the other group (7 patients) (P < .001). The Constant-Murley score was 93.5 ± 2.7 points on the injured side at last follow-up (P = .074). Conclusions: Our CC fixation technique with multiple low-profile devices exhibited satisfactory clinical and radiologic outcomes. In particular, ensuring good initial recovery of the CCD and the precise placement and location of the AC joints was important in maintaining the proper AC position at the final follow-up. Level of Evidence: Level IV, case series.

N2  - Acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations are caused by sports injuries fall from height or traffic accidents. While the treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 in AC dislocations is conservative, the treatment of Type 4, 5 and 6 is surgery. Treatment of type III dislocations is controversial. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional results of patients who surgical treatment by using clavicle hook plate in Type III AC joint dislocations 21 patients (18 males, 3 females; mean age 34 years) with Type III AC joint dislocation who were admitted to our clinic between 2015-2017 were treated with clavicle hook plate. The surgical results of the patients at the 6th month were evaluated according to the Constant score. Of the total 21 patient included in the study, n=18 were male (%86), and n=3 were female (%14). All patients were treated with clavicular hook plate. The average follow-up after treatment is 11 months. Functional results were obtained according to Constant scoring. There was no infection after surgery. Plaque irritation occurred in 2 patients and plaque was removed due to prolonged pain. 1 patient had recurrence. Although conservative treatment of Type 3 AC dislocations can provide adequate functional results in the long term, we believe that early results of the surgical treatment using clavicle hook plate is a reliable and effective method especially in the young age group.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this anatomical study was to describe a local perforator flap, for covering shoulder defects, by determining the features of the acromial branch of the thoraco-acromial artery (abTAA), and the supplied cutaneous area. Methods: Thirteen fresh cadaveric thoraxes were dissected bilaterally. A precise and reproducible protocol was performed. For each abTAA flap cadaveric dissection, the following parameters were measured after arterial injection: distances between the origin of the perforator artery on the abTAA and the sternum, the acromion, the clavicle, diameter of the perforator artery of the abTAA, length of the perforator pedicle course through major pectoralis muscle, and rotation arc. We also calculated the surface of the injected skin paddle. These measurements were related to morphometric parameters evaluated through the distance between sternum and acromion. Results: The mean distances measured from the origin of the perforator artery on the abTAA were 14.25 cm to the sternum, 3.45 cm to the acromion, 5.65 cm to the clavicle. The mean diameter of the abTAA was 1.20 mm ± 0.2. The arc of rotation was 180°, and the length of the perforator pedicle could be extended to 7.46 cm ± 1.15. We observed an colored elliptical cutaneous paddle with a longer radius 18 cm and a small radius 15 cm. Conclusions: Our results suggest that this type of flap could be useful in clinical practice for reconstruction and covering of the acromial area with a thin cutaneous flap with low sequelae on the donor site.

N2  - This study examined the relationship between the recognition of movement and actual movement during the standing long jump. A total of 11 healthy elementary school children from 10 to 11 years of age participated in this study. Participants conducted standing long jumps (the target movement) after receiving video instruction. They were then tested on their recognition of the target movement according to an image. A total of 12 markers were then attached to each participant to measure the actual movements taken during subsequent performances of the target movement. They were then tested on the recognition of their own movements (a self-evaluation). The results were as follows: maximum shoulder angle was observed prior to each jump; this became successively lower in the image review, actual movement, and self-evaluation procedures. Knee flexion angle successively decreased in the actual, target, self-evaluation, and image movements during the railway crossing procedure. While jumping, the maximum shoulder angle was significantly larger in the target movement than the actual (P <.01) movement, but the actual movement was significantly lower than the image (P <.001) and self-evaluation (P <.001) movements. The angle between the perpendicular from the acromion and the line segment connecting the acromion to the lateral malleolus successively decreased in the target, image, self-evaluation, and actual movements. Thus, there were obvious points at which it was either easier or more difficult for subjects to recognize movements. Points of relative ease and difficulty were also identified during performance of the target movement.

N2  - AIMS: High string players (violin and viola) often suffer from musculoskeletal disorders. Although 3D motion analysis has proved helpful in diagnosing different musculoskeletal syndromes and identifying injurious movement patterns in violin and viola performance, more detailed analyses of upper body movement strategies and especially of the shoulder complex have not yet been recorded. The use of spherical surface markers on some anatomical landmarks is, however, inappropriate when an instrument is being played. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a novel marker-based method for analyzing upper body kinematics of high string players using conditions specific to violin and viola playing. METHODS: A custom upper body marker set was developed and a biomechanical model applied to 3D motion capture data of the pelvis, thorax, spine, head, and both upper limbs (scapula, upper arm, forearm, hand) of 12 professional violinists, to assess its clinical feasibility. FINDINGS: Lumbar and thoracic spine, thorax, neck, and left upper limb were quite static, while extensive motion occurred in the right upper limb. Most rotation angles showed a reasonable intersubject variability except for glenohumeral and wrist joints. Significant differences were observed between G- and D-string bowing, especially in the left wrist and right shoulder joints. INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that the proposed method is a valid tool for quantifying upper body movements in violin and viola performance. With the extended upper body model, it will improve understanding of the motor strategies adopted by high string players and may contribute to injury prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

N2  - Rotator cuff tears are known to affect clinical outcome of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). This study aimed to use computational modelling to quantify the effect of rotator cuff tear severity on muscle and joint forces after RSA, as well as stresses at the glenosphere, base-plate, fixation screws, scapula, and humeral components. A multi-body musculoskeletal model of the glenohumeral joint was developed comprising the scapula, humerus and nine major upper limb muscles. Simulations of abduction and flexion after RSA were performed in the case of the intact rotator cuff and tears to (i) supraspinatus; (ii) supraspinatus and infraspinatus, and (iii) supraspinatus, infraspinatus and subscapularis. The intact and supraspinatus deficient rotator cuff resulted in the largest calculated muscle forces, glenohumeral joint contact forces and implant stresses. Peak glenohumeral joint forces during flexion were lower than those during abduction in all cases; however, substantially more posterior joint shear force was generated during flexion than abduction. A tear involving the supraspinatus and infraspinatus reduced glenohumeral joint forces by a factor of 8.7 during abduction (603.1 N) and 7.1 during flexion (520.7 N) compared to those in the supraspinatus deficient shoulder. RSA with an intact or supraspinatus deficient rotator cuff produces large glenohumeral joint forces that may increase base-plate failure risk, particularly during flexion when posterior shear forces are largest. Infraspinatus tears after RSA greatly reduce glenohumeral joint compression and may ultimately reduce joint stability. Future research ought to focus on experimental validation of subject-specific muscle recruitment strategies and joint loading after RSA. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Shoulder function is directly related to scapular kinematics and the scapula has always been a part of shoulder rehabilitation. Kinesio Taping (KT) is a specific taping technique where flexible tapes indirectly stabilize underlying soft tissues to modify their behavior. KT has been utilized for scapular stabilization in shoulder rehabilitation but its effect on shoulder strength was not examined before. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this self-controlled therapeutic study was to assess the effect of KT on shoulder scapation (arm elevation in scapular plane) strength in healthy individuals. METHODS: This study was conducted on 160 shoulders of 80 healthy volunteers (34 males, 46 females; mean age: 23.8 [18-30]). The shoulder scaption strength was recorded, using an electronic dynamometer, as the maximal value of 3 consecutive measurements in two different forearm positions: 'palm down' and ' empty can'. Two sets of measurements, 3 days apart, were taken. The results of untaped and taped measurements were compared. Scapular taping, dominant side, forearm position, sex, and body mass index (BMI) were analyzed. RESULTS: The test-retest findings of both forearm positions were highly correlated with ICCs ranging 0.978-0.990. There was no significant difference in strength between ' without KT' and ' with KT', 69.46 ± 26.94 N vs 70.33 ± 28.01 N, respectively (p= 0.126). In both experimental conditions, forearm position did not affect strength There was no significant difference between the results without and with Kinesio Taping in both forearm positions: P= 0.458 (without), p= 0.141 (with). Dominant side and male sex resulted in superior scores (p= 0.0001) while a positive correlation was calculated between BMI and shoulder strength (p= 0.0001, r= 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our comparisons, scapular KT does not appear to influence scaption strength in healthy individuals.

N2  - Non-invasive, multi-parameter methods to estimate core body temperature offer several advantages for monitoring thermal strain, although further work is required to identify the most relevant predictor measures. This study aimed to compare the validity of an existing and two novel multi-parameter rectal temperature prediction models. Thirteen healthy male participants (age 30.9 ± 5.4 years) performed two experimental sessions. The experimental procedure comprised 15 min baseline seated rest (23.2 ± 0.3°C, 24.5 ± 1.6% relative humidity), followed by 15 min seated rest and cycling in a climatic chamber (35.4 ± 0.2°C, 56.5 ± 3.9% relative humidity; to +1.5°C or maximally 38.5°C rectal temperature, duration 20–60 min), with a final 30 min seated rest outside the chamber. In session 1, participants exercised at 75% of their heart rate maximum (HR max) and wore light athletic clothing (t-shirt and shorts), while in session 2, participants exercised at 50% HR max, wearing protective firefighter clothing (jacket and trousers). The first new prediction model, comprising the input of 18 non-invasive measures, i.e., insulated and non-insulated skin temperature, heat flux, and heart rate (“Max-Input Model”, standard error of the estimate [SEE] = 0.28°C, R2 = 0.70), did not exceed the predictive power of a previously reported model which included six measures and no insulated skin temperatures (SEE = 0.28°C, R2 = 0.71). Moreover, a second new prediction model that contained only the two most relevant parameters (heart rate and insulated skin temperature at the scapula) performed similarly (“Min-Input Model”, SEE = 0.29, R2 = 0.68). In conclusion, the “Min-Input Model” provided comparable validity and superior practicality (only two measurement parameters) for estimating rectal temperature versus two other models requiring six or more input measures.

N2  - Background: The pathomechanisms of eccentric osteoarthritis of the shoulder remain unclear. Although there is increasing evidence of bony differences between shoulders with rotator cuff tears and osteoarthritis, analogous differences have not been identified for primary concentric and eccentric osteoarthritis. This study examined the shape and orientation of the acromial roof as a potential risk factor for the development of posterior glenoid wear. Methods: We analyzed computed tomography images of 105 shoulders with primary osteoarthritis. Based on the classification of Walch, 45 shoulders had concentric osteoarthritis (Walch A) and 60 shoulders were affected by eccentric osteoarthritis (Walch B; EOA). A comparison of acromial morphology was performed in a multiplanar reconstruction analysis of computed tomography scans. Results: Acromial shape: Acromial length, width, and area were not significantly different. Acromial roof orientation: The acromial roof in EOA was an average of 5° flatter (sagittal tilt; P <.01) and 5° more downward tilted (coronal tilt; P <.01). There was no difference in axial rotation (axial tilt; P =.47). Anteroposterior glenoid coverage: The glenoid in EOA was covered an average of 4° less posteriorly (P =.01) and 4° more anteriorly (P =.04). No differences were shown for overall glenoid coverage. Conclusions: The acromial roof could play a role in the pathogenesis of EOA. Less posterior support due to a flatter acromion with less posterior glenoid coverage could contribute to static posterior subluxation of the humeral head and posterior glenoid wear. Further biomechanical investigations are needed to confirm these findings.

N2  - Background: Glenoid bone loss and capsular deficiency represent critical points of arthroscopic Bankart repair failures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an all-arthroscopic bone block procedure associated with arthroscopic subscapularis augmentation (ASA) for treating gleno-humeral instability with glenoid bone loss (GBL) and anterior capsulo-labral deficiency. Our hypothesis was that these two procedures could be combined arthroscopically. The feasibility of this technique and its reproducibility, and potential neurovascular complications were evaluated. Methods: A tricortical bone graft was harvested from the cadaveric clavicle, and in one case a Xenograft was used. An anterior-inferior GBL of about 25% was created. Two glenoid tunnels were set up from the posterior to the anterior side using a dedicated bone block guide, and four buttons were used to fix the graft to the glenoid. The subscapularis tenodesis was performed using a suture tape anchor. Afterwards, the shoulder was dissected to study the relationship between all portals and nerves. The size of the bone block, its position on the glenoid and the relationship with the subscapularis tendon were investigated. Results: In all seven specimens (five left and two right shoulders), the bone block was flush with the cartilage and fixed to the anterior-inferior part of the glenoid. No lesions of the surrounding neurovascular structures were observed. No interference was found between the two bone block tunnels and the anchor tunnel used for the tenodesis. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility and reproducibility of this combined arthroscopic technique (bone block associated with ASA) in the treatment of anterior shoulder instability associated with anterior bone loss and anterior capsular deficiency.

N2  - Aims In patients with a rotator cuff tear, tear pattern and tendon involvement are known risk factors for the development of pseudoparalysis of the shoulder. It remains unclear, however, why similar tears often have very different functional consequences. The present study hypothesizes that individual shoulder anatomy, specifically the moment arms (MAs) of the rotator cuff (RC) and the deltoid muscle, as well as their relative recruitment during shoulder abduction, plays a central role in pseudoparalysis. Materials and Methods Biomechanical and clinical analyses of the pseudoparalytic shoulder were conducted based on the ratio of the RC/deltoid MAs, which were used to define a novel anatomical descriptor called the Shoulder Abduction Moment (SAM) index. The SAM index is the ratio of the radii of two concentric spheres based on the centre of rotation of the joint. One sphere captures the humeral head (numerator) and the other the deltoid origin of the acromion (denominator). A computational rigid body simulation was used to establish the functional link between the SAM index and a potential predisposition for pseudoparalysis. A retrospective radiological validation study based on these measures was also undertaken using two cohorts with and without pseudoparalysis and massive RC tears. Results Decreased RC activity and improved glenohumeral stability was predicted by simulations of SAM indices with larger diameters of the humeral head, being consequently beneficial for joint stability. Clinical investigation of the SAM index showed significant risk of pseudoparalysis in patients with massive tears and a SAM < 0.77 (odds ratio (OR) 11). Conclusion The SAM index, which represents individual biomechanical characteristics of shoulder morphology, plays a determinant role in the presence or absence of pseudoparalysis in shoulders with massive RC tears.

N2  - There is no agreement within literature regarding management of scapula fractures. Our aim was to carry out a systematic review of literature on management of the scapular fractures. Our search across multiple medical databases for studies on the scapular fractures until February 2014 yielded 32 studies. We have excluded case series <7 patients, case reports, review articles, articles without abstract, observational studies and articles on fractures following shoulder arthroplasty. There were 8 prospective case series and one cohort study, however, majority of the included studies were retrospective studies. There were 1237 patients, follow up data were available for 941 patients who underwent either conservative (629) or operative management (512). Non-operative management scapular body fractures had satisfactory results. The scapular neck fractures displaced <10mm have satisfactory outcome following non-operative management. Operative management of displaced glenoid fossa fractures and scapular neck fractures displaced >10mm lead in a better functional outcome.

N2  - Background: This study evaluated the functional outcomes of bipolar pedicled pectoralis major (PM) transfer to restore elbow flexion. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 29 transfers in 28 patients with a mean age of 31.2 years (range, 5-65 years). The loss of elbow flexion was due to brachial plexus palsy in 24 patients, elbow flexors necrosis in 4, and poliomyelitis in 1. The entire PM muscle was mobilized and fixed proximally to the coracoid process. Intraoperative positioning and postoperative immobilization of the shoulder and the elbow flexed at 60° and 120°, respectively, allowed direct distal fixation of the muscle to the biceps brachii tendon. Results: At the last follow-up (mean, 13 months; range, 4-37 months), 41% of the transfers (n = 12) recovered grade 4 elbow flexion strength and were able to lift 2.2 kg on average (range, 0.5-5 kg), 52% (n = 15) recovered grade 3 strength, and 7% (n = 2) had a poor result (ie, grade 2 elbow flexion). The mean active elbow flexion was 100° (ranging, 30°-150°), and the patients had 0° to 10° elbow flexion contracture. Conclusions: Our results indicate that bipolar PM transfer is a reliable and effective procedure to restore elbow flexion. Flexion of the shoulder and elbow allowed the transfer to reach the elbow fold and avoided an interposition graft between the distal PM and the biceps brachii tendon.

N2  - Background: Rotator cuff tears (RCTs) are generally considered to occur at the age of 40 to 50, but some becomes massive tears at the age of 60 to 70 if neglected. This study evaluated preoperative factors affecting tear size and reparability of rotator cuffs based on magnetic resonance imaging findings among patients older than age 70. Methods: We identified 270 patients with full-thickness RCTs (175 reparable tears, group A; 95 irreparable tears, group B) that were confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging findings from January 2009 to March 2016. Irreparable tear was identified if all of the following criteria were met: (1) a large to massive RCT based on the DeOrio and Cofield classification, (2) sum of preoperative global fatty degeneration index of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus ≥6, and (3) positive tangent sign. Preoperative variables included demographic data, medical history, and radiologic data. Acromial index, critical shoulder angle, and acromiohumeral interval (AHI) were evaluated to investigate the relationship between anatomic factors and reparability of RCT. Results: Stepwise multivariated regression analysis revealed older age, longer symptom duration, longer duration of overhead sports activity, lower preoperative forward elevation of the shoulder joint, and shorter AHI as risk factors for irreparable RCTs. Conclusions: This study suggests that older age at surgery, longer duration of symptoms, longer duration of overhead sports activity, lower preoperative forward elevation of the shoulder joint, and shorter AHI are independent risk factors for irreparable RCT.

N2  - CONTEXT: Scapular proprioception is a key concern in managing shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS). However, no study has examined the effect of elastic taping on scapular proprioception performance.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immediate effect of kinesiology taping (KT) on scapular reposition accuracy, kinematics, and muscle activation in individuals with SIS.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled study.
SETTING: Musculoskeletal laboratory, National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty overhead athletes with SIS.
INTERVENTIONS: KT or placebo taping over the upper and lower trapezius muscles.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were scapular joint position sense, measured as the reposition errors, in the direction of scapular elevation and protraction. The secondary outcomes were scapular kinematics and muscle activity of the upper trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior during arm elevation in the scapular plane (scaption).
RESULTS: Compared with placebo taping, KT significantly decreased the reposition errors of upward/downward rotation (P = .04) and anterior/posterior tilt (P = .04) during scapular protraction. KT also improved scapular kinematics (significant group by taping effect for posterior tilt, P = .03) during scaption. Kinesiology and placebo tapings had a similar effect on upper trapezius muscle activation (significant taping effect, P = .003) during scaption.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified the positive effects of KT on scapular joint position sense and movement control. Future studies with a longer period of follow-up and clinical measurement might help to clarify the clinical effect and mechanisms of elastic taping in individuals with SIS.

N2  - Introduction: To compare percutaneous minimally invasive repair (PMIR) of acute acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation under ultrasound guidance (PMIR-UN) vs. C-arm navigation (PMIR-CN). Hypothesis: PMIR-UN has similar functional and radiographic outcomes as PMIR-CN. Materials and methods: We treated 48 patients with acute grade III or V AC joint dislocation with surgical reduction and fixation with Kirschner wires and cannulated screws. The patients were randomly divided into a PMIR-UN group (n = 24) and a PMIR-CN group (n = 24). We assessed functional outcomes, operative duration, incision length, and intraoperative radiation exposure. Shoulder joint function was evaluated with the Constant–Murley score, and postoperative efficacy was evaluated using the Karlsson criteria. Results: The median follow-up duration was 13 months (range, 8–18 months). Satisfactory functional outcomes were obtained in both groups. Incision length, incidence of postoperative infection, pin migration, and postoperative efficacy did not differ between the two groups. Operative duration and intraoperative radiation dose were significantly greater in the PMIR-CN group than in the PMIR-UN group (P < 0.05). Kirschner wires were removed at 4 weeks after surgery, and cannulated screws were removed at 12 weeks after surgery in both groups. Discussion: Based on the satisfactory results obtained in all patients, we conclude that PMIR-UN is a safe, easy, and reliable technique for the treatment of acute grade III or V AC joint dislocation. Type of study: Low-powered prospective randomized trial. Level of evidence: Level II.

N2  - The Trillat procedure performed as open surgery to treat anterior shoulder instability has been proven effective in preventing recurrences and restoring range of motion. An arthroscopically assisted variant of the Trillat procedure is described here, together with the preliminary clinical results in 18 patients treated between 2011 and 2014. After a mean follow-up of 24.7 ± 9.8 months, the clinical outcomes were very satisfactory, with a Walch-Duplay score of 81.5 ± 18.0, a Rowe score of 83.6 ± 16.0, and 94% of satisfied or very satisfied patients. Mean operative time was 55 ± 13 min. No recurrences were recorded. As an easily performed procedure that provides good clinical outcomes, the arthroscopically assisted Trillat procedure is a simple and reproducible alternative to arthroscopic Latarjet procedure, which is still reserved for highly experienced surgical teams.

N2  - Reverse shoulder arthroplasty is now the standard treatment for displaced, three- or four-part, proximal humeral fractures in patients older than 70 years. Inadequate tuberosity repair or inappropriate humeral stem position are associated with poorer outcomes, notably regarding rotation and stability. Strict operative technique during prosthesis implantation is therefore crucial to obtain reliable and reproducible outcomes. The objective of this article is to describe the surgical technique for reverse shoulder arthroplasty used to treat recent proximal humerus fractures.

N2  - Background: Knowing the reliability of three-dimensional motion analysis to evaluate scapular kinematics during upper limb movements is essential to plan further research dedicated to understanding scapulothoracic joint movements relative to the global shoulder motion. Research question: The aim of this study was to assess the intra-subject as well as intra- and interrater reliability of scapulothoracic joint angles during shoulder elevation in scapular plane and shoulder flexion. Methods: Twenty healthy participants (26.6 ± 3.5 years) were asked to perform maximum shoulder elevation in scapular plane as well as shoulder flexion. Reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and its 95% confidence interval of scapular kinematics (rotation, tilting, pro-retraction) at each degree of global motion (shoulder elevation or shoulder flexion) between 0° to 150°. Results: ICCs above 0.60 were accepted as good indicators for reliability. Intra-subject reliability was found to be very high (>0.9 for most part) for all scapulothoracic joint angles during both movements. Intra- and interrater reliability also showed good reliability being above 0.60 for the most part (except scapula tilting during shoulder elevation). Scapular kinematics showed low reliability during the respective first 10° and 20° of shoulder elevation and shoulder flexion. Furthermore, decreasing reliability was found above 120° of shoulder elevation or flexion. Significance: This study generally showed good to high levels of reliability in the range of interest (20–120°) in evaluating scapula kinematics in healthy adults during shoulder elevation and flexion; these results are important for future research providing a better understanding of scapular kinematics.

N2  - Scapula dyskinesis is prevalent in athletes conducting forceful overhead movements. This review summarizes our current understanding of the condition and evaluates the different options for assessing dyskinesis. Current methods for assessing scapula dyskinesis involve clinical observations, three-dimensional kinematics and three-dimensional wing computer tomography. Clinical observation is the most pragmatic method for assessing dyskinesis yielding inter-rater agreement of 79% and sensitivity of 76%. Similar sensitivities have been recorded using three-dimensional kinematics. Three-dimensional wing computer tomography has yielded a near-perfect interclass correlation coefficient of 0.972 when used to assess dyskinesis. Three-dimensional wing computer tomography, given its expense, low availability, and levels of irradiation, should be reserved for high-performance athletes where detailed assessments need to be made to aid rehabilitation. Observational assessments should remain the main modality used for general assessment.

N2  - Background: The lateral extension of the acromion from the glenohumeral joint is the critical variable that both the acromial index and critical shoulder angle reflect. The purpose of this study was to establish a simple and reproducible method to directly measure the lateral extension of the acromion that will be independent of patient demographic characteristics, scapular rotation, or other morphologic features of the shoulder. Methods: This study used 128 unpaired cadaveric scapulae with a mean age of 69.4 ± 11.1 years (66 right and 62 left scapulae, 65 female and 63 male cadaveric specimens). The lateral extension of the acromion was measured from the supraglenoid tubercle to the most lateral point of the acromion with a digital caliper placed perpendicular to the scapula long axis. This distance was called the “lateral offset of the acromion.” Results: The lateral offset was 2.62 ± 0.72 cm in men and 2.69 ± 0.73 cm in women. The offset was 2.61 ± 0.66 cm in right and 2.70 ± 0.78 cm in left scapulae. The offset in the group aged 46-60 years was 2.85 ± 0.76 cm; in the group aged 61-75 years, it was 2.62 ± 0.76 cm; and in the group aged 76 years or older, it was 2.54 ± 0.60 cm. No significant difference was found between any of the groups. Conclusions: This study established a simple method to directly measure the lateral extension of the acromion based on the longitudinal axis of the scapula, which eliminates bias that may exist in the acromial index and critical shoulder angle from the position of the scapula and glenoid inclination. The lateral offset was found to be independent of sex, side, or age, limiting bias in a potential future clinical application.

N2  - Background: Shoulder pain is the most common complaint for wheelchair athletes. Scapular orientation and dyskinesia are thought to be associated with shoulder pathology, yet no previous studies have examined the bilateral scapula kinematics of wheelchair athletes during propulsion. Research question: To examine bilateral scapular kinematics of highly trained wheelchair rugby (WR) players and any associations with self-reported shoulder pain during everyday wheelchair propulsion. Methods: Ten WR players (5 with shoulder pain, 5 without) performed 2 × 3-minute bouts of exercise in their everyday wheelchair on a wheelchair ergometer at two sub-maximal speeds (3 and 6 km h−1). During the final minute, 3D kinematic data were collected at 100 Hz to describe scapulothoracic motion relative to each propulsion cycle. Instantaneous asymmetries in scapular orientation between dominant and non-dominant sides were also reported. Differences in scapular kinematics and propulsion asymmetries were compared across shoulders symptomatic and asymptomatic of pain. Results: An internally rotated, upwardly rotated and anteriorly tilted scapula was common during wheelchair propulsion and asymmetries ≤14° did exist, yet minimal changes were observed across speeds. Participants with bilateral shoulder pain displayed a less upwardly rotated scapula during propulsion, however large inter-individual variability in scapular kinematics was noted. Significance: Scapular asymmetries are exhibited by wheelchair athletes during wheelchair propulsion, yet these were not exacerbated by increased speed and had limited associations to shoulder pain. This suggests that propulsion kinematics of highly trained athletes may not be the primary cause of pain experienced by this population.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Augmented reality is a technology that simulates a 3-dimensional virtual field. The physical therapist considered AR measurement program be a more efficient measure of ROM. as set at p<0.05. Method/Statistical analysis: Forty healthy agreed and participated in the study. This study used AR-based motion analysis and Electro goniometer to measure ROM of each joint: shoulder joint, elbow joint, hip joint and knee joint. Volunteers performed three motion.: 45° shoulder abduction and 45° hip abduction in standing position(M1), 90° shoulder abduction, 90° elbow flexion, 90° hip flexion and 90° knee flexion in standing position(M2) and 90° shoulder flexion and 90° knee flexion in standing position(M3). Findings: This study investigated the difference between ROM measured by AR-based motion analysis and physical therapist`s manual used electro goniometer. ROM measurement of the used AR-based motion analysis and electro goniometer has similarly results. The ROM significantly difference with the 90° shoulder abduction measured motion analysis and electro goniometer. However, no significant difference was observed another motion at the M1, M2 and M3 position except the shoulder abduction 90°. Markerless Single camera motion analysis was successful measurement, the frontal and sagittal plane joint angles calculated from the markerless system. And both plane showed coefficient of reliability <0.5° for all angles. only 90° shoulder abduction has significant difference. For 180° shoulder abduction, scapular`s upward rotation angle is 60° and humerus` abduction angle is 120° should be considered. This is a scapulohumeral rhythm. 90° shoulder abduction at M2 appeared scapulohumeral rhythm so it has significant difference. Improvements/Applications: Measurement using AR based motion analysis and electro goniometer were similarly to measure ROM. So motion analysis is easy to use and save the evaluation time.

N2  - The relationship between shoulder pain and scapular dyskinesis (SDK) is unclear. Differences between groups with and without SDK have been demonstrated, focusing on the amount of scapular motion at specific degrees of humeral elevation. However, this approach does not consider the temporal information and shape of the scapular motion temporal series. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) may clarify this variability and advance current understanding of ‘abnormal’ movement patterns. This study aimed to evaluate the scapular kinematics in patients with shoulder pain and in asymptomatic participants with and without SDK using PCA. Data were collected in 98 participants separated in four groups: Pain + SDK (n = 24), Pain (n = 25), No Pain + SDK (n = 24), and No Pain (n = 25). Scapulothoracic kinematic data were measured with an electromagnetic tracking device during arm elevation and lowering phases. PCA and analysis of variance were used to compare the groups. The No Pain + SDK group had a progressive increasing in anterior tilt over the elevation phase compared to the Pain (effect size = 0.79) and No Pain (effect size = 0.80) groups. During the arm-lowering, the Pain + SDK group had a progressive increasing in anterior tilt over this phase in comparison to the No Pain + SDK group (effect size = 0.68). Therefore, PCA demonstrated differences in the scapular anterior tilt related to SDK and shoulder pain. The presence of SDK revealed a scapular pattern with progressive increasing in anterior tilt over the elevation phase. However, during the arm-lowering phase, asymptomatic participants with SDK changed their motion pattern, unlike the symptomatic group, reinforcing the suggested association between scapular modifications and shoulder symptoms.

N2  - Core body temperature (TC) is a key physiological metric of thermal heat-strain yet it remains difficult to measure non-invasively in the field. This work used combinations of observations of skin temperature (TS), heat flux (HF), and heart rate (HR) to accurately estimate TC using a Kalman Filter (KF). Data were collected from eight volunteers (age 22 ± 4 yr, height 1.75 ± 0.10 m, body mass 76.4 ± 10.7 kg, and body fat 23.4 ± 5.8%, mean ± standard deviation) while walking at two different metabolic rates (∼350 and ∼550 W) under three conditions (warm: 25 °C, 50% relative humidity (RH); hot-humid: 35 °C, 70% RH; and hot-dry: 40 °C, 20% RH). Skin temperature and HF data were collected from six locations: pectoralis, inner thigh, scapula, sternum, rib cage, and forehead. Kalman filter variables were learned via linear regression and covariance calculations between TC and TS, HF, and HR. Root mean square error (RMSE) and bias were calculated to identify the best performing models. The pectoralis (RMSE 0.18 ± 0.04 °C; bias −0.01 ± 0.09 °C), rib (RMSE 0.18 ± 0.09 °C; bias −0.03 ± 0.09 °C), and sternum (RMSE 0.20 ± 0.10 °C; bias −0.04 ± 0.13 °C) were found to have the lowest error values when using TS, HF, and HR but, using only two of these measures provided similar accuracy.

N2  - Center of mass (CoM) velocity variation in swimming direction is related to swimming performance and efficiency. However, it is difficult to calculate the CoM velocity during swimming. Therefore, we aimed to establish a practical estimation method for the CoM velocity in swimming direction during front crawl swimming with underwater cameras. Ten swimmers were recorded during front crawl swimming (25 m, maximal effort) using a motion capture system with 18 underwater and 9 land cameras. Three CoM velocity estimation methods were constructed (single-hip velocity, both-hips velocity, and both-hips velocity with simulated arm velocity correction). Each model was validated against the actual CoM velocity. The difference between the single-hip velocity and the actual CoM velocity in swimming direction was significantly larger compared with that of the other 2 models. Furthermore, the accuracy of CoM velocity estimation was increased when both-hips velocity was corrected using the simulated arm velocity. The method allowed estimation of the CoM velocity with only 2 underwater cameras with a maximal difference of 0.06 m·s-1. This study established a novel and practical method for the estimation of the CoM velocity in swimming direction during front crawl swimming.

N2  - Introduction Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA) anatomical, reverse or both is an increasingly popular procedure but the glenoid component is still a weak element, accounting for 30–50% of mechanical complications and contributing to the revision burden. Component mal-positioning is one of the main aetiological factors in glenoid failure and thus Patient-Specific Instrumentation (PSI) has been introduced in an effort to optimise implant placement. The aim of this systematic literature review and meta-analysis is to compare the success of PSI and Standard Instrumentation (STDI) methods in reproducing pre-operative surgical planning of glenoid component positioning. Material and methods A search (restricted to English language) was conducted in November 2017 on MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov. Using the search terms “Patient-Specific Instrumentation (PSI)”, “custom guide”, “shoulder”, “glenoid” and “arthroplasty”, 42 studies were identified. The main exclusion criteria were: no CT-scan analysis results; studies done on plastic bone; and use of a reusable or generic guide. Eligible studies evaluated final deviations from the planning for version, inclination, entry point and rotation. Reviewers worked independently to extract data and assess the risk of bias on the same studies. Results The final analysis included 12 studies, comprising 227 participants (seven studies on 103 humans and five studies on 124 cadaveric specimens). Heterogeneity was moderate or high for all parameters. Deviations from the pre-operative planning for version (p<0.01), inclination (p<0.01) and entry point (p = 0.02) were significantly lower with the PSI than with the STDI, but not for rotation (p = 0.49). Accuracy (deviation from planning) with PSI was about 1.88 to 4.96, depending on the parameter. The number of component outliers (>10 of deviation or 4mm) were significantly higher with STDI than with PSI (68.6% vs 15.3% (p = 0.01)). Conclusion This review supports the idea that PSI enhances glenoid component positioning, especially a decrease in the number of outliers. However, the findings are not definitive and further validation is required. It should be noted that no randomised clinical studies are available to confirm long-term outcomes.

N2  - Background: Strength testing is an important aspect of shoulder examination. To date, strength assessment has many limitations. There is no single standard instrument for measuring, and various current devices have problems in reliability, accuracy, and cost. This study compared the results of an innovative and simple method of strength testing (weighing machine) with an existing method (isometric dynamometer). Methods: Shoulder strength was tested in 80 individuals, 60 with normal shoulders (group 1) and 20 with shoulder pathology (group 2). Strength was tested in the standard position of 90° of elevation in the scapular plane (scaption) with the elbow extended and forearm pronated while resistance was applied just proximal to the wrist. A weighing machine and an isometric dynamometer were used for strength testing. Results: There was a mean difference of 0.26 kg in group 1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.36; P <.0001) and 0.30 kg in group 2 (95% CI, 0,04-0,72; P =.0291) between the weighing machine and the isometric dynamometer. Although statistically significant, these differences were not clinically significant. Conclusions: This pilot study shows that strength assessment by an innovative and simpler technique with a weighing machine gives similar results as an isometric dynamometer.

N2  - Ultrasonography (US) is a useful diagnostic method that can be easily applied to identify the cause of shoulder pain. Its low cost, excellent diagnostic accuracy, and capability for dynamic evaluation are also advantages. To assess all possible causes of shoulder pain, it is better to follow a standardized protocol and to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the shoulder than to conduct a focused examination. Moreover, a proper dynamic study can enhance the diagnostic quality of US, especially when the pathology is not revealed by a static evaluation. The purpose of this article is to review the common indications for dynamic US of the shoulder, and to present the basic techniques and characteristic US findings.

N2  - Background: Evaluation of scapular dyskinesis is of clinical interest because it is believed to be associated with pathologies of the shoulder. This study investigated the feasibility of plain-film radiography in evaluating scapular dyskinesis. Methods: Subjects with unilateral disorders of the shoulder (n = 186) who underwent plain-film radiography of bilateral scapulae were divided into 4 categories of scapular dyskinesis patterns according to the Kibler classification and analyzed. Coracoid upward shift distance (CUSD), length of the scapular spine line (LSS), and scapular upward rotation angle (SURA) were measured on the radiographs. Intrarater and inter-rater reliability were tested, and the characteristics of these parameters in each type were analyzed. The differences (d) between bilateral scapulae (d-CUSD, d-LSS, and d-SURA) among the 4 categories were compared. Results: Intrarater and inter-rater reliability were excellent for all parameters. Significant differences between the scapulae were observed in CUSD in type I and in LSS in type II categories. No significant difference in any of the parameters was found in type III. Compared with the other categories, d-CUSD in type I and d-LSS in type II were significantly larger. The cutoff values of d-CUSD and d-LSS were 1.1 mm and 1.2 mm, respectively. No significant difference in d-SURA was found among the 4 categories. Conclusions: The measurement of CUSD, LSS, and SURA on plain-film radiography had excellent reliability. d-CUSD and d-LSS were characteristic parameters of type I and type II, respectively; however, type III had no distinguishing characteristics among the parameters.

N2  - Study Design. Retrospective analysis. Objective. To describe the dynamic fluctuation of truncal shift parameters during quiet standing in healthy young individuals using biomechanical analyses. Summary of Background Data. Coronal decompensation (CD) and sagittal vertical axis (SVA) are the key radiographic parameters to assess static truncal stability, with the known cut-off value of 4 cm for SVA in determining severity of spinal deformity. These values are obtained at a specific moment during quiet standing, when the posture innately changes. Thus, unassessed truncal sway could potentially compromise the reliability of these measurements. Methods. Previously obtained biomechanical data with 11 male, healthy participants aged 16 to 29 were used to quantify the dynamic sway of standing posture. The participants were instructed to quietly stand with surface reflective markers for 130 seconds. The midpoint of bilateral acromia was used as a surrogate for C7 vertebral body. The time series of coronal and sagittal shifts of C7 to sacrum were measured as quasi-coronal decompensation (CD) and quasi-sagittal vertical axis (SVA) to simulate CD and SVA on radiographs. A force platform was also used to measure the center of pressure (COP) displacement. Results. The group averages of the dynamic sway range were 20.2 ± 4.1 mm (range: 15.1-28.6) in the sagittal plane (quasi-SVA) and 9.8 ± 3.2 mm (range: 5.5-15.2) in the coronal plane (quasi-CD). There were significant correlations between quasi-CD sway and medial-lateral COP velocity (Pearson r = 0.65, P = 0.03), as well as between quasi-SVA sway and COP sway area (r = 0.65, P = 0.03). Conclusion. Given the considerable fluctuation of quasi-SVA and quasi-CD during quiet standing, the reliability of radiographic measurement using CD and SVA at a specific moment can be substantially compromised. The assessment based on the currently proposed cut-off values should be interpreted with caution, and repeat examinations are warranted.

N2  - Background: There is no standard method for the surgical treatment of acromioclavicular (AC) joint separations. Current techniques have associated complications, including need for device removal, coracoid fracture, and inadequate reduction. Purpose: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of an internal splint technique without graft augmentation or rigid fixation to treat acute Rockwood type IV and V AC joint injuries. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of 26 patients who underwent a novel internal splint fixation technique between 2011 and 2016. Patients had type IV (n = 2) and type V (n = 24) acute AC separations. The mean time to surgery was 13.7 days (range, 1-28 days). The surgical technique included an open approach with coracoclavicular suture and tape fixation and AC suture fixation. Range of motion, strength, and radiographs were evaluated after surgery. Patient follow-up included the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) questionnaire at a mean 3.3 years postoperatively (range, 6 months–8.6 years). DASH questionnaires were obtained for all patients via email. Patients were also surveyed on cosmetic appearance and willingness to undergo the operation again. Results: All patients regained full strength and range of motion following surgery. All postoperative radiographs demonstrated well-maintained reduction of the AC joint. The mean DASH score was 3.4 at final follow-up, and 23 of 26 respondents were satisfied with their postoperative shoulder appearance. There were no reoperations, and all patients stated that they would have the operation again given the same circumstances. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate a reliable new technique for acute fixation of type IV or V AC joint injuries via an internal splint construct. This technique enables reduction in the coronal and sagittal planes without the need for graft augmentation or a rigid implant, allowing healing of the coracoclavicular and AC ligaments.

N2  - Background: The human shoulder joint is the most mobile joint in the body. While in vivo shoulder kinematics under minimally loaded conditions have been studied, it is unclear how glenohumeral cartilage responds to high-demand loaded exercise. Hypothesis: A high-demand upper extremity exercise, push-ups, will induce compressive strain in the glenohumeral articular cartilage, which can be measured with validated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–based techniques. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: High-resolution MRI was used to measure in vivo glenohumeral cartilage thickness before and after exercise among 8 study participants with no history of upper extremity injury or disease. Manual MRI segmentation and 3-dimensional modeling techniques were used to generate pre- and postexercise thickness maps of the humeral head and glenoid cartilage. Strain was calculated as the difference between pre- and postexercise cartilage thickness, normalized to the pre-exercise cartilage thickness. Results: Significant compressive cartilage strains of 17% ± 6% and 15% ± 7% (mean ± 95% CI) were detected in the humeral head and glenoid cartilage, respectively. The anterior region of the glenoid cartilage experienced a significantly higher mean strain (19% ± 6%) than the posterior region of the glenoid cartilage (12% ± 8%). No significant regional differences in postexercise humeral head cartilage strain were observed. Conclusion: Push-ups induce compressive strain on the glenohumeral joint articular cartilage, particularly at the anterior glenoid. This MRI-based methodology can be applied to further the understanding of chondral changes in the shoulder under high-demand loading conditions. Clinical Relevance: These results improve the understanding of healthy glenohumeral cartilage mechanics in response to loaded upper extremity exercise. In the future, these methods can be applied to identify which activities induce high glenohumeral cartilage strains and deviations from normal shoulder function.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Several etiologic factors have been postulated in overhead athletes according to their shoulder injuries, such as the scapular posture asymmetries. The measurement of the acromion border distance has been considered as reliable clinical test for evaluating the static scapula posture. The aim of this study was to quantify the differences in scapular posture between the dominant and non-dominant shoulders in two static positions in volleyball and swimmers athletes with asymptomatic shoulder injuries using the sliding calliper device.
METHODS: Twenty athletes involved in volleyball and swimming sports were recruited. Their mean age was 25.4±8.09 years and BMI 22.68±1.63 kg/cm2. All athletes had asymptomatic traumatic shoulder injuries. Two clinical tests were used to estimate scapula posture between the two groups of athletes using a sliding calliper device. In the first method the distance between the posterior border of the acromion in supine position and the table (AT) was measured, and in the second one the distance between the posterior border of the acromion and the wall (AW) was measured in standing.
RESULTS: Statistical significant differences found in AW position in the volleyball compared with swimmer athletes (F=8.883, S=0.008, P<0.05). The difference in scapula posture in AW position was higher (14.90±4.99 mm) in the volleyball than in swimmers athletes (8.34±4.84).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings could have implications using the assessment of acromion border as an outcome measure of the scapula asymmetry posture in overhead athletes with asymptomatic shoulder injuries. Due to the limited sample size, this study should be considered as pilot.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The optimal procedure for anterior shoulder instability with a borderline (15%-20%) bone defect on the anterior rim of the glenoid is still controversial. PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcome and recurrence rate between the arthroscopic Bankart repair and Latarjet procedure among patients with recurrent anterior shoulder instability and a borderline glenoid bone defect. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed cases of arthroscopic Bankart repair and the Latarjet procedure for recurrent anterior shoulder instability with a borderline (15%-20%) glenoid bone defect. Enrollment comprised 149 patients (Bankart group, n = 118; Latarjet group, n = 31). The mean follow-up and age at operation were 28.9 ± 7.3 months (range, 24-73 months) and 26 ± 5 years (range, 16-46 years), respectively. RESULTS: Rowe and UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) shoulder scores significantly improved from 42.0 ± 14.3 and 22.9 ± 3.2 preoperatively to 90.9 ± 15.4 and 32.5 ± 3.3 postoperatively in the Bankart group ( P < .001) and from 41.0 ± 17.9 and 22.3 ± 3.4 to 91.1 ± 16.1 and 32.3 ± 3.4 in the Latarjet group ( P < .001), respectively. There were no significant between-group differences in Rowe ( P = .920) or UCLA ( P = .715) scores at the final follow-up. Mean postoperative loss of motion during forward flexion, external rotation in abduction, and internal rotation to the posterior was 3.0° ± 6.2°, 11.6° ± 10.2°, and 0.6 spinal segment in the Bankart group and 3.7° ± 9.8°, 10.3° ± 12.8°, and 0.9 spinal segment in the Latarjet group, respectively. These differences were not significant. However, the loss of external rotation at the side was significantly greater in the Bankart group (13.3° ± 12.9°) than in the Latarjet group (7.3° ± 18.1°, P = .034). The overall recurrence rate was significantly higher in the Bankart group (22.9%) than in the Latarjet group (6.5%), ( P = .040). CONCLUSION: The Latarjet procedure and arthroscopic Bankart repair both provided satisfactory clinical outcome scores and pain relief for anterior shoulder instability with a borderline glenoid bone defect. However, the Latarjet procedure resulted in significantly lower recurrences and less external rotation limitation than the arthroscopic Bankart repair. Therefore, the Latarjet procedure could be a more reliable surgical option in anterior recurrent instability with a borderline glenoid bone defect.

N2  - Background Quantitative assessment of rotator cuff muscle activity is important in the treatment of shoulder disorders. However, the known methods for assessing rotator cuff muscle activity thus far have been inaccurate, invasive, and inconvenient. Questions/purposes (1) Does the activity of the deltoid, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles measured using ultrasound shear wave elastography have a linear correlation with muscle activity assessed using generally used methods, including isokinetic dynamometry and electromyography? (2) Does the activity of the deltoid supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles measured using shear wave elastography show good intraobserver and interobserver reliability? Methods Twelve volunteers participated in intrasession reliability experiments. They were asked to perform isometric abduction, external rotation, and scaption contractions (defined as elevation of the arm within the plane of the scapula with neutral arm rotation) gradually increased from 0% to 75% of maximal voluntary contraction. The joint torque, electromyographic activity, and shear elastic modulus were synchronously measured in the middeltoid, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles. The validity of the elastic modulus value was assessed using regression analysis between normalized torque and electromyographic root mean square values. For intraobserver and interobserver reliability measurements, repeated experiments were performed with the same protocol. Results The shear elastic modulus and normalized joint torque with isokinetic dynamometry showed a linear relationship in all muscles (deltoid, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus) and each of the ultrasonography planes (longitudinal and transverse) (mean R2 > 0.8 and p < 0.001 for all measurements). For the supraspinatus muscle, the mean slope of the relationship between shear elastic modulus in the longitudinal plane and the normalized joint torque during scaption contraction was 1.28 6 0.39 kPa/% MVC (mean R2 = 0.93 6 0.21, p < 0.001). Furthermore, similar results were obtained in relation to electromyography root mean square values (mean R2 > 0.8 and p < 0.001 in all measurements). For the supraspinatus muscle, the mean slope of the relationship between shear elastic modulus in the longitudinal plane and electromyographic (EMG) root mean square was 0.96 6 0.27 kPa/% EMG (mean R2 = 0.91 6 0.08, p < 0.001). The intraobserver and interobserver reliabilities were excellent in all positions (abduction, external rotation, and scaption) and in both the longitudinal and transverse ultrasonography planes (all intraclass correlation coefficients are > 0.85). Conclusions Shoulder muscle activity can be noninvasively evaluated with ultrasound shear wave elastography. Clinician and scientists should consider the application of this technique in cases in which evaluation of shoulder muscle activity is required. The next step after this study will be to check the shear elastic modulus of rotator cuff muscle in patients with rotator cuff tear.We plan to evaluate the correlation between shear elastic modulus and joint torque according to tear size and fatty infiltration status of rotator cuff muscle. Clinical Relevance Shear wave electrography can be used to measure various tissue elasticities in both static and dynamic modes. It may be a useful tool to evaluate pre- and postoperative rotator cuff muscle activity in a relatively simple manner. Shoulder function after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty associated with deltoid muscle activity also may be evaluated. Changes in tissue tightness in shoulder disorders caused by increase soft tissue stiffness (ie, adhesive capsulitis and glenohumeral internal rotation deficit) can be evaluated.

N2  - CONTEXT:   Performing shoulder-abduction exercises with scapular retraction has been theorized to reduce the potential for shoulder impingement. However, objective data to support this premise are lacking.
OBJECTIVE:   To evaluate the influence of active scapular retraction on acromiohumeral distance (AHD) at 4 shoulder-abduction angles using real-time ultrasound.
DESIGN:   Cross-sectional study.
SETTING:   University laboratory.
PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS:   Twenty asymptomatic individuals (10 men, 10 women; age = 22.9 ± 2.8 years, height = 169.3 ± 9.5 cm, mass = 65.5 ± 12.9 kg) were recruited.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S):   Real-time ultrasound images of AHD were obtained during nonretracted and retracted scapular conditions at 0°, 45°, 60°, and 90° of shoulder abduction. A 2-factor analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to evaluate the influence of shoulder retraction on AHD across shoulder-abduction angles.
RESULTS:   A scapular-retraction condition × shoulder-abduction-angle interaction for AHD was found ( F3,57 = 4.56, P = .006). The AHD was smaller at 0° (10.5 versus 11.2 mm, respectively; t19 = 2.22, P = .04) but larger at 90° (9.4 versus 8.7 mm, respectively; t19 = -2.30, P = .04) of shoulder abduction during the retracted than the nonretracted condition. No differences in AHD were observed between conditions at 45° ( t19 = 1.45, P = .16) and 60° ( t19 = 1.17, P = .86) of abduction.
CONCLUSIONS:   The observed differences in AHD at 0° and 90° of shoulder abduction were small and did not exceed the established minimal detectable change for either angle. Our findings suggest that active scapular retraction during shoulder abduction has a minimal influence on AHD at 0° and 90° in healthy individuals. Further investigations are needed to determine whether scapular retraction influences AHD in individuals with subacromial impingement.

N2  - Scapular kinematics during sports performances can be recorded using skin-mounted trackers attached to the skin overlying the acromion for continuous data collection without restricting natural motions of the subject relative to medical imaging analyses limiting its use for wide-range or high-speed motions. This study aimed to describe the existence of a directional bias in the translational and rotational errors of skin-mounted trackers using a 3D magnetic resonance imaging (3D-MRI) protocol. 3D-MRI scans of the healthy right shoulders of 19 males were acquired in 12 arm positions. The relative transformation of the scapular configuration determined to be the measurement error, as recorded by the configuration of the small cuboid imitating a skin-mounted tracker relative to the actual scapular configuration measured by the voxel-based registration. These measurement errors were expressed with either positive or negative values to describe the bias. Overall translational errors in the lateral, anterior, and superior directions were 3.7 ± 8.4 mm, 9.5 ± 6.4 mm, and 6.2 ± 4.6 mm, respectively. Overall rotational errors in protraction, upward rotation, and posterior tilt were 7.8 ± 8.4°, 0.2 ± 7.4°, and − 4.0 ± 7.5°, respectively. The skin-mounted tracker displayed a high probability of displacement in antero-superior (93% and 91%) directions and rotates in a protracting manner (82%) relative to the position of the underlying bone with the gradual nature of its change. The existence of the directional bias with its gradual change suggests a statistical predictability in measurement errors, which can be used to predict accurate scapular translation and rotation.

N2  - Purpose: Rockwood classified acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries by displacement of the joint on radiographs. This classification has driven the management dogma of acute AC dislocation. The correlation between Rockwood grade and symptoms has not been described in acute injury. This study assesses that relationship. Methods: This series included 77 patients with acute AC joint injury (<6 weeks), treated between 2006 and 2015. Objective and patient-reported measures enabled correlation between clinical measures and Rockwood grade. Results: The mean age was 32 years (±11.86; range 17–59 years); 88% were male. Forty-four per cent were professional athletes and 43% suffered injury during rugby. The mean time from injury to presentation was 2 weeks (±1.64; range 0–5 weeks). There was poor correlation between Rockwood classification and pain (visual analogue scale) (rs = 0.05; p = 0.752). Poor correlation was noted between Rockwood grade and functional deficit (elevation (rs = 0.18; p = 0.275), abduction (rs = 0.19; p = 0.246) and strength (rs = 0.09; p = 0.579) vs. contralateral side). Oxford and Constant scores did not correlate with Rockwood grade (rs = 0.13; p = 0.972 and 0.01; p = 0.448, respectively). Conclusion: The Rockwood grade does not correlate with clinical symptoms in acute AC joint injury. Previous evidence demonstrates the Rockwood classification’s limitations in predicting the structures injured. Therefore, the reliability of using the Rockwood grade as a decision-making tool in the management of acute AC joint dislocation is unclear.

N2  - Model-based tracking, using CT and biplane fluoroscopy, allows highly accurate quantification of glenohumeral motion and changes in the subacromial space. Previous investigators have used custom-built biplane fluoroscopes designed specifically for kinematic applications, which are available at few institutions and require FDA approval prior to clinical use. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the utility of an off-the-shelf clinical biplane fluoroscope for kinematic applications by validating model-based tracking for measurement of glenohumeral motion using an unmodified clinical system. Biplane images of each shoulder of a cadaver torso were acquired at various joint positions and during simulated movements along anatomical planes of motion. The pose of each humerus and scapula was determined using model-based tracking and compared to a bead-based gold standard. Error due to a temporal-offset between corresponding biplane images, characteristic of clinical biplane systems, was determined by comparison of measured and known relative position of 2 bead clusters of a phantom that was imaged while moved throughout the fluoroscopy image volume. Model-based tracking had global kinematic mean absolute errors of 0.27 mm and 0.29° (static), and 0.22–0.32 mm and 0.12–0.45° (dynamic). Glenohumeral mean absolute errors were 0.39 mm and 0.45° (static), and 0.36–0.42 mm and 0.41–0.48° (dynamic). The temporal-offset was predicted to add errors of 0.06–0.85 mm and 0.05–0.28° for cadaveric trials for the speeds examined. For defined speeds, sub-millimeter and sub-degree kinematic accuracy and precision were achieved using an unmodified clinical biplane fluoroscope for quantification of glenohumeral motion.

N2  - RATIONALE: While upper back pain in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) suggests that postural dysfunction is a potential cause, the extent of postural deviation in COPD is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study compared postural measurements in people with COPD to healthy controls and explored the relationship between posture deviations and pain in COPD. METHODS: Participants with COPD and age, gender, BMI and comorbidity-matched healthy controls. Participants underwent a postural geometric measurement in upright standing. 3-D motion analysis generated the coordinates of skeletal structures from anatomical landmarks. Participants with COPD completed questionnaires related to pain. Postural stability measures of center of pressure in the anteroposterior (A/P) and mediolateral (M/L) directions, spinal alignment, thoracic kyphosis, scapula and sternal orientation were completed. RESULTS: Twenty-one participants with COPD and 21 matched controls completed the study. The method of postural stability and alignment demonstrated excellent reliability in both groups (all ICC > 0.75). Those with COPD had a trend towards a greater center of pressure M/L sway compared to controls (mean 4.3 cm vs 2.9 cm), with no difference in center of pressure A/P sway. Thoracic kyphosis was greater in COPD (51.8° vs 39.1°, p = 0.001), but there was no difference in spinal alignment (p > 0.05). Those with COPD had an increase in left (p = 0.003) and right (p = 0.002) scapula protraction. Increased thoracic kyphosis and altered scapula position were unrelated to back pain in COPD (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Postural deviations are evident in COPD, but the small number of those with pain limited analysis of the association between postural deviations and pain.

N2  - Background: Neck pain is a common musculoskeletal complaint in computer users due to prolonged static or awkward work postures. It has been shown that pathogenesis of neck pain is associated with scapular movement impairment syndromes. However, there is a dearth of literature in treatment based on these syndromes. Aim: To identify the effects of movement impairment-based treatment in the management of mechanical neck pain, in computer users. Methods: In the present study, twenty-seven subjects were recruited. Based on the identified scapular impairment syndrome, they were trained with scapular movement impairment-based exercises for four weeks. Pain, disability and cervical range of motion were measured with numeric pain rating scale, neck disability index and inclinometer, respectively, at baseline and at four weeks. Results: Twenty-one subjects completed the study. After four weeks, a significant difference of 4.81 points for numeric pain rating scale and 24.47% for neck disability index at 95% CI were found. The cervical range of motion showed a significant change (p < 0.05) of 10.09° for flexion, 24.47° for extension, 7.42° for right lateral flexion, 6.23° for left lateral flexion, 15.52° for right rotation and 14.95° for left rotation at 95% CI. Conclusions: Exercises based on scapular impairment syndromes were given for four weeks. It was found to be effective in relieving pain and reducing dysfunction in computer users with mechanical neck pain

N2  - Background: Revision of unstable reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) remains a significant challenge. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of a new treatment-guiding classification for instability after RSA, to describe the clinical outcomes of patients stabilized operatively, and to identify those with higher risk of recurrence. Methods: All patients undergoing revision for instability after RSA were identified at our institution. Demographic, clinical, radiographic, and intraoperative data were collected. A classification was developed using all identified causes of instability after RSA and allocating them to 1 of 3 defined treatment-guiding categories. Eight surgeons reviewed all data and applied the classification scheme to each case. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability was used to evaluate the classification scheme. Preoperative clinical outcomes were compared with final follow-up in stabilized shoulders. Results: Forty-three revision cases in 34 patients met the inclusion for study. Five patients remained unstable after revision. Persistent instability most commonly occurred in persistent deltoid dysfunction and postoperative acromial fractures but also in 1 case of soft tissue impingement. Twenty-one patients remained stable at minimum 2 years of follow-up and had significant improvement of clinical outcome scores and range of motion. Reliability of the classification scheme showed substantial and almost perfect interobserver and intraobserver agreement among all the participants (κ = 0.699 and κ = 0.851, respectively). Discussion: Instability after RSA can be successfully treated with revision surgery using the reliable treatment-guiding classification scheme presented herein. However, more understanding is needed for patients with greater risk of recurrent instability after revision surgery.

N2  - Background: An increasing number of parameters measured on anteroposterior radiographs are used for the evaluation of the bony geometry of the scapula. Inhomogeneous acquisition of images is common because of the lack of standardization in radiographic positioning. Images with malrotation around the horizontal axis of the scapula are particularly frequent. We hypothesized that malrotated images would result in large variations in measured radiographic parameters and that image standardization using qualitative and semiquantitative “omometric” criteria would decrease these variations in measurements. “Omometry” is a newly introduced umbrella term that contains all standardized measurements on plain radiographs of the shoulder, analogous to the term “coxometry,” which is widely used for the radiographic assessment of the osseous pelvis and hip. Methods: In this experimental, cadaveric radiographic study, 7 dry-bone human scapula cadaveric specimens from anonymous donors were used to obtain 210 radiographs. We incrementally rotated (steps of 3°) every scapula around its horizontal and vertical axis, with a total range of 42° per each axis. Then, we measured 5 radiographic parameters on every image and observed their change with malrotation. Furthermore, we introduced 4 omometric criteria defining an appropriate (presence of ≥3 criteria) radiographic image to improve standardization of scapular image acquisition. Results: Overall, measured values remained stable within a narrow range of ±9° of malrotation. Beyond this range, values of all parameters significantly deviated (>±2°) from the initial value. Measurements on appropriate images were significantly less prone to deviation. Within the appropriate images, those with 4 criteria showed a higher specificity than those with 3 criteria. Conclusion: There is significant variation in values of measured radiographic parameters on anteroposterior radiographs of the scapula with substantially malrotated images. With the use of the 4 newly introduced semiquantitative and qualitative omometric criteria, which define an appropriate image, reliability of the measured parameters can be significantly improved.

N2  - Muscle synergies have been used for decades to explain a variety of motor behaviors, both in humans and animals and, more recently, to steer rehabilitation strategies. However, many sources of variability such as factorization algorithms, criteria for dimensionality reduction and data pre-processing constitute a major obstacle to the successful comparison of the results obtained by different research groups. Starting from the canonical EMG processing we determined how variations in filter cut-off frequencies and normalization methods, commonly found in literature, affect synergy weights and inter-subject similarity (ISS) using experimental data related to a 15-muscles upper-limb reaching task. Synergy weights were not significantly altered by either normalization (maximum voluntary contraction - MVC - or maximum amplitude of the signal - SELF) or band-pass filter ([20-500 Hz] or [50-500] Hz). Normalization did, however, alter the amount of variance explained by a set of synergies, which is a criterion often used for model order selection. Comparing different low-pass (LP) filters (0.5 Hz, 4 Hz, 10 Hz, 20 Hz cut-offs) we showed that increasing the low pass filter cut-off had the effect of decreasing the variance accounted for by a set number of synergies and affected individual muscle contributions. Extreme smoothing (i.e., LP cut-off 0.5 Hz) enhanced the contrast between active and inactive muscles but had an unpredictable effect on the ISS. The results presented here constitute a further step towards a thoughtful EMG pre-processing for the extraction of muscle synergies.

N2  - Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty (RSA) has gained popularity over the recent years, but impingement concerns are still present. Surgeons aim to correct pre-operative glenoid deformities to reduce impingement but it can be challenging without assistance like patient specific guides. However, it is unclear how accurate glenoid correction affects the impingement. The main objective of this study was to determine whether accurate glenoid correction to neutral version and tilt can reduce the risk of impingement. Two types of virtual surgeries were performed on 22 pre-operative arthritic shoulders: (i) “Interactive,” the glenoid baseplate could be placed with accuracy, and (ii) “Blind,” surgeons placed the RSA baseplate while they could only visualize the glenoid. The virtual models were then used in an RSA biomechanical model which recorded impingement for (i) four Range of Motion (ROM) tasks, (ii) ten Activities of Daily Living (ADL). The “Blind” method resulted in more variable glenoid placement (version and tilt) than the “Interactive” method (p = 0.001). However, both methods showed similar ROM and impingement occurrence in ADLs. The results suggest it is challenging for surgeons to accurately correct version and tilt on arthritic glenoids when only referencing off of the face of the glenoid. However, the variable glenosphere placement observed in the “Blind” method did not result in worse impingement compared to the accurate “Interactive” method. This was because both methods had similar inferior baseplate positioning which is more important than correcting version or tilt. Implantation accuracy remains important in RSA, but pre-operative planning should not just target at correcting version and tilt. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

N2  - Theater performers, more than common actors, experience high physical loadings. This study aimed at analyzing the motor behavior of novice performers (dancers/actors who were introduced to the acting method of Jan Fabre) by investigating the kinematics of a physical acting exercise in a prospective study. Two measurement sessions were organized: Before and after the novice performers (N = 13) took part in seven workshops. Total body kinematics were registered using a three-dimensional motion capture system. Using a principal component analysis, six factors were disseminated out of 30 kinematic parameters: Pelvic Motion, Speed of Progression, Lower Limb Position, Foot Motion, Lower Limb Motion, and Trunk Posture. Although no main effect of training was found for any of the factors (.429 < p < .964), Trunk Posture showed a higher consistency after the workshops. This study succeeded in providing insights in the motor behavior of theater performers and revealed recognizable features of motor learning.

N2  - An irreparable anterosuperior massive rotator cuff tear with an irreparable subscapularis tear is not common; however, once symptomatic, it would become a challenging situation. Tendon transfer is a choice and the pectoralis major is a commonly selected graft source. However, there are theoretical concerns over its use: high invasiveness and low reproducibility, different force vector from the subscapularis, unsuitability for the arthroscopic modification, and difficulty in conversion to the reverse shoulder arthroplasty due to adhesions and scar formation in the anterior shoulder. Recently, open pectoralis minor transfer has been advocated as an alternative reconstruction option. We describe an arthroscopic-assisted technique of pectoralis minor transfer for irreparable anterosuperior massive rotator cuff tear.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate whether arthroscopic lateral acromioplasty reliably decreases the critical shoulder angle (CSA) and whether it is associated with damage to the deltoid or other complications. Methods: Patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) with lateral but without anterior acromioplasty for degenerative, full-thickness rotator cuff tears and a CSA of 34° or greater were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with traumatic or irreparable rotator cuff tears, osteoarthritis, or previous surgery were excluded. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were assessed at a minimum of 12 months’ follow-up. Results: We reviewed 49 consecutive patients (mean age, 56 years; age range, 39-76 years) at a mean of 30 months (range, 12-47 months). There were 7 RCR failures (14%). The mean CSA was reduced from 37.5° preoperatively (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.7°-38.3°) to 33.9° postoperatively (95% CI, 33.3°-34.6°; P <.001). There were no cases of dehiscence, increases in fatty infiltration, or significant atrophy of the deltoid. Scarring at the deltoid origin was noted in 18 patients (37%). The mean absolute and relative Constant scores increased from 59 points (95% CI, 54-64 points) to 74 points (95% CI, 70-78 points) and from 66% (95% CI, 61%-71%) to 83% (95% CI, 79%-87%) respectively, and the Subjective Shoulder Value increased from 45% (95% CI, 39%-50%) to 80% (95% CI, 74%-86%) (P <.001 for all 3 improvements). The postoperative CSA was significantly larger in failed than in healed repairs (P =.026). Patients with a healed RCR and a CSA corrected to 33° or less (n = 22) had 25% more abduction strength than patients with a healed cuff and a CSA corrected to 35° or greater (n = 14, P =.04). Conclusions: Arthroscopic lateral acromioplasty performed in addition to arthroscopic RCR can reduce the CSA without significantly compromising the deltoid origin, deltoid muscle, or function. It is not associated with any additional complications of arthroscopic RCR. Insufficiently corrected, abnormally large CSAs are associated either with a higher retear rate or with inferior strength of abduction if the tears heal. Level of Evidence: Level IV, case series, treatment study.

N2  - Background: It is believed that both patient and surgeon factors contribute to premature implant loosening. This video study was designed to answer the following questions: Can orthopedic surgeons reliably differentiate between procedures done well and those that will lead to early glenoid failure? Do the difficulty of the operation and the surgeon's performance predict a patient's outcome? Does the presence of a Walch B2 glenoid result in surgery that is evidently more difficult and performed in such a way to suggest early glenoid component failure? Methods: Eleven upper extremity surgeons blindly graded a set of intraoperative videos of 15 total shoulder arthroplasty patients (grouped by outcome at 2 years). Evaluation questionnaires consisted of questions about the perceived difficulty and the surgeon's performance. Total and partial patient scores were calculated for each video. Higher calculated score would indicate worse postsurgical outcome. Results: The loosening group had a significantly higher total score (P =.0057). Also, patients with B2 glenoids scored significantly higher than patients with other wear type. The analysis of overall procedure performance indicated difference between outcome groups (P =.0063). Conclusion: Our results indicate that surgeons could review surgical videos and differentiate the cases that were difficult or those that were more likely to lead to loosening of the glenoid component. The presence of a B2 glenoid was predictive of difficult surgery. The results of this study should serve as a starting point for surgeons interested in critically evaluating performance and also for those interested in finding ways to maximize patient outcomes after total shoulder arthroplasty.

N2  - For kinematic studies of the shoulder, electromagnetic sensors are commonly placed on the humerus, scapula, and trunk. The trunk sensor is used to describe humeral and scapular kinematics with respect to the trunk. There are two common trunk sensor placements, the sternum or third thoracic vertebrae (T3). It is currently unclear if placement of the trunk sensor affects kinematics, making it difficult to compare data across studies. The purpose of this study was to compare two trunk sensor placements (T3 and sternum) on trunk and scapular kinematics during arm elevation. An electromagnetic tracking system was used to collect kinematic data during five consecutive repetitions of ascending and descending arm elevation in the sagittal plane. The results indicate that trunk sensor placement had no significant effect on trunk kinematics or scapular upward/downward rotation and internal/external rotation. Scapular anterior/posterior tilt was significantly greater when the trunk sensor was on the sternum compared to the T3 vertebrae during ascending 30°–120°: mean difference = −3.51° (95%CI: −5.61, −1.40), and descending 120°–30°: mean difference = −3.27° (95%CI: −6.07, −0.48). However, the difference in anterior/posterior tilt did not exceed the error (minimal detectable change), and thus is likely not a meaningful difference. These results indicate the trunk sensors can be affixed on T3 or the sternum, depending on the needs of the study.

N2  - Fluoroscopy and 2D/3D shape-matching has emerged as the standard for non-invasively quantifying kinematics. However, its accuracy has not been well established for the shoulder complex when using single-plane fluoroscopy. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of single-plane fluoroscopy and 2D/3D shape-matching for quantifying full shoulder complex kinematics. Tantalum markers were implanted into the clavicle, humerus, and scapula of four cadaveric shoulders. Biplane radiographs were obtained with the shoulder in five humerothoracic elevation positions (arm at the side, 30°, 60°, 90°, maximum). Images from both systems were used to perform marker tracking, while only those images acquired with the primary fluoroscopy system were used to perform 2D/3D shape-matching. Kinematics errors due to shape-matching were calculated as the difference between marker tracking and 2D/3D shape-matching and expressed as root mean square (RMS) error, bias, and precision. Overall RMS errors for the glenohumeral joint ranged from 0.7 to 3.3° and 1.2 to 4.2 mm, while errors for the acromioclavicular joint ranged from 1.7 to 3.4°. Errors associated with shape-matching individual bones ranged from 1.2 to 3.2° for the humerus, 0.5 to 1.6° for the scapula, and 0.4 to 3.7° for the clavicle. The results of the study demonstrate that single-plane fluoroscopy and 2D/3D shape-matching can accurately quantify full shoulder complex kinematics in static positions.

N2  - Objectives To compare serratus anterior and lower trapezius muscle thickness between swimmers with and without current shoulder pain, and between sides when measured by real-time ultrasound imaging. Design A single blinded age and gender-matched case-control study with 26 symptomatic and 26 asymptomatic recreational swimmers. Methods Muscle thickness of serratus anterior and lower trapezius were measured using previously validated real-time ultrasound imaging protocols. Serratus anterior thickness was measured in side lying with 90° of glenohumeral flexion at rest and during a scapular protraction contraction. Lower trapezius thickness was measured in prone with 145° of glenohumeral abduction whilst at rest and when holding the weight of the arm. Results There was no statistically significant difference between the muscle thickness of serratus anterior and lower trapezius between the symptomatic shoulder and the dominance-matched shoulder in the asymptomatic group of swimmers. There was also no significant difference in muscle thickness between the symptomatic side and asymptomatic side within the symptomatic group. Conclusions There appears to be no difference in serratus anterior and lower trapezius thickness between swimmers who have mild to moderate shoulder pain, who continue to swim and those who do not have shoulder pain. When imaging the serratus anterior and lower trapezius in swimmers with mild shoulder pain, clinicians should expect no differences between sides. If muscle thickness differences between sides are detected in recreational swimmers, this may indicate that the swimmer is participating in other asymmetrical activities or has a higher level of shoulder pain.

N2  - Symptomatic scapulothoracic disorders, including scapulothoracic crepitus and scapulothoracic bursitis are uncommon disorders involving the scapulothoracic articulation that have the potential to cause significant patient morbidity. Scapulothoracic crepitus is the presence of a grinding or popping sound with movement of the scapula that may or may not be symptomatic, while scapulothoracic bursitis refers to inflammation of bursa within the scapulothoracic articulation. Both entities may occur either concomitantly or independently. Nonetheless, the constellation of symptoms manifested by both entities has been referred to as the snapping scapula syndrome. Various causes of scapulothoracic crepitus include bursitis, variable scapular morphology, post-surgical or post-traumatic changes, osseous and soft tissue masses, scapular dyskinesis, and postural defects. Imaging is an important adjunct to the physical examination for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment management. Non-operative management such as physical therapy and local injection can be effective for symptoms secondary to scapular dyskinesis or benign, non-osseous lesions. Surgical treatment is utilized for osseous lesions, or if non-operative management for bursitis has failed. Open, arthroscopic, or combined methods have been performed with good clinical outcomes.

N2  - Adult brachial plexus injuries frequently lead to significant and permanent physical disabilities. Investigating the mechanism of the injury using biomechanical approaches may lead to further knowledge with regard to preventing brachial plexus injuries. However, there are no reports of biomechanical studies of brachial plexus injuries till date. Therefore, the present study used a complex three-dimensional finite element model (3D-FEM) of the brachial plexus to analyze the mechanism of brachial plexus injury and to assess the validity of the model. A complex 3D-FEM of the spinal column, dura mater, spinal nerve root, brachial plexus, rib bone and cartilage, clavicle, scapula, and humerus were conducted. Stress was applied to the model based on the mechanisms of clinically reported brachial plexus injuries: Retroflexion of the cervical, lateroflexion of the cervical, rotation of the cervical, and abduction of the upper limb. The present study analyzed the distribution and strength of strain applied to the brachial plexus during each motion. When the cervical was retroflexed or lateroflexed, the strain was focused on the C5 nerve root and the upper trunk of the brachial plexus. When the upper limb was abducted, strain was focused on the C7 and C8 nerve roots and the lower trunk of the brachial plexus. The results of brachial plexus injury mechanism corresponded with clinical findings that demonstrated the validity of this model. The results of the present study hypothesized that the model has a future potential for analyzing pathological conditions of brachial plexus injuries and other injuries or diseases, including that of spine and spinal nerve root.

N2  - Background: Implantation of the glenoid component of a total shoulder prosthesis can be facilitated by using a patient-specific guide (PSG) designed to ensure replication of the preoperatively planned position. The objective of this study was to assess the reliability and accuracy of a PSG in replicating the planned glenoid component position during total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). Hypothesis: Additional criteria should be used for 3D preoperative planning and PSG design to further improve the accuracy of glenoid component positioning. Material and methods: We studied 10 patients who underwent TSA with use of a PSG to position the glenoid component after preoperative 3D planning. Postoperative glenoid version and tilt were measured and compared to the planned values. We also used new criteria to assess implant rotation and global 3D position, as well as accuracy of the 3D pilot hole for the glenoid guide-pin. Results: Mean errors in glenoid position were −1.7° ± 4.4° for version, −0.4° ± 4.9° for tilt, and 6.0° ± 13.5° for rotation. Mean difference in global orientation of the glenoid implant versus the planned value was 4.9° ± 2.5°. Mean 3D discrepancy in glenoid pilot hole position was 2.9 ± 0.5 mm; the discrepancy was greater in the mediolateral direction (1.9 ± 0.9 mm) than in the supero-inferior (1.1 ± 1.2 mm) and antero-posterior (0.8 ± 1.2 mm) directions. Discussion: The poor performance of the PSG in controlling rotation and reaming may explain the difference in global glenoid position compared to the planned value. Improvements in PSG design to incorporate these two parameters deserve consideration. Level of evidence: II, prospective cohort study.

N2  - Background: In case of people suffering from chronic low back pain, specific movements of the hip, pelvis, and trunk are associated with pain. Comparing range of motion measurements for multiple planes and from different segments and lines in reference to those of healthy individuals seems interesting but present interpretations challenge in relation to important number of variables and correlation with clinical data. Methods: The proposed index is based on using principal component analysis to quantify differences in trunk mobility between patients with chronic low back pain and a control group. Kinematic data were recorded for the cervical and thoracic vertebrae, the lumbar spine, and the pelvic and scapular belts during repeated trials (hip flexion and extension, hip bending, and trunk twists). Angular motion values were calculated. Principal component analysis was used to convert 10 discrete variables (kinematical data) extracted from control data into 10 independent variables. Findings: The proposed index comprises the sum of the variables. Initial demonstration of its clinical utility and statistical tests of this index validity were revealed. It establishes correlations between the psychosocial impact of chronic low back pain, trunk mobility (as summarized by the index) and the positive effects of functional restoration program. Interpretation: This index let to assess the absolute potential benefits of rehabilitation in term of kinematic motion. Functional restoration program promotes the physical functioning of patients by increasing their range of motion. This index uses kinematic motion to assess the potential benefits of such rehabilitation program.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess concurrent validity, between and within-day reliability of scapular and clavicular digital inclinometer measures.
DESIGN: Test-retest and concurrent validity.
SETTING: Laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three participants with and without shoulder symptoms.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Static positions of scapular upward rotation, anterior/posterior tilting and clavicular elevation were measured between days with an inclinometer and compared to a 3-dimensional electromagnetic tracking system in different positions of sagittal plane humeral elevation (neutral, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°). The two methods were compared using a two-way Analysis of Variance. Linear regressions at each arm position were also performed to further assess concurrent validity.
RESULTS: Between-day reliability demonstrated Intraclass Correlation Coefficients ≥ 0.50 for all comparisons. There were statistically significant differences between methods or interactions of method and arm position for clavicle elevation (p = 0.004, maximum offset between methods 7.7º in the neutral position), and scapular upward rotation (p = 0.001). For scapular upward rotation, the maximum difference between methods was less than 2° across all humeral positions. Clavicle elevation (r = 0.67-0.82) and scapular upward rotation (r = 0.57-0.81) demonstrated higher correlations between measurement methods than scapular anterior/posterior tilt (r = 0.10-0.67).
CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent validity in assessing scapular upward rotation and clavicle elevation with an inclinometer was shown when compared with electromagnetic tracking. However, the inclinometer method may not have adequate concurrent validity to clinically measure scapular anterior/posterior tilting.

N2  - Background: Overhead athletes are at a greater risk of developing scapular dyskinesis (SD). Although swimming is considered an overhead sport, information regarding SD in these athletes is scarce. Purpose: To determine the prevalence of SD in young, asymptomatic elite swimmers. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 661 asymptomatic elite swimmers were enrolled in this study (344 male, 317 female; mean age, 15.83 ± 2.20 years). Anthropometric characteristics, training routine, and stroke specialty were recorded. SD was assessed using a dynamic test consisting of an examination of the shoulder blades throughout synchronous forward flexion motion in the sagittal plane and was deemed to be either present or absent. Each movement was repeated 5 times. These evaluations were performed with athletes at rest, before any training or competition. Statistical analysis was performed. Results: SD was detected in 56 (8.5%) participants. Type I SD was the most common (46.5%); male participants were 2 times as likely to have SD as female participants (39 male, 17 female; P <.01). No correlation was found between the dominant limb and side affected (P =.258); rather, a correlation was found between the breathing side and side affected, in that swimmers with a preferred breathing side were more prone to develop SD in the opposite shoulder (P <.05). Swimmers involved in long-distance races were found to have a greater risk of developing SD (P =.01). Conclusion: SD may be an asymptomatic condition in elite young swimmers and is present in 8.5% of these athletes. Early diagnosis may be useful for asymptomatic athletes with SD and to avoid its possible evolution to a symptomatic condition.

N2  - Background: Technological tools as robotic devices and wearable sensors can provide accurate and repeatable measurements of physical variables (e.g., position, velocities, forces) which can be used for quantitative and qualitative assessment of movement analysis and upper limb motor performance. Objective: The study aims to propose a quantitative and qualitative assessment of upper limb motor performance by means of seven kinematic parameters recorded by a passive mechatronic device in patients who underwent a surgical procedure for ligament reconstruction following acromioclavicular joint dislocation. Method: Five patients (mean age: 40 ± 12 years) with acromioclavicular joint dislocation were enrolled. A passive end-effector mechatronic device characterized by 7 degrees of freedom and designed for the assessment of upper limb motor performance-especially for measuring the hand position in three-dimensional space-was used. The Constant-Murley score and seven kinematic parameters were used as clinical outcome measure and quantitative and qualitative assessment, respectively. Results: The preliminary results of this study show no significant differences between the impaired arm and unimpaired arm: the end-effector passive mechatronic device used in this study is able to provide an overall assessment of the upper limb motor performance following shoulder impairment. Conclusion: The motion tracker can be easily used as effective tool for quantitative and qualitative assessment of upper limb motor performance, even several years after the surgical operation.

N2  - Objective. The study used a 3D digitizer to determine three-dimensional motion analysis of the 2nd cervical (C2) spinous process at end range cervical rotation with the scapula in different positions. Methods. 30 healthy adults participated in this study. Different scapula positions were adopted bilaterally and positioned passively at normal resting, depression, adduction, and abduction. Under each scapula position, bilateral end range cervical rotation and displacement of the C2 spinous process were analyzed by a 3D digitizer. Results. Displacement of the C2 spinous process relative to the occiput was significantly correlated with range of cervical rotation under all scapular positions (p<0.05). However, there were no significant differences between end range cervical rotation and displacement of the C2 spinous process relative to the occiput in any scapular position. Conclusion. These results suggest that measurement of upper cervical mobility using the 3D digitizer is a reliable method that holds promise in the evaluation of people with cervical spine disorders.

N2  - Background: Allograft-prosthetic composite (APC) reconstruction of the humerus represents an appealing surgical technique when implantation of a reverse prosthesis is considered in the setting of substantial proximal humeral bone loss1-4. Humeral APCs have been successfully performed in the past with a non-reverse shoulder prosthesis4,5. Reconstruction of the proximal part of the humerus with an allograft provides adequate support and fixation for the humeral component, allows restoration of length and lateral offset, and provides an opportunity for soft-tissue reattachment when needed.Onthe basis of the available peer-reviewed data, healing at the allograft-host junction is reliable, and complication rates, including instability, are relatively low3,6. Description: Once the glenoid reverse component has been implanted, a proximal humeral allograft is prepared to receive the humeral component of a reverse arthroplasty. The allograft is procured by our institutional bone and tissue bank, purchased from a number of vendors. The graft is selected after review of the description and radiographs provided by the vendor. The priority is to obtain a graft with sufficient length and soft tissues attached. If possible, the graft selected should have a diameter close to the diameter of the humerus of the recipient. The desired allograft length is selected on the basis of preoperative planning and intraoperative measurements, and the distal portion of the allograft is resected accordingly. Depending on the length of the defect, host bone quality, and surgeon preferences, the humeral component may or may not bypass the host-graft junction. The stem bypasses the host-graft junction for shorter APCs, as well as when the bone quality of the native humerus is compromised. Cemented fixation into the graft is universally used. Compression plating is used for graft-to-host fixation, supplemented by implantation of the stem across the junction in selected cases. Care is taken during the freehand cut to obtain optimal contact and compression. Once the ideal humeral bearing thickness has been selected, the polyethylene bearing is implanted and the joint relocated. If the posterior cuff can be repaired to cuff allograft, sutures are placed prior to relocation and are tied after relocation. Other musculotendinous units, such as the deltoid or pectoralis major, are repaired to the allograft if needed. Alternatives: Implantation of a reverse prosthesis with a proximal humeral metal body (a so-called tumor prosthesis) is the main alternative to proximal humeral APC reconstruction. In patients with shorter defects, adequate soft-tissue tension may be obtained by implanting a glenosphere with a large inferior eccentricity and cementing the humeral component in a more proximal position than is usually performed. Alternatively, when implantation of the glenoid component of a reverse prosthesis is not possible, a hemiarthroplasty-APCconstructmay be performed1,4,5,7-10, addinga synthetic sleeve such as an aortic Dacron graft to enhance soft-tissue stability if needed. Rationale: When reverse arthroplasty is performed in the setting of substantial humeral bone loss, the humeral componentmay be poorly supported and at risk for loosening. In addition, the absence of proximal humeral bone stockmay lead to shortening and/or loss of lateral offset. Finally, the posterosuperior cuff, subscapularis, deltoid, and pectoralis tendons mayremaindetached.The potential consequences ofhumeralbone loss inthe settingof reverse arthroplasty includehumeral loosening, dislocation, and poor active motion (particularly poor active elevation). Allograft reconstruction of the proximal part of the humerus provides an opportunity for better support of the component, restoration of humeral length and lateral offset, and attachment sites for the musculotendinous structures around the shoulder, if needed.

N2  - Learning Objectives: Understand the value of recognizing subtle but definite X-Ray findings in MSK trauma Appreciate the best sources and approach for more detailed knowledge in MSK trauma Main: There are many possible sources of misdiagnosis in medical imaging. Several are related to perception; some are simply the result of poor communication. This presentation discusses another aspect of the reporting process – where lack of specific knowledge or a failure to appreciate the clinical value of early diagnosis can lead to under-reporting of signs even on simple plain X-ray radiographic examination. This will be illustrated with some cases and background information related to some common traumatic clinical problems in the upper limb: glenohumeral dislocations; elbow posterolateral dislocations and injuries at the wrist, specifically the scaphoid fracture. In the shoulder joint anteroinferior dislocations are common and usually well recognised clinically. The pathoanatomy of the dislocated shoulder is often best demonstrated by MR but it is not uncommon to have clear evidence of significant humeral or glenoid bony defects on the initial X-ray examination. Routine ED X-rays often included simply an AP and lateral oblique (“scapular Y”) views. The value of the AP oblique and the AP internally rotated view is underrated. Similarly some fairly simple and easily reproducible views such as the angled axial Garth view can clarify on X-ray what is later demonstrated by CT scan or MR. The value to the clinician of early demonstration of such bony changes is to be highlighted, particularly in the recurrently dislocated glenohumeral joint. Glenoid tracking and the mismatch of humeral and glenoid defects from an episode of dislocation is to be further discussed. Posterior dislocations of the glenohumeral joint are much less common and in contradistinction to the anterior dislocation are frequently a difficult clinical diagnosis. The value of the AP oblique and axial views in clarifying this on X-Ray will be further illustrated as will some frequently under-reported signs on X-ray. The bony articulations of the elbow are complex with angulations which facilitate the various movements of those joints. The well positioned lateral view is very useful in assessing the elbow joint but it is not always achieved in the acute trauma setting. The stepwise progression of the common posterolateral instability and dislocation produces a series of bony injuries which largely correspond to ligamentous avulsions and bony shear injuries. The fracture of the radial head is often appreciated but the bony avulsions are often overlooked on X-ray or even on CT scan, if performed. The coronoid process fracture is sometimes subtle but usually present. In half of the cases of medial epicondyle avulsion there is an associated dislocation and entrapment can ensue. The bones and articulations of the hand and wrist are multiplanar and complicated. Multiple radiographic views may be needed to optimally demonstrate bony injuries. This is particularly the case with the almost undisplaced scaphoid waist fracture. The well-known late complications of an untreated scaphoid fracture have influenced the use of sometimes significantly delayed exclusion of this diagnosis. Even though targeted radiography is essential the possibility of a false negative diagnosis has led to a tendency keep the undiagnosed wrist immobilised for much longer times than needed. Good clinical assessment and earlier progression to MR in such cases is not yet universal. These issues will be further discussed. In short, there are many missed opportunities for radiologists to make an early diagnosis even before advanced cross sectional imaging is ordered. On the other hand there are many situations where expert radiological opinion can influence the clinical team more effectively and more directly to advanced cross sectional techniques.

N2  - Background Previous studies have proposed various ways to assess scapular dyskinesis. In clinic, assessment tools designed to measure the posterior displacement of the inferior angle of the scapula with reference to the posterior thoracic cage are needed. Objectives A novel scapulometer was developed to measure scapular medial border and inferior angle prominence. Methods A novel scapulometer was designed to measure the distance from the root of the spine (ROS) and the inferior angle (INF) of the scapula to the thorax wall in 29 participants with scapular dyskinesis bilaterally. Two raters measured the ROS and INF distance of the scapula 3 times bilaterally. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM) were calculated to determine the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. Validity was based on correlations (convergent: ROS and internal/external rotation, and INF and tilt; divergent: ROS/INF and upward rotation of the scapula) using a FASTRAK Polhemus 3-D motion tracking system assessing scapular tilt, internal/external rotation, and upward/downward rotation. Results The average ROS and INF displacements were 13.7 ± 5.0 mm and 12.5 ± 6.3 mm, respectively. The results showed excellent intra-rater and inter-rater reliability, with ICC = 0.88–0.99 and 0.95–0.99 (SEM = 0.7–0.8 mm), respectively. Correlations were 0.35/0.19 (convergent validity) and 0.07/0.09 (divergent validity). Conclusions The novel scapulometer has excellent reliability and fair validity to quantify medial border and inferior angle prominence of the scapula. Further research utilizing this instrument is recommended.

N2  - Altered scapular motions premeditate shoulder impingement and other musculoskeletal disorders. Divergent experimental conditions in previous research precludes rigorous comparisons of non-invasive scapular tracking techniques. This study evaluated scapular orientation measurement methods across an expanded range of humeral postures. Scapular medial/lateral rotation, anterior/posterior tilt and protraction/retraction was measured using an acromion marker cluster (AMC), a scapular locator, and a reference stylus. Motion was captured using reflective markers on the upper body, as well as on the AMC, locator and stylus. A combination of 5 arm elevation angles, 3 arm elevation planes and 3 arm axial rotations was examined. Measurement method interacted with elevation angle and plane of elevation for all three scapular orientation directions (p < 0.01). Method of measurement interacted with axial rotation in anterior/posterior tilt and protraction/retraction (p < 0.01). The AMC had strong agreement with the reference stylus than the locator for the majority of humeral elevations, planes and axial rotations. The AMC underestimated lateral rotation, with the largest difference of ∼2° at 0° elevation. Both the locator and AMC overestimated posterior tilt at high arm elevation by up to 7.4°. Misestimations from using the locator could be enough to potentially obscure meaningful differences in scapular rotations.

N2  - Musculoskeletal modeling is capable of estimating physiological parameters that cannot be directly measured, however, the validity of the results must be assessed. Several models utilize a scapular rhythm to prescribe kinematics, yet it is unknown how well they replicate natural scapular motion. This study evaluated kinematic errors associated with a model that employs a scapular rhythm using 2 shoulder movements: abduction and forward reach. Two versions of the model were tested: the original MoBL ARMS model that utilizes a scapular rhythm, and a modified MoBL ARMS model that permits unconstrained scapular motion. Model estimates were compared against scapulothoracic kinematics directly measured from motion capture. Three-dimensional scapulothoracic resultant angle errors associated with the rhythm model were greater than 10° for abduction (mean: 16.4°, max: 22.4°) and forward reach (mean: 11.1°, max: 16.5°). Errors generally increased with humerothoracic elevation with all subjects reporting greater than 10° differences at elevations greater than 45°. Errors associated with the unconstrained model were less than 10°. Consequently, use of the original MoBL ARMS model is cautioned for applications requiring precise scapulothoracic kinematics. These findings can help determine which research questions are suitable for investigation with these models and assist in contextualizing model results.

N2  - The Latarjet is a successful primary and revision option for anterior shoulder instability. However, recent reports have highlighted varying complication rates. Our study prospectively collected clinical, functional and radiological outcomes of patients undergoing the procedure. Forty-eight consecutive patients (fifty shoulders) underwent the Latarjet procedure in a single UK centre. Clinical, radiological and functional follow-up was performed. Mean clinical follow-up was 32 months and radiological follow-up 20 months. 95% shoulders were subjectively graded "excellent" or "good" and 5% "fair". Mean Rowe, Oxford Shoulder Instability Score, American Shoulder and Elbow selfassessment Score and Subjective Shoulder Value Score all improved post-operatively (p<0.001). No infections, dislocations, revisions or metalworkrelated complications occurred. There was one intra-operative coracoid fracture and five transient neurological injuries, resolving within three months. The long-term complication rate was 2%. The Latarjet procedure is safe and reliable for treating anterior shoulder instability with a very low long-term complication rate providing excellent clinical and functional outcomes.

N2  - The labrum contributes to passive glenohumeral joint stability. Cadaveric studies have demonstrated that this has position and load dependency, which has not been quantified under physiological loads. This study aims to validate subject-specific finite element (FE) models against in vitro measurements of joint stability and to utilise the FE models to predict joint stability under physiological loads. The predicted stability values were within ± one standard deviation of experimental data and the FE models showed a reduction in stability of 10–15% with high, physiological, loads. The developed regression equations provide the first representation of passive glenohumeral stability and will aid surgical decision-making.

N2  - The ability to intercept or avoid a moving object, whether to catch a ball, snatch one’s prey, or avoid the path of a predator, is a skill that has been acquired throughout evolution by many species in the animal kingdom. This requires processing early visual cues in order to program anticipatory motor responses tuned to the forthcoming event. Here, we explore the nature of the early kinematics cues that could inform an observer about the future direction of a ball projected with an unconstrained overarm throw. Our goal was to pinpoint the body segments that, throughout the temporal course of the throwing action, could provide key cues for accurately predicting the side of the outgoing ball. We recorded whole-body kinematics from twenty non-expert participants performing unconstrained overarm throws at four different targets placed on a vertical plane at 6 m distance. In order to characterize the spatiotemporal structure of the information embedded in the kinematics of the throwing action about the outgoing ball direction, we introduced a novel combination of dimensionality reduction and machine learning techniques. The recorded kinematics clearly shows that throwing styles differed considerably across individuals, with corresponding inter-individual differences in the spatio-temporal structure of the thrower predictability. We found that for most participants it is possible to predict the region where the ball hit the target plane, with an accuracy above 80%, as early as 400–500 ms before ball release. Interestingly, the body parts that provided the most informative cues about the action outcome varied with the throwing style and during the time course of the throwing action. Not surprisingly, at the very end of the action, the throwing arm is the most informative body segment. However, cues allowing for predictions to be made earlier than 200 ms before release are typically associated to other body parts, such as the lower limbs and the contralateral arm. These findings are discussed in the context of the sport-science literature on throwing and catching interactive tasks, as well as from the wider perspective of the role of sensorimotor coupling in interpersonal social interactions.

N2  - Upper limb three-dimensional movement analysis (UL-3DMA) offers a reliable and valid tool to evaluate movement patterns in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP). However, it remains unknown to what extent the underlying motor impairments explain deviant movement patterns. Such understanding is key to develop efficient rehabilitation programs. Although UL-3DMA has been shown to be a useful tool to assess movement patterns, it results in a multitude of data, challenging the clinical interpretation and consequently its implementation. UL-3DMA reports are often reduced to summary metrics, such as average or peak values per joint. However, these metrics do not take into account the continuous nature of the data or the interdependency between UL joints, and do not provide phase-specific information of the movement pattern. Moreover, summary metrics may not be sensitive enough to estimate the impact of motor impairments. Recently, Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) was proposed to overcome these problems. We collected UL-3DMA of 60 children with uCP and 60 typically developing children during eight functional tasks and evaluated the impact of spasticity and muscle weakness on UL movement patterns. SPM vector field analysis was used to analyze movement patterns at the level of five joints (wrist, elbow, shoulder, scapula, and trunk). Children with uCP showed deviant movement patterns in all joints during a large percentage of the movement cycle. Spasticity and muscle weakness negatively impacted on UL movement patterns during all tasks, which resulted in increased wrist flexion, elbow pronation and flexion, increased shoulder external rotation, decreased shoulder elevation with a preference for movement in the frontal plane and increased trunk internal rotation. Scapular position was altered during movement initiation, although scapular movements were not affected by muscle weakness or spasticity. In conclusion, we identified pathological movement patterns in children with uCP and additionally mapped the negative impact of spasticity and muscle weakness on these movement patterns, providing useful insights that will contribute to treatment planning. Last, we also identified a subset of the most relevant tasks for studying UL movements in children with uCP, which will facilitate the interpretation of UL-3DMA data and undoubtedly contribute to its clinical implementation.

N2  - Background A previously validated finite element modeling approach was used to determine how changes in glenoid component version and polyethylene liner rotation within the humeral component affect the arm abduction angle at which impingement between the inferior glenoid and the polyethylene liner occurs as well as the amount of subluxation generated by that impingement. Materials and Methods Five glenoid component versions (5° anteversion; neutral; 5°, 10°, and 20° retroversion) and 7 polyethylene liner rotations (20° and 10° anterior; neutral; 10°, 20°, 30°, and 40° posterior) were considered, resulting in 35 different clinically representative models. The humerus was internally and externally rotated and extended and flexed, and the resulting impingement and subluxation were measured. To further analyze more global trends and to identify implantations least prone to subluxation, polyethylene liner rotation was additionally varied in coarser 30° increments across the entire 360° range. Results All subluxation caused by impingement occurred during external rotation and extension, and external rotation produced nearly 10-fold more subluxation than extension. Neutral glenoid component version was associated with the least amount of subluxation for all polyethylene liner rotations. Posteriorly rotated polyethylene liners, which place the thick inferior region of the component away from the scapula, produced the least amount of subluxation. The 90° and 120° posterior liner rotations produced no subluxation, whereas the 30° and 60° anterior liner rotations produced the greatest amount of subluxation. Conclusion These results indicate that rotating modern radially asymmetric humeral polyethylene liners posteriorly can reduce the risk of subluxation leading to dislocation and increase external rotation range of motion.

N2  - Background The number of total shoulder arthroplasties has increased in the past years, with encouraging results. However, the survival of anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) is lower compared with that of knee and hip replacements. Wear-associated problems like loosening are well-known causes of long-term failure of aTSA. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the wear behavior of ceramic-polyethylene bearings compared with the standard metal-polyethylene bearings. Because there is a lack of valid experimental wear testing methods, the secondary aim was to develop a validated wear simulation. Methods The wear assessment was performed using a force-controlled joint simulator for 3 × 106 cycles, and polyethylene wear was assessed gravimetrically and by particle analysis. Kinetic and kinematic data were adopted from in vivo loading measurements and from several clinical studies on shoulder joint kinematics. The reaction of the rotator cuff was simulated on the basis of a virtual soft tissue model. As activity, an abduction-adduction motion of 0°-90° lifting a load of 2 kg superimposed by an anteversion-retroversion has been chosen. Results The studied aTSA resulted in a polyethylene wear rate of 62.75 ± 1.60 mg/106 cycles in combination with metallic heads. The ceramic heads significantly reduced the wear rate by 26.7% to 45.99 ± 1.31 mg/106. There were no relevant differences in terms of the particle characteristics. Conclusion This is the first study that experimentally studied the wear behavior of aTSA based on patient-related and biomechanical data under load-controlled conditions. Regarding polyethylene wear, the analyzed aTSA could benefit from ceramic humeral heads.

N2  - Acromion marker cluster (AMC) methods have been shown to accurately track scapula motion during humeral elevation below 90°, however, their accuracy has not been assessed in shoulder girdle motion such as clavicle protraction, retraction, elevation, and depression independent of humeral movement. The aim of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the AMC method to record scapula orientation at end range clavicle protraction, retraction, elevation, and depression. The right scapulae of 22 female and 20 male asymptomatic volunteers were assessed with an AMC and scapula locator (SL) method during end range clavicle protraction, retraction, elevation, and depression (without humeral elevation) using an 8-camera 3D movement registration system. Measurements recorded from the AMC and SL measures showed fair to excellent agreement (ICC 0.4–0.92). While the AMC method overestimated and underestimated scapular motion in some planes compared to the SL, root mean square error between methods were low for scapular internal/external rotation (2.3–3.7°), upward/downward rotation (4.5–6.6°), and anterior/posterior tilt (3.2–5.1°), across all conditions. The AMC method was shown to be a reliable and valid measurement of scapula orientation at end range clavicle movements independent of humeral movement.

N2  - Objective To analyse the glenopolar angle (GPA) at different inclinations of the scapula using 3D CT, to test the hypothesis that the result could change the indication from conservative treatment to surgery. Materials and Methods Analysis of 30 3D CT images of patients’ scapulae, measuring the GPA. The GPA was measured with scapulae at 0° and at 20° and 30° of internal and external rotation. Angles were compared by age, sex and examiner for the different angles of rotation of the scapulae. Results The GPA of scapulae in rotation tended to be smaller than the GPA without rotation, and the larger the degree of rotation, the more the angle was underestimated. Additionally, for the same degree of rotation, internal rotation was associated with greater underestimation of the GPA than external rotation. Two different examiners achieved an excellent level of agreement between angle measurements. The GPA with the scapula at 0° was significantly higher among elderly patients. The variation in GPA with the scapula in rotation (20° and 30°) in relation to the GPA without rotation was significantly greater for female patients. Conclusions As the rotation of the scapula was displaced from the scapula in the coronal position (GPA 0°), both in internal rotation and in external rotation, the GPA reduced. Therefore, rotational displacement may lead to an error in GPA measurement, resulting in incorrect indication of treatment. It is recommended that whenever possible, GPA measurements should be taken in neutral rotation, with the scapula in a neutral position at 0°.

N2  - Background: Although scapular malpositioning is commonly associated with rotational deficits and risk of injury, modifiable causes of such malpositioning in overhead athletes are not well described. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to examine the scapulothoracic profile of adolescent baseball players, specifically, pectoralis minor (PM) length. We hypothesized that PM would be shorter in throwing shoulders compared with nonthrowing shoulders. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Forty-nine healthy adolescent baseball players underwent clinical screening of PM lengths in throwing and nonthrowing shoulders by means of previously described, validated techniques. PM measurements were conducted while players were supine with arms at rest, sitting with arms at rest, and sitting with shoulders in maximal external rotation; measurements were made with a digital caliper and by assessment of table-to-acromion distance. Static scapular position and range of motion measurements were recorded. Demographic information and playing history were documented. Results: All players were male, they had a mean ± SD age of 16.2 ± 1.16 years, and they predominantly threw right-handed (83.7%). Sixty-nine percent of players were pitchers, 61.2% had played baseball for 9 or more months per year, and 67.3% had played in excess of 30 games in the previous year. Significant differences were noted during side-to-side comparisons within participants. Absolute PM length was significantly shorter in throwing compared with nonthrowing shoulders when measured with players sitting with arms at rest (by 3.7 ± 11.8 mm) and with their shoulders in maximal external rotation (by 4.8 ± 15.1 mm) (P <.004 for both). The PM index was significantly reduced in throwing compared with nonthrowing shoulders while players were supine with arms at rest (P =.007), sitting with arms at rest (P =.006), and sitting with shoulders in maximal external rotation (P <.001). Mean table-to-acromion distance was increased 7.7 ± 1.26 mm in throwing versus nonthrowing arms (P <.001). The scapular index was significantly reduced in throwing compared with nonthrowing shoulders (P <.005). Conclusion: Asymptomatic adolescent baseball players have significant differences in PM length and static scapular measurements in throwing compared with nonthrowing shoulders. The clinical significance requires further investigation, but emphasis on PM stretching routines is encouraged.

N2  - Markers put on the arm undergo large soft tissue artefact (STA). Using markers on the forearm, multibody kinematics optimization (MKO) helps improve the accuracy of the arm kinematics especially its longitudinal rotation. However deleterious effect of STA may persist and affect other segment estimate. The objective was to present an innovative multibody kinematics optimization algorithm with projection of markers onto a requested axis of the local system of coordinates, to cancel their deleterious effect on this degree-of-freedom. Four subjects equipped with markers put on intracortical pins inserted into the humerus, on skin (scapula, arm and forearm) and subsequently on rigid cuffs (arm and forearm) performed analytic, daily-living, sports and range-of-motion tasks. Scapulohumeral kinematics was estimated using 1) pin markers (reference), 2) single-body optimization, 3) MKO, 4) MKO with projection of all arm markers and 5) MKO with projection of a selection of arm markers. Approaches 2–4 were applied to markers put on the skin and the cuff. The main findings were that multibody kinematics optimization improved the accuracy of 40–50% and the projection algorithm added an extra 20% when applied to cuff markers or a selection of skin markers (all but the medial epicondyle). Therefore, the projection algorithm performed better than multibody and single-body optimizations, especially when using markers put on a cuff. Error of humerus orientation was reduced by half to finally be less than 5°. To conclude, this innovative algorithm is a promising approach for estimating accurate upper-limb kinematics.

N2  - This review investigates current protocols using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in shoulder research, and outlines future paths regarding IMU use for shoulder research. Different databases were searched for relevant articles. Criteria for study selection were (1) research in healthy persons or persons with shoulder problems, (2) IMUs applied as assessment tool for the shoulder (in healthy subjects and shoulder patients) or upper limb (in shoulder patients), (3) peer-reviewed, full-text papers in English or Dutch. Studies with less than five participants and without ethical approval were excluded. Data extraction included (1) study design, (2) participant characteristics, (3) type/brand of IMU, (4) tasks included in the assessment protocol, and (5) outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Scapulothoracic/glenohumeral and humerothoracic kinematics were reported in respectively 10 and 27 of the 37 included papers. Only one paper in healthy persons assessed, next to scapulothoracic/glenohumeral kinematics, other upper limb joints. IMUs’ validity and reliability to capture shoulder function was limited. Considering applied protocols, 39% of the protocols was located on the International-Classification-of-Functioning (ICF) function level, while 38% and 23% were on the ‘capacity’ and ‘actual performance’-sublevel, of the ICF-activity level. Most available IMU-research regarding the shoulder is clinically less relevant, given the widely reported humerothoracic kinematics which do not add to clinical-decision-making, and the absence of protocols assessing the complete upper limb chain. Apart from knowledge on methodological pitfalls and opportunities regarding the use of IMUs, this review provides future research paths.

N2  - Background Suprascapular nerve repair is a widely-prioritized procedure for shoulder reconstruction following brachial plexus injury. Although this procedure only reconstructs glenohumeral joint motion, the standard clinical assessment of shoulder function also includes the scapulothoracic joint contribution. The purpose of this preliminary study was to develop an objective method to accurately analyze shoulder abduction following suprascapular nerve repair in brachial plexus injury patients. Methods We introduced an objective method to accurately analyze independent shoulder abduction performed by supraspinatus muscle with the help of dynamic shoulder radiography. Antero-posterior radiographs of both shoulders in adduction and maximal active abduction were obtained. Five parameters were measured. They included global abduction, abduction in glenohumeral, scapulothoracic and clavicular joints along with lateral flexion of thoracic spine. Data were analyzed to distinguish glenohumeral joint contribution from that of scapulothoracic motion. The detailed biomechanics of glenohumeral motion were also analyzed in relation to scapulothoracic motion to separately define the contribution of each in global shoulder abduction. Results The test–retest, intra-examiner and inter-examiner reliabilities of the measurements were assessed. Intra-class correlation coefficient, Bland–Altman plots and repeatability coefficients showed excellent reliability for each parameter. The range of glenohumeral abduction showed high correlation to subtraction of the range of scapulothoracic from the range of global abduction. However, not all negative ranges of glenohumeral abduction meant non-recovery after nerve repair, because scapulothoracic motion contributed in parallel but not uniformly to global shoulder motion. Conclusion The conventional measurement of shoulder global abduction with goniometer is not an appropriate method to analyze the results of suprascapular nerve repair in brachial plexus palsy patients. We recommend examination of glenohumeral and scapulothoracic motions separately with dynamic shoulder radiographic analysis. With scapulothoracic contribution to the global shoulder motion, the glenohumeral motion can be wrongly assessed.

N2  - Background: Various radiographic measurements that describe humeral head coverage by the acromion and the effect on rotator cuff pathology have been reported. This study aimed to describe and validate a new radiographic measurement, the acromiohumeral centre edge angle (ACEA). Methods: We compared the ACEA on computed tomography (CT) and plain X-ray to determine whether X-ray is accurate for measuring this angle. We then compared the results from this control population with 107 patients with acute rotator cuff tears. We compared functional outcomes in rotator cuff tear patients to determine whether the ACEA has any effect on outcome after surgery. An intra- and inter-observer variability analysis was performed and we compared the ACEA to the acromial index (AI) on rotation X-rays. Results: The ACEA was comparable on CT and plain X-ray and was most accurate when true anteroposterior glenohumeral X-rays were used (15.94° vs. 15.87° on CT, p = 0.476). The ACEA showed high intra- and inter-observer reproducibility and was unchanged on internal and external rotation X-rays (20.48 vs. 20.47, p = 0.842), whereas the AI was significantly different (0.74 vs. 0.70, p < 0.001). The ACEA was significantly higher in our rotator cuff tear patients than the control population (23.9° vs. 16.6°, p < 0.001), although a higher ACEA was not associated with poorer outcomes. Conclusion: The ACEA is a valid measurement for describing humeral head coverage by the acromion and can be accurately measured on plain radiographs with good reproducibility. It is unaffected by shoulder rotation and was significantly higher in patients with acute rotator cuff tears.

N2  - Purposes: To evaluate the feasibility of using the single-joint Hybrid Assistive Limb® robot (HAL) to assist with shoulder flexion-extension in healthy adults, and to assess the capacity of the HAL to analyze the bioelectrical signals of muscle activity for shoulder flexion-extension. Methods: This cross-sectional feasibility study included six healthy adult men with no impairment in shoulder motion. The single-joint HAL was fixed to a custom-designed platform and upper arm attachment, and aligned 3 cm below the acromion process. Vital signs, shoulder fatigue, and shoulder pain were evaluated before and after the shoulder elevation exercise performed with and without the HAL. Activity of selected muscles of the shoulder was recorded using a wireless superficial electromyography device. Shoulder movement was captured using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. Results: The HAL supported smooth flexion-extension of the arm at the shoulder joint, with no negative effects on vital signs, shoulder fatigue, and shoulder pain. The HAL decreased muscle activity levels, with a 55% decrease in trapezius muscle activity. The upward rotation angle of the scapula was significantly lower with the HAL at 120° of shoulder flexion. Conclusion: The single-joint HAL provided safe and effective assistance to scapular plane shoulder flexion-extension among healthy adults.

N2  - Management of glenohumeral instability with large Hill-Sachs lesions remains controversial either to address or just grafting the glenoid rim defects. This study was done to investigate if open Latarjet is sufficient to prevent recurrent instability in patients with significant Hill-Sachs defects without addressing these lesions. In the period between October 2009 and November 2014 twenty three patients with shoulder instability and significant bone loss were treated by open Latarjet. All patients were followed up for a period ranged from 17 to 58 months (median ± SD : 30 ± 13.9).The mean preoperative Rowe score was significantly increased from 45.4 to 91.5 (p value <0,001). At the final follow up there was 17 patients with excellent result, 5 patients with good result and 2 patients with fair result. In conclusion, Latarjet provides a reliable and effective stabilization for anteroinferior glenohumeral instability with significant bone loss and engaging Hill-Sachs lesion.

N2  - Identification of scapular dyskinesis and evaluation of interventions depend on the ability to properly measure scapulothoracic (ST) motion. The most widely used measurement approach is the acromion marker cluster (AMC), which can yield large errors in extreme humeral elevation and can be inaccurate in children and patient populations. Recently, an individualized regression approach has been proposed as an alternative to the AMC. This technique utilizes the relationship between ST orientation, humerothoracic orientation and acromion process position derived from calibration positions to predict dynamic ST orientations from humerothoracic and acromion process measures during motion. These individualized regressions demonstrated promising results for healthy adults; however, this method had not yet been compared to the more conventional AMC. This study compared ST orientation estimates by the AMC and regression approaches to static ST angles determined by surface markers placed on palpated landmarks in typically developing adolescents performing functional tasks. Both approaches produced errors within the range reported in the literature for skin-based scapular measurement techniques. The performance of the regression approach suffered when applied to positions outside of the range of motion in the set of calibration positions. The AMC significantly underestimated ST internal rotation across all positions and overestimated posterior tilt in some positions. Overall, root mean square errors for the regression approach were smaller than the AMC for every position across all axes of ST motion. Accordingly, we recommend the regression approach as a suitable technique for measuring ST kinematics in functional motion.

N2  - Objective: The coracoglenoid ligament (CGL) forms part of the anterosuperior capsuloligamentous complex of the shoulder. Although it has received attention in the anatomical literature, it has not been investigated on imaging. The purpose of this study is to determine the percentage value and the interobserver agreement of identification and classification of the CGL on MR and MR arthrography (MRA) imaging. Materials and methods: Retrospectively, 280 MR and 150 MRA examinations were evaluated for detection of the CGL by two musculoskeletal radiologists. On the MRA examinations the CGL configuration in relation to the superior glenohumeral (SGHL) and coracohumeral ligament (CHL) was classified into five types. Additionally, the percentage of intra-articular appearance of the CGL and its mean thickness value were calculated. Finally, a possible correlation between pathological condition and anatomical type was evaluated on MRA. Results: The CGL could be identified in 56%/54% of MRI and in 76%/77% of MRA examinations. On MRA, the CGL was detected as distinct structures in 37%/35% of cases and it appeared fused (partially or totally) with the SGHL and/or CHL in 39%/42%; it was absent in 12%/12% and it appears undistinguishable in the remaining cases. The interobserver agreement was excellent (κ = 0.98 for detection on MRI; p = 0.927 for classification of anterosuperior anatomy on MRA; κ = 0.873 and 0.978 for identification on sagittal and axial external rotation MRA respectively; κ = 0.943 for classification as intra- or extra-articular on MRA). Conclusions: The CGL can be reliably identified on MRI and MRA.

N2  - Background Stroke can lead to altered scapular motion that may limit the ability to perform activities of daily living. The aims were to evaluate scapular kinematics of individuals with chronic stroke and the correlation with paretic arm function. Methods Scapular kinematics was assessed in thirty-four individuals (Chronic stroke = 17; controls = 17) during arm elevation and lowering in scapular and self-selected planes, and during hair combing. The use of the paretic arm to perform activities of daily living was assessed by the Motor Activity Log (MAL-30). Scapular kinematics was compared among paretic and non-paretic arms, and controls. Correlation between scapular kinematics and MAL-30 was also verified. Findings Paretic and non-paretic arms showed increased scapular internal rotation (p < 0.05) during arm lowering in the scapular plane, and during arm elevation and lowering in the self-selected plane compared to controls. Increased internal rotation (p < 0.05) was also found in the paretic arm during hair combing compared to controls. Increased scapular anterior tilt (p < 0.05) was observed in the paretic arm during arm elevation while performing the activity of hair combing and during arm elevation and lowering in the scapular and self-selected planes compared to controls. The non-paretic arm showed increased anterior tilt (p < 0.05) during arm elevation and lowering in self-selected plane compared to controls. No difference in scapular upward rotation among neither arms, nor correlation between scapular kinematics and MAL-30 were found (p > 0.05). Interpretation Individuals with chronic stroke showed bilateral scapular kinematics alterations. However, these alterations are not correlated with paretic arm function.

N2  - Study Design Cross-sectional. Background The scapular dyskinesis test (SDT) has demonstrated reliability and validity, but its utility for clinical decision making is unclear. Objectives To characterize the prevalence of scapular dyskinesis in participants with and without shoulder pain, and to determine the influence of blinding to the presence of shoulder pain on prevalence of scapular dyskinesis. Methods Participants (n = 135), 67 with shoulder pain and 68 healthy controls, were included in this study. The SDT was performed by 2 examiners, from a total of 21 physical therapists. The second examiner was blinded to the participant's presence of shoulder pain. The SDT involved participants performing 5 repetitions of shoulder flexion and abduction, while the clinician observed for scapular dyskinesis, as characterized by scapular winging or dysrhythmia. Dyskinesis was rated as normal, subtle, or obvious. Ratings were collapsed into 2 groups, dyskinesis (subtle and obvious) and no dyskinesis (normal), as recommended by expert consensus. Results There were no significant differences for scapular dyskinesis prevalence between the shoulder pain group and control group during the SDT in abduction (shoulder pain, 67.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55, 0.77 and control group, 52.9%; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.64; P = .09) or flexion (shoulder pain, 67.2%; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.77 and control group, 61.8%; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.72; P = .51). There were significant differences (P ≤001) between the examiners' SDT ratings in the shoulder pain group. The unblinded examiner reported a higher prevalence when testing the involved shoulder for dyskinesis in flexion (blinded, 67.7%; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.78 and unblinded, 80%; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.88) and during abduction (blinded, 66.2%; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.76 and unblinded, 78.5%; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.87). Conclusion Scapular dyskinesis as assessed with the SDT is not more prevalent in those with shoulder pain. Rating was influenced by an examiner's knowledge of shoulder pain presence. Scapular dyskinesis may represent normal movement variability. Level of Evidence Diagnosis, level 4. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2017;47(8):530-537. Epub 6 Jul 2017. doi:10.2519/jospt.2017.7268.

N2  - This study investigated the characteristics of arm elevation via principal component analysis in symptomatic overhead athletes with scapular dyskinesis. One hundred-thirty-four overhead athletes with scapular dyskinesis [24: inferior angle prominence (pattern I); 46: medial border prominence (pattern II), 64: pattern I + II] were evaluated by three-dimensional electromagnetic motion and electromyography to record the scapular kinematics (upward rotation/posterior tipping/exterior rotation) and muscle activation (upper trapezius: UT; middle trapezius: MT; lower trapezius: LT; serratus anterior: SA) during lowering phase of arm elevation. The results showed: (1) for pattern I and II, the first 3 principal component (PCs) explained 41.4% and 42.6% of total variance of movement; (2) the first PCs were correlated with MT, LT activity (r = 0.41~0.61) and upward rotation, posterior tipping (r = -0.59~-0.33) in pattern I, and UT, MT, SA (r = 0.30~0.70) activity in pattern II; (3) contour plots of muscle activity demonstrated that muscle activities varied with dyskinesis patterns. In summary, for the pattern I, the major characteristics are coactivation of MT and LT and corresponding scapular posterior tipping and upward rotation. For the pattern II, the major characteristics are coactivation of UT, MT and SA without corresponding scapular external rotation.

N2  - Purpose: To assess reliability and validity of a trunk deformity evaluation method expressed as rotational and lateral lean angles between the upper and the lower trunk and between the lower trunk and the pelvis using 3D positions of six front body surface landmarks. Methods: Inter- and intra-rater reliabilities of the proposed method in adults with typical development (n = 22) were assessed, and its validity was also assessed through correlations between the Cobb angle and the analyzed trunk deformity parameters in adults with severe physical disabilities (n = 22). Results: The mean differences between two raters and between the initial and second measures were within 2°. Moderate correlations were found between the Cobb angle and both the upper and the lower trunk lateral lean angle and the upper trunk rotation angle. Conclusions: The proposed trunk deformity evaluation appears to be a reliable and valid approach for bedridden people with physical disabilities.

N2  - Purpose: To understand the geometry of the proximal humerus and glenoid fossa to facilitate the design of components used in shoulder arthroplasty. The aim is to evaluate the geometry of the proximal humerus and glenoid fossa and their relationship using a MicroScribe 3D digitizer. Methods: Scans and measurements were obtained from 20 pairs of dry proximal humeri and scapulae [10 female and 10 male cadavers: median age 81 years (range 70–94 years)] using a MicroScribe 3D digitizer and Rhinoceros software. Results: Means (±SD) of humeral inclination, medial wall angle of the bicipital groove, and radius of the humeral head values were 135 ± 11°, 39 ± 19°, and 14 ± 3 mm, respectively. Means (±SD) of glenoid height and width were 35 ± 4 and 26 ± 4 mm, while the means (±SD) of the angles of glenoid inclination, retroversion, and rotation were 87 ± 32°, 96 ± 10°, and 9 ± 6°, respectively. A significant difference in glenoid height (P ≤ 0.002) and width (P ≤ 0.0001) was observed between males and females, despite them having almost an identical radius of the humeral head, glenoid inclination, retroversion, and angle of rotation. There was also a significant difference (P ≤ 0.01) in the angle of glenoid retroversion between the right and left sides. Conclusions: Using a MicroScribe 3D digitizer, the glenoid fossa was observed to be significantly smaller in females than males; furthermore, there was a difference in glenoid retroversion between the right and left sides.

N2  - Study design Systematic review. Objectives The aim of this systematic review was to summarize and evaluate intra- and interrater reliability research of physical examination tests used for the assessment of scapular dyskinesis. Background Scapular dyskinesis, defined as alteration of normal scapular kinematics, is described as a non-specific response to different shoulder pathologies. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED and PEDro until March 20th, 2015. Methodological quality was assessed with the Quality Appraisal of Reliability Studies (QAREL) by two independent reviewers. Results The search strategy revealed 3259 articles, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. These studies evaluated the reliability of 41 test and test variations used for the assessment of scapular dyskinesis. Conclusion This review identified a lack of high-quality studies evaluating intra- as well as interrater reliability of tests used for the assessment of scapular dyskinesis. In addition, reliability measures differed between included studies hindering proper cross-study comparisons. The effect of manual correction of the scapula on shoulder symptoms was evaluated in only one study, which is striking, since symptom alteration tests are used in routine care to guide further treatment. Thus, there is a strong need for further research in this area. Level of evidence Diagnosis, level 3a.

N2  - Objectives Levator scapulae (LS) muscle stretching exercises are a common method of lengthening a shortened muscle; however, the appropriate stretching position for lengthening the LS in people with a shortened LS remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of different stretching exercise positions on the LS and introduce effective stretching exercise methods to clinicians. Participants Twenty-four university students (12 men, 12 women) with a shortened LS were recruited. Methods LS muscle activity, LS index (LSI), and cervical range of motion (ROM) were measured pre (baseline) and post three different stretching exercise positions (sitting, quadruped, and prone). Results The LSI and cervical ROM exceeded the minimal detectable change and had significant changes. The LSI was greater in the sitting position than at the baseline (p = 0.01), quadruped position (p < 0.01); the LSI in the prone position presented a higher increase than the quadruped position (p = 0.01). The cervical ROM increased in the sitting position when compared to the baseline (p < 0.01) and quadruped position (p < 0.01). Conclusions Stretching the LS in the sitting position was the most effective exercise for improving LS muscle length and cervical ROM.

N2  - Background Movement faults are commonly observed in patients with musculoskeletal pain. The Kinetic Medial Rotation Test (KMRT) is a movement control test used to identify movement faults of the scapula and gleno-humeral joints during arm movement. Objective tests such as the KMRT need to be reliable and valid for the results to be applied across different clinical settings and patient populations. The primary objective of the present study was to determine the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of KMRT in subjects with and without shoulder pain. Methods Sixty subjects were included in this study based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two musculoskeletal physiotherapists with different levels of clinical experience performed the tests. The intra-rater reliability was tested in twenty asymptomatic subjects by a single assessor at two week intervals. An equal number of subjects with and without shoulder pain were tested by both the assessors to determine the inter-rater reliability. Both components of the KMRT, the Gleno- Humeral Anterior Translation (GHAT) and the Scapular Forward Tilt (SCFT) were tested. Results The Kappa values for inter-rater reliability of the GHAT and SCFT were K = 0.68 & K = 0.65 respectively in subjects with shoulder pain. In asymptomatic subjects, the inter-rater reliability of GHAT was K = 0.61 and SCFT was K = 0.85. Intra-rater reliability ranged from K = 0.66 for GHAT to K = 0.87 for SCFT. Conclusion Our study found substantial agreement in inter-rater reliability of KMRT in subjects with shoulder pain, whereas substantial to near perfect agreement was found in intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of KMRT in subjects without shoulder pain.

N2  - Introduction: The clinical application of upper limb (UL) three-dimensional movement analysis (3DMA) in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP) remains challenging, despite its benefits compared to conventional clinical scales. Moreover, knowledge on UL movement pathology and how this relates to clinical parameters remains scarce. Therefore, we investigated UL kinematics across different manual ability classification system (MACS) levels and explored the relation between clinical and kinematic parameters in children with uCP. Patients and methods: Fifty children (MACS: I = 15, II = 26, III = 9) underwent an UL evaluation of sensorimotor impairments (grip force, muscle strength, muscle tone, two-point discrimination, stereognosis), bimanual performance (Assisting Hand Assessment, AHA), unimanual capacity (Melbourne Assessment 2, MA2) and UL-3DMA during hand-to-head, hand-to-mouth and reach-to-grasp tasks. Global parameters (Arm Profile Score (APS), duration, (timing of) maximum velocity, trajectory straightness) and joint specific parameters (angles at task endpoint, ROM and Arm Variable Scores (AVS)) were extracted. The APS and AVS refer respectively to the total amount of movement pathology and movement deviations of wrist, elbow, shoulder, scapula and trunk. Results: Longer movement durations and increased APS were found with higher MACS-levels (p<0.001). Increased APS was also associated with more severe sensorimotor impairments (r = -0.30-(-0.73)) and with lower AHA and MA2-scores (r = -0.50-(-0.86)). For the joint specific parameters, stronger movement deviations distally were significantly associated with increased muscle weakness (r = -0.32-(-0.74)) and muscle tone (r = 0.33-(-0.61)); proximal movement deviations correlated only with muscle weakness (r = -0.35–0.59). Regression analysis exposed grip force as the most important predictor for the variability in APS (p<0.002). Conclusion: We found increased movement pathology with increasing MACS-levels and demonstrated the adverse impact of especially muscle weakness. The lower correlations suggest that 3DMA provides additional information regarding UL motor function, particularly for the proximal joints. Integrating both methods seems clinically meaningful to obtain a comprehensive representation of all aspects of a child’s UL functioning.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the biomechanical performance of four different methods used for coracoclavicular (CC) ligament reconstruction in a lateral clavicle fracture repair.
METHODS: Native displacement, translation, and rotation at the acromioclavicular joint of 24 fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were tested. A reproducible fracture in the lateral third of the clavicle was created by dissecting both CC ligaments. Each specimen was then repaired with plate fixation of the fracture and the following CC repair technique: (1) Cortical button. (2) Suture anchor and plate button. (3) Suture anchor no plate button, and (4) Suture around coracoid. All reconstructed specimens were then re-tested for displacement, translation, and load to failure, and compared to their native results. Groups 1 and 3 were investigated for rotational load.
RESULTS: There was no difference in load to failure between the repaired groups (p: ns). Group 1 showed less superior and anterior translations (p < 0.05). Group 2 showed significantly less superior translation (p = 0.003), but no significance with anterior and posterior translations to the native joint. Group 3 showed less superior and posterior translations (p = 0.005 and p = 0.039). Anterior and posterior translations were increased in group 4 (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The biomechanical analyses did not show any significance in load to failure or displacement after cyclic loading among the study groups. All repairs were effective in preventing superior translation. Groups 1 and 2 demonstrated increased horizontal stability compared to the native state. All 4 methods are clinically viable options for CC ligament repair.

KW  - skeletal muscle
N2  - Subject-specific musculoskeletal models can predict accurate joint and muscle biomechanics thereby helping clinicians and surgeons. Current modeling strategies do not incorporate accurate subject-specific muscle parameters. This study reports a statistical shape model (SSM) based method to predict subject-specific muscle attachment regions on shoulder bones and illustrates the concurrent validity of the predictions. Augmented SSMs of scapula and humerus bones were built using bone meshes and five muscle attachment (origin/insertion) regions which play important role in the shoulder motion and function. Muscle attachments included Subscapularis, Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres Major and Teres Minor on both the bones. The regions were represented by subset of vertices on the bone meshes and were tracked using vertex identifiers. Subject-specific muscle attachment regions were predicted using external set of bones not used in building the SSMs. Validity of predictions was determined by visual inspection and also by using four similarity measures between predicted and manually segmented regions. Excellent concurrent validity was found indicating the higher accuracy of predictions. This method can be effectively employed in modeling pipelines or in automatic segmentation of medical images. Further validations are warranted on all the muscles of the shoulder complex.

N2  - Background: Characteristics of rugby tackles that lead to primary anterior shoulder dislocation remain unclear. Purpose: To clarify the characteristics of tackling that lead to shoulder dislocation and to assess the correlation between the mechanism of injury and morphological damage of the glenoid. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Eleven elite rugby players who sustained primary anterior shoulder dislocation due to one-on-one tackling between 2001 and 2014 were included. Using an assessment system, the tackler’s movement, posture, and shoulder and head position were evaluated in each phase of tackling. Based on 3-dimensional computed tomography, the glenoid of the affected shoulder was classified into 3 types: intact, erosion, and bone defect. Orientation of the glenoid defect and presence of Hill-Sachs lesion were also evaluated. Results: Eleven tackles that led to primary shoulder dislocation were divided into hand, arm, and shoulder tackle types based on the site at which the tackler contacted the ball carrier initially. In hand and arm tackles, the tackler’s shoulder joint was forcibly moved to horizontal abduction by the impact of his upper limb, which appeared to result from an inappropriate approach to the ball carrier. In shoulder tackles, the tackler’s head was lowered and was in front of the ball carrier at impact. There was no significant correlation between tackle types and the characteristics of bony lesions of the shoulder. Conclusion: Although the precise mechanism of primary anterior shoulder dislocation could not be estimated from this single-view analysis, failure of individual tackling leading to injury is not uniform and can be caused by 2 main factors: failure of approach followed by an extended arm position or inappropriate posture of the tackler at impact, such as a lowered head in front of the opponent. These findings indicate that injury mechanisms should be assessed for each type of tackle, as it is unknown whether external force to the glenoid is different in each mechanism during shoulder dislocation.

N2  - Background A depressed scapular alignment could lead to prolonged and repetitive stress or compression of the brachial plexus, resulting in sensitization of neural tissue. However, no study has investigated the influence of alignment of the scapulae on sensitization of upper limb neural tissue in otherwise asymptomatic people. In this case-control study, we investigate the influence of a depressed scapular alignment on mechanosensitivity of the upper limb peripheral nervous system as well as pressure pain thresholds (PPT). Methods Asymptomatic individuals with neutral vertical scapular alignment (n = 25) or depressed scapular alignment (n = 25) participated. We measured the upper limb neurodynamic test (ULNT1), including assessment of symptom response and elbow range of motion (ROM), and PPT measured over upper limb peripheral nerve trunks, the upper trapezius muscle and overlying cervical zygapophyseal joints. Results Subjects with a depressed scapular reported significantly greater pain intensity (t = 5.7, p < 0.0001) and reduced elbow extension ROM (t = −2.7, p < 0.01) during the ULNT1 compared to those with a normal scapular orientation. Regardless of the location tested, the group presenting with a depressed scapular had significantly lower PPT compared to those with a normal scapular orientation (PPT averaged across all sites: normal orientation: 3.3 ± 0.6 kg/cm2, depressed scapular: 2.1 ± 0.5 kg/cm2, p < 0.00001). Conclusions Despite being asymptomatic, people with a depressed scapular have greater neck and upper limb neural tissue mechanosensitivity when compared to people with a normal scapular orientation. This study offers insight into the potential development of neck-arm pain due to a depressed scapular position.

N2  - Background: 10% of the points for the Constant–Murley score (CMS) are allocated for the capacity for internal rotation (IR), measured as unassisted active movement of the dorsum of the hand or the thumb to reach different anatomical landmarks. However, there is little information about the validity of this method and no three-dimensional measurement of the degree of IR that is necessary to reach these landmarks. Methods: Sixteen volunteers with healthy shoulders were recruited. The degree of IR was defined using the following landmarks as described in the CMS: (1) lateral aspect of thigh, (2) buttock, (3) sacroiliac joint, (4) level of waist, (5) vertebra T12, (6) interscapular. The validity of IR measurement was assessed by simultaneous 3D motion analysis. Results: Using the thumb as pointer, there were significant increases in IR from 39.3° at position 1 to 80.4° at position 2, followed by 105.1°, 108.6°, 110.1°, and 125.3° at position 3–6. Taking the dorsum of the hand as pointer, there were significant increases in IR between all positions, starting from 71.2° (position 1) and followed by 99.3°, 104.1°, 110.3°, 115.2°, and 119.7° at positions 2 to 6. Comparing the two measurement methods, a significant difference was found for the amount of IR between positions 1 and 2. Conclusion: Measurement of IR as described in the CMS is a suitable method. However, there was an increase of only 10° in IR between positions 3 and 5, which may be hard to measure with a standard goniometer in clinical practice.

N2  - Repetitive overhead movements have been identified as a main risk factor to develop shoulder complaints with scapular muscle activity being altered. Reliable assessment of muscle activity is essential to differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the intra- and inter-session reliability of scapular muscle activity during maximal isokinetic shoulder flexion and extension. Eleven asymptomatic adults performed maximum effort isokinetic shoulder flexion and extension (concentric and eccentric at 60°/s) in a test-retest design. Muscle activity of the upper and lower trapezius and serratus anterior was assessed by sEMG. Root Mean Square was calculated for whole ROM and single movement phases of absolute and normalized muscle activity. Absolute (Bland-Altman analysis (Bias, LoA), Minimal detectable change (MDC)) and relative reliability parameters (Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV)/test-retest variability (TRV)) were utilized for the evaluation of reproducibility. Intra-session reliability revealed ICCs between 0.56 and 0.98, averaged CVs of 18% and average MDCs of 81 mV. Inter-session reliability resulted in ICCs between 0.13 and 0.93, averaged TRVs of 21%, average MDCs of 15% and systematic and random error between −8 ± 60% and 12 ± 36%. Scapular muscle activity assessed in overhead movements can be measured reliably under maximum load conditions, though variability is dependent on the movement phase. Measurement variability does not exceed magnitudes of altered scapular muscle activities as reported in previous studies. Therefore, maximum load application is a promising approach for the evaluation of changes in scapular control related to pathologies.

N2  - Idiopathic Brachial Neuritis (IBN), is a rare brachial plexopathy with an unknown aetiology. Multiple myeloma is a neoplastic plasma cell disease characterised by bone lesions. In this article, we present the case of a 59-year-old male patient with IBN associated with multiple myeloma, who was admitted to our clinic with right shoulder pain and right arm weakness. He experienced muscle weakness and atrophy in his right arm after a sudden onset of pain attack in the shoulder. Plexus and cervical vertebral MRI showed no pathology. Electrodiagnostic studies showed upper and middle trunk plexopathies. Laboratory analysis revealed anaemia, hypercalcaemia, renal dysfunction and monoclonal gammopathy in immunoglobulin electrophoresis. A bone marrow biopsy established the diagnosis of IgG kappa multiple myeloma. This is the first case report that presents the association of multiple myeloma and IBN.

N2  - Most colobine monkeys primarily move through their arboreal environment quadrupedally. Douc langurs (Pygathrix spp.), however, are regularly observed to use suspensory behaviors at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center (EPRC) in Northern Vietnam. Previous work has linked variation in scapular morphology to different modes of primate arboreal locomotion. Here we investigate whether the shape of the Pygathrix scapula resembles obligate brachiators (gibbons) or obligate arboreal quadrupeds (other cercopithecoids). Using a MicroScribe G2X 3D digitizer, the positions of 17 landmarks were recorded on 15 different species of nonhuman primates (n = 100) from three categories of locomotor behavior: brachiator, arboreal quadruped, and unknown (Pygathrix). All analyses were conducted in the R package geomorph. A Procrustes analysis uniformly scaled the shape data and placed specimens into the same morphospace. A Principal Component Analysis was used to examine scapular shape and a Procrustes ANOVA was conducted to test for shape difference in the scapulae. A pairwise analysis was used to compare the means of the locomotor categories and identify any statistically significant differences. A phylogenetically controlled Procrustes ANOVA was also conducted using a phylogeny from 10kTrees. Results show Pygathrix scapular morphology is significantly different from both arboreal colobine quadrupeds (p < 0.01) and hylobatid brachiators (p < 0.01). It does, however, share some features with each including a long vertebral border, like other cercopithecoids, and a more laterally projecting acromion process, like the hylobatids. The principal difference segregating Pygathrix from both the arboreal quadrupeds and the brachiators is the more medially placed superior angle. These nuanced morphological characteristics associated with suspensory behaviors may be useful for inferring suspensory locomotion in the primate fossil record.

N2  - Background The teres minor muscle is a focused topic on the treatment of massive rotator cuff tears and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Its precise anatomy and function have not been completely investigated. The purposes of this study were to anatomically investigate the muscle and analyze electromyographic (EMG) activities during shoulder motion. Methods This anatomic study used 20 shoulders from deceased donors (mean age, 75.0 years). EMG data were recorded from 10 healthy volunteers (mean age, 21.7 years) during flexion, abduction, and external rotations at 0° of abduction, at 90° of abduction, and at 90° of flexion in their dominant arms synchronized with a computerized 3-dimensional motion analysis system. Results The muscle in all specimens consisted of 2 distinct muscular bundles: the upper and lower portions. The upper portion attached to the round area of the greater tuberosity, and the lower portion inserted into the linear shaped area. Both portions were independent in their origins, insertions, and innervation. The muscle engaged force during each shoulder motion. EMG activities of abduction and the 3 forms of external rotation were similar. Maximal voluntary contraction in the 3 forms of external rotation was 32% in maximum external rotation in the neutral position, 25% in flexion, and 40% in abduction. Conclusions The teres minor consists of independent upper and lower portions. The muscle engages force in all ranges of 5 shoulder motions, and maximum external rotation in abduction is a reliable method to evaluate potential activity of the muscle.

N2  - Kinematics of the shoulder girdle obtained from non-invasive measurement systems such as video motion analysis, accelerometers and magnetic tracking sensors has been shown to be adversely affected by instrumentation measurement errors and skin motion artefact. The degree to which musculoskeletal model calculations of shoulder muscle and joint loading are influenced by variations in joint kinematics is currently not well understood. A three-dimensional musculoskeletal model of the upper limb was used to evaluate the sensitivity of shoulder muscle and joint force. Monte-Carlo analyses were performed by randomly perturbing scapular and humeral joint coordinates during abduction and flexion. Muscle and joint force calculations were generally most sensitive to changes in the kinematics of the humerus in elevation and of the scapula in medial-lateral rotation, and were least sensitive to changes in humerus plane of elevation and scapula protraction-retraction. Overall model sensitivity was greater during abduction than flexion, and the influence of specific kinematics perturbations varied from muscle to muscle. In general, muscles that generated greater force, such as the middle deltoid and subscapularis, were more sensitive to changes in shoulder kinematics. This study suggests that musculoskeletal model sensitivity to changes in kinematics is task-specific, and varies depending on the plane of motion. Calculations of shoulder muscle and joint function depend on reliable humeral and scapula motion data, particularly that of humeral elevation and scapula medial-lateral rotation. The findings in this study have implications for the use of kinematic data in musculoskeletal model development and simulations.

N2  - Background Glenoid component positioning in reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is challenging. Patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) has been advocated to improve accuracy, and is based on precise preoperative planning. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of glenoid component positioning when only the glenoid surface is visible, compared to when the entire scapula is visible on a 3D virtual model. Methods CT scans of 30 arthritic shoulders were reconstructed in 3D models. Two surgeons then virtually placed a glenosphere component in the model while visualizing only the glenoid surface, in order to simulate typical intraoperative exposure (“blind 3D” surgery). One surgeon then placed the component in an ideal position while visualizing the entire scapula (“visible 3D” surgery). These two positions were then compared, and the accuracy of glenoid component positioning was assessed in terms of correction of native glenoid version and tilt, and avoidance of glenoid vault perforation. Results Mean version and tilt after “blind 3D” surgery were +1.4° (SD 8.8°) and +7.6° (SD 6°), respectively; glenoid vault perforation occurred in 17 specimens. Mean version and tilt after “visible 3D” surgery were +0.3° (SD 0.8°) and +0.1° (SD 0.5°), respectively, with glenoid vault perforation in 6 cases. “Visible 3D” surgery provided significantly better accuracy than “blind 3D” surgery (P < 0.05). Conclusion When the entire scapula is used as reference, accuracy is improved and glenoid vault perforation is less frequent. This type of visualization is only possible with pre-operative 3D CT planning, and may be augmented by PSI. Level of evidence Basic science study. Level III.

N2  - This study explored the coordination between the components of the shoulder girdle (clavicle, scapula and humerus), and how they contribute to hand movement in the peri-personal space. Shoulder girdle motion was recorded in 10 healthy subjects during pointing movements to 9 targets in the peri-personal space, using electromagnetic sensors fixed to the trunk, scapula and upper arm. Most of the 9 degrees of freedom (DoF) of the shoulder girdle were finely scaled to target position. Principle component analysis revealed that the 6 DoF of scapula-thoracic motion were coordinated in three elementary patterns (protraction, shrug and lateral rotation). The ratio of gleno-humeral to scapulo-thoracic global motion was close to 2:1. A direct kinematic procedure showed that if no scapular motion occurred, the workspace would be reduced by 15.8 cm laterally, 13.7 cm vertically and 4.8 cm anteriorly. Scapulo-thoracic motion should be taken into account when investigating the physiology of upper-limb movements.

N2  - The goal of this study was to develop and validate a non-invasive approach to estimate scapular kinematics in individual patients. We hypothesized that individualized mathematical algorithms can be developed using motion capture data to accurately estimate dynamic scapula orientation based on measured humeral orientations and acromion process positions. The accuracy of the mathematical algorithms was evaluated against a gold standard of biplane fluoroscopy using a 2D to 3D fluoroscopy/model matching process. Individualized linear models were developed for nine healthy adult shoulders. These models were used to predict scapulothoracic kinematics, and the predicted kinematics were compared to kinematics obtained using biplane fluoroscopy to determine the accuracy of the algorithms. Results showed strong correlations between mathematically predicted kinematics and validation kinematics. Estimated kinematics were within 8° of validation kinematics. We concluded that individualized linear models show promise for providing accurate, non-invasive measurements of scapulothoracic kinematics in a clinical environment.

N2  - This study evaluated a strategy for identifying 3D scapulothoracic orientation using bilateral X-ray scans and 3D scapula models. Both subject-specific scapula models and a scaled general model were utilized. 3D scapulothoracic orientations obtained from X-rays were compared to motion capture data. “Subjects” consisted of a skeletal model of a human torso and ten real bone scapulae. Retroreflective markers were placed on the scapulae and a three-marker triad was placed on the trunk. Marker positions were recorded using an eight camera motion capture system. A biplane X-ray system from EOS Imaging was used to collect two orthogonal 2D images of the skeleton and markers. Custom software was created for the 3D to 2D matching process. The results indicated that the matched orientations compared favorably to motion capture orientations, with RMSE errors ranging from 3.1° to 5.5° and a mean error of 3.9° The proposed strategy was shown to be accurate for both subject-specific models and a scaled general model.

N2  - Background The physical signs of obstetrical brachial plexus palsy range from temporary upper-limb dysfunction to a lifelong impairment and deformity in one arm. The aim of this study was to analyze the kinematics of the upper limb and to evaluate the contribution of glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints of obstetrical brachial plexus palsy children. Methods Six children participated in this study: 2 males and 4 females with a mean age of 11.7 years. Three patients had a C5, C6 lesion and 3 had a C5, C6, C7 lesion. They were asked to perform five tasks based on the Mallet scale and the kinematic data were collected using the Fastrak electromagnetic tracking device. Findings The scapulothoracic protraction and posterior tilt were significantly increased in the involved limb during the hand to mouth task (p = 0.006 and p = 0.015 respectively). The scapulothoracic Protraction/glenohumeral Elevation ratio was significantly increased in the involved limb during the hand to neck task (p = 0.041) and the elevation task (p = 0.015). The ratios of scapulothoracic Tilt on the three glenohumeral excursion angles were significantly increased during the hand to mouth task (p ≤ 0.041). The scapulothoracic Mediolateral/glenohumeral Elevation ratio was significantly increased in the involved limb during the elevation task (p = 0.038). The glenohumeral elevation excursion was significantly decreased in the involved limb during the hand to neck task (p < 0.001) and the elevation task (p = 0.0003). Interpretation This study gives us information about the greater contribution of the scapulothoracic joint to shoulder motion for affected arm of obstetrical brachial plexus palsy patients compared to their unaffected arm. Kinematic analysis could be useful in shoulder motion evaluation during the Mallet score and to evaluate outcomes after surgery.

N2  - Coordinated reach-to-grasp movements require precise spatiotemporal synchrony between proximal forelimb muscles (shoulder, elbow) that transport the hand toward a target during reach, and distal muscles (wrist, digit) that simultaneously preshape and orient the hand for grasp. The precise mechanisms through which the redundant neuromuscular circuitry coordinates reach with grasp, however, remain unclear. Recently, Geed and Van Kan (2016) demonstrated, using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), that limited numbers of global, template-like transport/preshape- and grasprelated muscle components underlie the complexity and variability of intramuscular electromyograms (EMGs) of up to 21 distal and proximal muscles recorded while monkeys performed reach-to-grasp tasks. Importantly, transport/preshape- and grasprelated muscle components showed invariant spatiotemporal coupling, which provides a potential mechanism for coordinating forelimb muscles during reach-to-grasp movements. In the present study, we tested whether ensemble discharges of forelimb neurons in the cerebellar nucleus interpositus (NI) and its target, the magnocellular red nucleus (RNm), a source of rubrospinal fibers, function as neuronal correlates of the transport/preshape- and grasp-related muscle components we identified. EFA applied to single-unit discharges of populations of NI and RNm neurons recorded while the same monkeys that were used previously performed the same reach-tograsp tasks, revealed neuronal components in the ensemble discharges of both NI and RNm neuronal populations with characteristics broadly similar to muscle components. Subsets of NI and RNm neuronal components were strongly and significantly cross-correlated with subsets of muscle components, suggesting that similar functional units of reach-to-grasp behavior are expressed by NI and RNm neuronal populations and forelimb muscles. Importantly, like transport/preshape- and grasp-related muscle components, their NI and RNm neuronal correlates showed invariant spatiotemporal coupling. Clinical and lesion studies have reported disruption of coupling between reach and grasp following cerebellar damage; the present results expand on those studies by identifying a neuronal mechanism that may underlie cerebellar contributions to spatiotemporal coordination of distal and proximal limb muscles during reaching to grasp. We conclude that finding similar functional units of behavior expressed at multiple levels of information processing along interposito-rubrospinal pathways and forelimb muscles supports the hypothesis that functionally related populations of NI and RNm neurons act synergistically in the control of complex coordinated motor behaviors.

N2  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) may result in tetraplegia (motor and/or sensory nervous system impairment of the arms, trunk and legs) or paraplegia (motor and/or sensory impairment of the trunk and/or legs only). The adverse effects of SCI on health, fitness and functioning are frequently compounded by profoundly sedentary behaviour. People with paraplegia (PP) and tetraplegia (TP) have reduced exercise capacity due to paralysis/paresis and reduced exercising stroke volume. TP often further reduces exercise capacity due to lower maximum heart-rate and respiratory function. There is strong, consistent evidence that exercise can improve cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength in people with SCI. There is emerging evidence for a range of other exercise benefits, including reduced risk of cardio-metabolic disease, depression and shoulder pain, as well as improved respiratory function, quality-of-life and functional independence. Exercise recommendations for people with SCI are: ≥30 min of moderate aerobic exercise on ≥5 d/week or ≥20 min of vigorous aerobic ≥3 d/week; strength training on ≥2 d/week, including scapula stabilisers and posterior shoulder girdle; and ≥2 d/week flexibility training, including shoulder internal and external rotators. These recommendations may be aspirational for profoundly inactive clients and stratification into “beginning”, “intermediate” and “advanced” will assist application of the recommendations in clinical practice. Flexibility exercise is recommended to preserve upper limb function but may not prevent contracture. For people with TP, Rating of Perceived Exertion may provide a more valid indication of exercise intensity than heart rate. The safety and effectiveness of exercise interventions can be enhanced by initial screening for autonomic dysreflexia, orthostatic hypotension, exercise-induced hypotension, thermoregulatory dysfunction, pressure sores, spasticity and pain.

N2  - Background The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of current techniques for dynamic 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of idiopathic severe frozen shoulder (FS). Materials and methods Subjects consisted of 5 healthy volunteers and 16 patients with idiopathic severe FS. We defined severe idiopathic FS as follows: range of motion ≤100° in forward flexion, ≤10° in external rotation, and ≤L5 in internal rotation. All patients suffered from continued global range of motion loss for at least 6 months. We evaluated the diagnostic characteristics of 3-dimensional dynamic MRI in FS patients compared with those in healthy volunteers. Results MRI of all FS patients displayed an abnormal intake of blood flow from the acromial arterial network and the branches of circumflex humeral arteries into the axillary pouch and the rotator interval. We named this finding “burning sign.” The burning sign was present at all phases of the condition. In the FS group, the patients with enhanced deposition of contrast medium in the axillary pouch in the delayed phase (n = 11) had a statistically significant score for pain during exercise, higher than that of patients with reduced deposition of contrast medium at the same site (n = 5; P = .027). Conclusion Burning sign is an abnormal finding that appears in dynamic MRI of severe FS. Hence, the burning sign may be associated with pain and inflammation in idiopathic FS.

N2  - The overhead pitching motion is a coordinated sequence of movements that subjects the shoulder to extreme forces. The ultimate goal of this complex, dynamic activity is to generate high ball velocity and accuracy. In doing so, repetitive throwing can cause adaptive and pathologic changes in the thrower's shoulder. This article reviews the relevant shoulder anatomy, the kinetic chain, and throwing mechanics, as well as common shoulder injuries and surgical options for the treating orthopedic surgeon.

N2  - Background Glenoid retroversion may accelerate glenoid loosening after total shoulder arthroplasty. Accurate measurement of preoperative glenoid deformity is critical for decision-making and prognostication. The purpose of this study was to determine whether glenoid version, inclination, and depth and humeral subluxation measurements on computed tomography (CT) scan slices oriented in the plane of the body differ from those oriented in the scapular plane and those obtained by automated 3-dimensional reconstruction software in the setting of a biconcave B2-type glenoid. Methods Thirty-one preoperative CT scans in patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty with Walch B2-type glenoids underwent a standardized measurement protocol by 3 observers. Glenoid version, inclination, and depth and humeral subluxation were measured on 2-dimensional CT images in the plane of the body, on 2-dimensional images in the plane of the scapula, and by a validated, automated 3-dimensional software program. Results Correction of CT slice axis into the plane of the scapula decreased measured retroversion by 2.4° to 4.7° (P < .004) and inclination by 21° (P < .001). Whereas uncorrected version measurements do not differ from automated software measurements, corrected measurements do (P < .001). Whereas corrected inclination measurements do not differ from automated measurements, uncorrected measurements do (P < .001). Automated measurements differed from both corrected and uncorrected subluxation (P < .001 in both cases). Conclusion If CT images are not reoriented into the plane of the scapula, version and inclination will be significantly overestimated. In the setting of a retroverted, deformed glenoid, automated software may produce similar inclination measurements to corrected 2-dimensional CT, but it produces significantly altered measurements of version and subluxation.

N2  - Background & Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of the scapula backward tipping test (SBTT) in detecting the presence of pectoralis minor (PM) tightness and subsequently scapula forward tipping, in a symptomatic population. PM tightness with scapula forward tipping has been described to cause pain and dysfunction in the shoulder region. Methods 30 patients with a diagnosis of shoulder pain were randomly assigned and examined by 2 musculoskeletal physical therapists at a time. The procedure consisted of having the individual lay on the stomach in a neutral head position with palms in the anatomical position. The examiner firmly stabilized the inferior angle of the scapula with one hand and the fingers of the other hand hooked the under surface of the coracoid process. A gentle yet firm pull was imparted in an upward direction to sense tightness and to observe movement of the acromion up to the tragus of the ear. A comparison was made with the other side to sense restriction. Inter-rater reliability was determined using the kappa statistic. Results The SBTT was found to be reproducible between examiners (Kappa = 0.735, SE of kappa = 0.123, 95% confidence interval), with a percentage agreement of 86.67%. Conclusion The SBTT may be incorporated as a simple yet effective test to determine the presence of PM tightness and subsequently scapula forward tipping.

N2  - Cervical spine trauma from sport or traffic collisions can have devastating consequences for individuals and a high societal cost. The precise mechanisms of such injuries are still unknown as investigation is hampered by the difficulty in experimentally replicating the conditions under which these injuries occur. We harness the benefits of computer simulation to report on the creation and validation of i) a generic musculoskeletal model (MASI) for the analyses of cervical spine loading in healthy subjects, and ii) a population-specific version of the model (Rugby Model), for investigating cervical spine injury mechanisms during rugby activities. The musculoskeletal models were created in OpenSim, and validated against in vivo data of a healthy subject and a rugby player performing neck and upper limb movements. The novel aspects of the Rugby Model comprise i) population-specific inertial properties and muscle parameters representing rugby forward players, and ii) a custom scapula-clavicular joint that allows the application of multiple external loads. We confirm the utility of the developed generic and population-specific models via verification steps and validation of kinematics, joint moments and neuromuscular activations during rugby scrummaging and neck functional movements, which achieve results comparable with in vivoand in vitrodata. The Rugby Model was validated and used for the first time to provide insight into anatomical loading and cervical spine injury mechanisms related to rugby, whilst the MASI introduces a new computational tool to allow investigation of spinal injuries arising from other sporting activities, transport, and ergonomic applications. The models used in this study are freely available at simtk.org and allow to integrate in silico analyses with experimental approaches in injury prevention.

N2  - Stabilizing the acromioclavicular joint in the vertical and horizontal planes is challenging, and most current techniques do not reliably achieve this goal. The BiPOD repair is an arthroscopically assisted procedure performed with image intensifier guidance that reconstructs the coracoclavicular ligaments as well as the acromioclavicular ligaments to achieve bidirectional stability. Repair is achieved with a combination of 2-mm FiberTape (Arthrex, Naples, Florida) and 20-mm Poly-Tape (Neoligaments, Leeds, England) to achieve rigid repair, prevent bone abrasion, and promote tissue ingrowth. This study is a prospective review of the first 6 patients treated for high-grade acute acromioclavicular injury with the BiPOD technique. The study included 6 men who were 21 to 36 years old (mean, 27 years). At 6-month follow-up, complications were recorded and radiographic analysis was used to determine the coracoclavicular distance for vertical reduction and the amount of acromioclavicular translation on the Alexander axillary view was used to determine horizontal reduction. One patient had a superficial infection over the tape knot. The difference in coracoclavicular distance between the operated side and the uninvolved side was 9±2 mm preoperatively and 0.3±2 mm at 6-month follow-up. On Alexander axillary view, all 6 patients showed stable reduction, which is defined as a clavicle that is in line with the acromion. The findings show that BiPOD acromioclavicular reconstruction restores bidirectional stability of the acromioclavicular joint at 6 months.

N2  - Objectives. To establish anatomical landmarks for biceps tendon groove localization based on intrinsic anatomical relations and to validate the localization with ultrasonographic measurement. Design. Perspective, observational, single-blinded pilot study. Participants. 25 healthy male and female volunteers ages 24-50 years. Methods. We used two anatomical landmarks, the medial epicondyle vertical line related landmark and the coracoid process landmark. The distance from the groove skin mark to the medial epicondyle vertical line and the coracoid process was measured horizontally and was measured at 0° and 45° of shoulder external rotation, respectively. Results. Medial epicondyle vertical lines were 9.3 mm/21.5 mm medial to the groove at 0°/45° of shoulder external rotation, respectively. Correlation coefficients were 0.04/0.10, 0.32/0.42, and 0.26/0.37 for weight, height, and BMI in 0°/45° of shoulder external rotation, respectively. The distance between the coracoid process and the groove was 44.0 mm/62.2 mm in 0°/45° of shoulder external rotation, respectively. Correlation coefficients were 0.36/0.41, 0.36/0.54, and 0.18/0.12 for weight, height, and BMI in 0°/45° of shoulder external rotation, respectively. Conclusions. The medial epicondyle vertical line and the coracoid process landmark are both useful anatomical landmarks to localize the biceps groove. The anatomical landmark based localization is essentially not correlated with subject's weight, height, or BMI.

N2  - Team handball is a popular sport worldwide that requires numerous throws to be made throughout the course of a game. Because of the upper extremity demands of repetitive throwing, it is possible that fatigue can alter the mechanics of a shot. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of localised fatigue on jump shot kinematics and kinetics. Eleven male team handball players (23.1 ± 3.1 years; 185.1 ± 8.3 cm; 89.7 ± 12.2 kg) volunteered. An electromagnetic tracking system was used to examine the jump shot prior to and following localised fatigue. The fatiguing protocol consisted of throwing a 2.2 kg medicine ball into a rebounder until volitional fatigue. No significant kinematic or kinetic differences were observed following fatigue. Shoulder external rotation was -74.8 ± 14.9° prior to and -79.0 ± 14.7° following fatigue at MER. Scapula, external rotation at ball release (BR) prior to fatigue was -2.2 ± 7.0° and -3.2 ± 11.1° following fatigue. Scapular internal rotation, at maximum shoulder internal rotation (MIR), changed from 18.4 ± 11.2° to 20.4 ± 11.8°. Ball velocity decreased from19.8 m · s-1 to 18.8 m · s-1 (P = 0.12). Accuracy percentage in the pre-fatigue trials was 60.8 ± 14.1% and 52.8 ± 12.7% following fatigue (P = 0.20). While no significant changes were observed, it is possible that other fatiguing protocols that more closely represent the aerobic and throwing demands of the sport may have a greater effect on the kinematics and kinetics of the jump shot.

N2  - Background: Early detection of posterior shoulder dislocation in infants with brachial plexus birth palsy (BPBP) is essential, but it may be difficult to accomplish with physical examination alone. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of shoulder dislocation in patients with BPBP using ultrasound and to identify which physical examination measurements correlated most with dislocation in these patients. Methods: This study was a retrospective review of data obtained in an ultrasound screening program of infants with BPBP born from January 2011 to April 2014. Physical examination included the use of the Active Movement Scale (AMS) and measurement of passive external rotation of the shoulder. Ultrasound measurements included PHHD (percentage of the humeral head displaced posterior to the axis of the scapula) and the alpha angle (intersection of the posterior scapular margin with a line tangential to the humeral head through the glenoid). Shoulder dislocation was defined as both a PHHD of >0.5 and an alpha angle of >30°. Results: Of sixty-six infants who had undergone a total of 118 ultrasound examinations (mean, 1.8; range, 1 to 5), 19 (29%) demonstrated shoulder dislocation with the shoulder positioned in internal rotation; the dislocation was first detected between 2.1 and 10.5 months of age. Infants with a dislocated shoulder demonstrated significantly less mean passive external rotation in adduction (mean, 45.8° versus 71.4°, p < 0.001) and a greater difference between internal rotation and external rotation AMS scores (mean, 5.5-point versus 3.3-point difference, p < 0.001) than those without shoulder dislocation. Passive external rotation in adduction was a better measure for discriminating between dislocation and no dislocation (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.89) than was the difference between internal and external rotation AMS scores (AUC = 0.73). A cutoff of 60 of passive external rotation in adduction (≤60° versus° >60) yielded a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 69%. Conclusions: Shoulder dislocation is common in infants with BPBP; 29% of the infants presenting to our tertiary care center had a dislocation during their first year of life. Ultrasound shoulder screening is appropriate for infants with BPBP. If passive external rotation in adduction is used to determine which infants should undergo ultrasound, ≤60° should be utilized as the criterion to achieve appropriate sensitivity. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

N2  - The aims of our study were to compare the dominant (DOM) and non-dominant (NDOM) shoulders of high-level volleyball athletes and identify possible associations of shoulder adaptations with spike speed (SS) and shoulder pathology. A total of 22 male volleyball players from two teams participating in the first division of the Cypriot championship underwent clinical shoulder tests and simple measurements around their shoulder girdle joints bilaterally. SS was measured with the use of a sports speed radar. Compared with the NDOM side, the DOM scapula was more lateralised, the DOM dorsal capsule demonstrated greater laxity, the DOM dorsal muscles stretching ability was compromised, and the DOM pectoralis muscle was more lengthened. Players with present or past DOM shoulder pain demonstrated greater laxity in their DOM dorsal capsule, tightening of their DOM inferior capsule, and lower SS compared with those without shoulder pain. Dorsal capsule measurements bilaterally were significant predictors of SS. None of the shoulder measurements was associated with team roles or infraspinatus atrophy, while scapular lateralisation was more pronounced with increasing years of experience, and scapular antetilting was greater with increasing age. Adaptations of the DOM shoulder may be linked to pathology and performance. We describe simple shoulder measurements that may have the potential to predict chronic shoulder injury and become part of injury prevention programmes. Detailed biomechanical and large prospective studies are warranted to assess the validity of our findings and reach more definitive conclusions.

N2  - Background: There are limited data available regarding the results of reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We performed a systematic review of the literature to investigate the radiological and clinical outcomes after RSA in patients with RA. Methods: A literature search for publications between 1987 and 2014 was conducted by 2 independent reviewers using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Articles were retrieved by an electronic search using keywords and their combinations. Studies that met inclusion criteria were assessed for pertinent data. Results: Seven studies including 123 shoulders met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was 67.9 years and the mean follow-up period was 46.6 months. The mean Constant score and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score increased from 18.6 and 27.5 preoperatively to 58.6 and 73.7, respectively, at the final follow-up evaluation. The mean active forward flexion, abduction, and external rotation increased from 57.2°, 50.4°, and 11.4° to 127.1°, 116.7°, and 26.4°, respectively. The incidence of scapular notching was 33.7%. Twenty-seven (22.0%) of 123 shoulders had one or more complications, 12 of which (44.4%) had intraoperative or postoperative fractures. Nine shoulders (7.3%) had one or more revision surgeries. Conclusions: RSA in RA showed similar short- to mid-term results without higher complication rates as compared to RSA in cuff tear arthropathy. Although RSA can be considered a reliable treatment option in patients with RA, further large-scale studies are required to determine the long-term survival of the implant.

N2  - Background. External impingement tests are considered as being particularly reliable for identifying subacromial and coracoid shoulder impingement mechanisms. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate if these tests are likely to provoke an internal shoulder impingement mechanism which, in cases of a pathologic condition, can lead to a positive test result. Method. In 37 subjects, the mechanical contact between the glenoid rim and the rotator cuff (RC) was measured quantitatively and qualitatively in external impingement test positions using an open MRI system. Results. Mechanical contact of the supraspinatus with the posterosuperior glenoid was present in 30 subjects in the Neer test. In the Hawkins test, the subscapularis was in contact with the anterosuperior glenoid in 33 subjects and the supraspinatus in 18. In the horizontal impingement test, anterosuperior contact of the supraspinatus with the glenoid was identified in 35 subjects. Conclusion. The Neer, Hawkins, and horizontal impingement tests are likely to provoke the mechanism of an internal shoulder impingement. A posterosuperior internal impingement mechanism is being provoked predominately in the Neer test. The Hawkins test narrows the distance between the insertions of the subscapularis and supraspinatus and the anterosuperior labrum, which leads to an anterosuperior impingement mechanism.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Inconsistencies in the literature concerning the effect of neck pain have led to a lack of understanding concerning the complete pathophysiology of neck pain. While the effect of neck pain on motor function as measured by active range of motion and isometric neck strength is well documented the effect of neck pain on sensory measures such as tactical acuity and neck reposition error (NRE) remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a combined sensorimotor evaluation to explore the potential benefits of incorporating both sensory and motor task into a physical evaluation of neck pain suffers to gain an added knowledge of the complete pathophysiology of their health status. METHODS: A cross-sectional study that measured neck joint reposition error, tactical acuity, neck isometric strength and range of motion in 40 volunteer participants (22 pain, 18 control). RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in NRE in flexion (2.75° ± 1.52° vs. 4.53° ± 1.74°and in extension (3.78° ± 1.95° vs 5.77° ± 2.73° in participants suffering from neck pain was observed. Additionally, the dermatome C5 was found to be the most affected. No differences were found in neck strength or neck range of motion between healthy controls and patients with chronic moderate neck pain.

N2  - Background: Deviant shoulder girdle movement is suggested as an eminent factor in the etiology of shoulder pain. Reliable measurements of shoulder girdle kinematics are a prerequisite for optimizing clinical management strategies.
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability, measurement error, and internal consistency of measurements with performance-based clinical tests for shoulder girdle kinematics and positioning in patients with shoulder pain.
Data Sources: The MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases were systematically searched from inception to August 2015.
Study Selection: Articles published in Dutch, English, or German were included if they involved the evaluation of at least one of the measurement properties of interest.
Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently evaluated the methodological quality per studied measurement property with the 4-point-rating scale of the COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) checklist, extracted data, and assessed the adequacy of the measurement properties.
Data Synthesis: Forty studies comprising more than 30 clinical tests were included. Actual reported measurements of the tests were categorized into: (1) positional measurement methods, (2) measurement methods to determine dynamic characteristics, and (3) tests to diagnose impairments of shoulder girdle function. Best evidence synthesis of the tests was performed per measurement for each measurement property.
Limitations: All studies had significant limitations, including incongruence between test description and actual reported measurements and a lack of reporting on minimal important change. In general, the methodological quality of the selected studies was fair to poor.
Conclusions: High-quality evidence indicates that measurements obtained with the Modified Scapular Assistance Test are not reliable for clinical use. Sound recommendations for the use of other tests could not be made due to inadequate evidence. Across studies, diversity in description, performance, and interpretation of similar tests was present, and different criteria were used to establish similar diagnoses, mostly without taking into account a clinically meaningful context. Consequently, these tests lack face validity, which hampers their clinical use. Further research on validity and how to integrate a clinically meaningful context of movement into clinical tests is warranted.

N2  - Severe glenoid deformity with bone loss presents a significant challenge in shoulder reconstructive surgery. In the context of reverse arthroplasty achieving ideal glenoid baseplate position, specifically the maintenance of an appropriately lateralized joint center of rotation, will generally result in a large residual bone defect in these cases. Addressing this with primary structural bone grafting from the humeral head is a reliable treatment option with the advantage of restoring bone stock. Shaping and fixing the graft can be a difficult, time consuming, and somewhat inaccurate process of trial and error. Achieving optimal glenosphere position and fixation is also challenging due to the limited bone stock available and disorientation due to anatomic deformity. We present a novel bone graft preparation technique that allows expeditious ex vivo graft fashioning using a custom 3-dimensional plastic model of the glenoid as a template. In our series of 7 shoulders, integration of humeral head autograft was noted in all shoulders at a mean follow-up of 16 months. Patient-specific instrumentation is utilized both to construct the model and ensure optimal positioning of the glenoid prosthesis and the graft.

N2  - Purpose To validate the glenoid track concept in a cadaveric bipolar bone loss model and to test whether “on-track” and “off-track” lesions can be stabilized with Bankart repair (BR) with or without Hill-Sachs remplissage (HSR). Methods Eight fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were tested in a custom apparatus with passive axial rotation and then progressive translational loading (10 to 40 N) at mid-range (60°) and end-range external rotation (90°). Injury conditions included glenoid bone loss of 15% with on-track (15%) and off-track (30%) Hill-Sachs lesions. Repair conditions included BR with HSR and BR without HSR. Results For on-track lesions, engagement occurred with translation testing in one shoulder (12.5%) at end-range rotation. After BR, engagement was prevented for this shoulder. For off-track lesions, engagement with translation testing occurred in 8 shoulders (100%) at end-range rotation and in 6 (75%) at mid-range rotation. After BR, engagement was prevented in 4 of 6 engaging shoulders (67%) at mid-range rotation but was prevented in zero of 8 (0%) at end-range rotation. Adding HSR prevented engagement in all 14 engaging shoulders with off-track lesions (100%). BR with HSR resulted in supraphysiological stiffness for off-track lesions at mid- and end-range rotation (13.3 N/m vs 7.0 N/m and 10.0 N/m vs 5.0 N/m, P =.0002) and for on-track lesions at end-range rotation (10.1 N/m vs 5.0 N/m, P =.0002). Stiffness of BR with HSR was not different from the intact shoulder for on-track lesions at mid-range rotation (7.2 N/m vs 7.0 N/m, P >.99). Conclusions The patterns of engagement of Hill-Sachs lesions with a 15% glenoid defect in this model give support to the glenoid track concept. BR plus remplissage resulted in supraphysiological shoulder stiffness but was necessary to prevent engagement of off-track bipolar bone lesions. Clinical Relevance This biomechanical study provides evidence to aid in surgical decision making by examining the effects of bipolar bone loss and soft-tissue reconstruction on shoulder stability.

N2  - Background Plain radiographs still play a role in management of extraarticular scapular neck fractures. Glenopolar angle (GPA) is one of the radiograph measurements that is used to determine the necessity for surgery. Our aim was to establish reliability of GPA on plain radiograph in patients with extraarticular scapular neck fractures. Methods We performed a multicentre retrospective study including all patients with extraarticular scapular neck fractures with available imaging between 2006 and 2012. We excluded intra-articular glenoid fractures, scapular blade fractures, acromion fractures, and scapular spine fractures. We compared GPA on plain radiograph with three dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) measurement, as well as contribution of radiograph rotational error, glenoid inclination, and medial shortening of glenoid fragment towards GPA measurement. Results One hundred patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean difference between the GPA measurements on radiographs and 3D CT was 6.1 ± 0.85° (95% confidence interval) as an absolute value. In terms of contribution to GPA values, GPA changed by one degree with ten degrees of radiograph rotational error, three degrees of glenoid inclination, and three millimetres of glenoid fragment medial shortening. Conclusion Plain radiograph can provide a clinician with a reasonable estimation of the GPA. Glenoid inclination has a greater influence on GPA compared to medial shortening.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study compared the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic remplissage with Bankart repair and Latarjet operation in patients with a large engaging Hill-Sachs lesion.
METHODS: Thirty-seven shoulders subjected to arthroscopic remplissage with a Bankart repair (group A) and 35 shoulders subjected to a Latarjet operation (group B), for a large engaging Hill-Sachs lesion without significant glenoid bone loss, were retrospectively evaluated. Each group was followed up for a mean more than 2-year period.
RESULTS: At the last follow-up, postoperative pain, shoulder mobility, muscle strength, Rowe score, and UCLA score revealed no significant difference between the two groups. The postoperative mean deficit in external rotation at the side (ERs) was 8° ± 23° in group A (P = 0.044). In group B, the mean deficits in ERs, external rotation at 90° of abduction, and internal rotation to the posterior were 10° ± 20°, 7° ± 16°, and 1.9° ± 4°, respectively (P = 0.004, 0.022, and 0.009, respectively). The recurrence rate was 5.4 % (two shoulders) in group A and 5.7 % (two shoulders) in group B (n.s.). The overall complication rate was significantly higher in group B (14.3 %) than in group A (0 %) (P = 0.017).
CONCLUSIONS: For recurrent anterior shoulder instability with a large engaging Hill-Sachs lesion, both arthroscopic remplissage with Bankart repair and the Latarjet procedure were safe and reliable techniques with a low recurrence rate. However, the Latarjet group had a significantly higher postoperative complication rate than the remplissage group.

N2  - Background: Conservative and even surgical management of adhesive capsulitis often is prolonged and painful. Management of adhesive capsulitis is lacking evidence-based controlled clinical trials. Questions/Purposes: We asked: (1) Does a collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection lyse shoulder capsule collagen in adhesive capsulitis and at what dose? (2) Can a shoulder capsule injection be administered extraarticularly? (3) Do CCH injections result in better scores for pain and function than can be achieved with physical therapy among patients with adhesive capsulitis? Methods: First, 60 patients with adhesive capsulitis were evaluated by clinical examination. To make the diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis, a patient had to have restricted active ROM of at least 60° in total active ROM in the affected shoulder compared with the unaffected contralateral shoulder; with the scapula stabilized, external rotation with the elbow at the side was a very important determinant. Patients were randomized to receive a single injection of 0.5 mL placebo or 0.145, 0.29, or 0.58 mg CCH. All 60 patients were followed up at 30 days. After that, if patients did not attain treatment thresholds they were eligible for up to five open-label 0.58-mg collagenase injections. For the longer-term followup in the open-label phase, 53 patients (83%) were followed to 12 months, 46 (77%) for 24 months, 36 (60%) for 36 months, 37 (62%) for 48 months, and 25 (42%) for 60 months. The extraarticular injection was directed at the anterior shoulder capsule with the patient in the supine position. To prove that these injections could be delivered reliably to the anterior shoulder capsule extraarticularly, the next study involved volunteers without adhesive capsulitis, in which 10 volunteers received a 10-mL injection of normal saline under ultrasound guidance. Finally, to determine the efficacy and dosing of CCH, four cohorts of 10 patients received up to three ultrasound-guided injections separated by 21 days. These injections were administered at one of four dose-volume levels. A fifth cohort of 10 patients was used as a control group and performed standardized home shoulder exercises only. All patients performed standardized home shoulder exercises three times daily. For Study 3, followup was at 22, 43, 64, and 92 days. No patients were lost to followup. Results: In the first study, a single CCH injection did not provide clinically important improvements from baseline in active ROM, passive ROM, and function and pain scores compared with patients who received placebo. Ultrasound guidance confirmed extraarticular injection of the shoulder capsule in Study 2. The CCH injection was more effective than exercise therapy alone at 0.58 mg/1 mL and 0.58 mg/2 mL compared with exercise only in the primary measure of efficacy (active forward flexion) as shown in Study 3. For active forward flexion the mean in degrees in the 0.58 mg/2 mL group was 38° compared with 12° in the exercise-only group (p = 0.03). For active forward flexion the mean in the 0.58 mg/1mL group was 43° compared with 12° in the exercise-only group (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Extraarticular injections of CCH for treatment of adhesive capsulitis were well tolerated and seem effective compared with exercise therapy. Future FDA-regulated clinical trials must verify CCH injection therapy for adhesive capsulitis. Level of Evidence: Level II, therapeutic study.

N2  - Background The strength of the shoulder protractors and retractors may be compromised in individuals with winged scapula (IwWS). However, no standard approach to measuring the strength of these muscles has been described. The aim of this study was to study the intra-rater and inter-rater reproducibility of a fixed-base isometric dynamometer and to describe cutoff scores for clinically meaningful change for protraction and retraction isometric strength. Method Twice during a week, 20 normal subjects and 20 IwWS were tested by 2 independent raters. Results IwWS were significantly weaker (P < .001) than control subjects in their protraction and retraction isometric strength. Excellent intra-rater and inter-rater correlations were obtained in most combinations, leading to low cutoff scores for meaningful change expressed in terms of the smallest real difference. Conclusion When it is properly used, the technique described in this paper is recommended as an effective clinical tool for the quantitative assessment of protraction and retraction isometric strength, both for status determination and for monitoring of change in IwWS during and after rehabilitation.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of a minimally invasive surgical technique for the treatment of patients with acromioclavicular joint dislocation. Methods: Sixteen patients with complete acromioclavicular joint dislocation were enrolled in this study. All patients were asked to follow the less active rehabilitation protocol post-operatively. Computed tomography with 3-D reconstruction of the injured shoulder was performed on each patient post operatively for the assessment of the accuracy of the suture anchor placement in the coracoid process and the reduction of the acromioclavicular joint. Radiographs of Zanca view and axillary view of both shoulders were taken for evaluating the maintenance of the acromioclavicular joint reduction at each follow-up visit. The Constant shoulder score was used for function assessment at the final follow-up. Results: Twenty seven of the 32 anchors implanted in the coracoid process met the criteria of good position. One patient developed complete loss of reduction and another had partial loss of reduction in the anteroposterior plane. For the other 14 patients, the mean Constant score was 90 (range, 82–95). For the patients with partial and complete loss of reduction, the Constant score were 92 and 76 respectively. All of them got nearly normal range of motion of the shoulders and restored to pre-operative life and works. Conclusion: With this minimally invasive approach and limited exposure of the coracoid, a surgeon can place the suture anchors at the anatomical insertions of the coracoclavicular ligament and allow the dislocated joint reduced and maintained well. Level of evidence: Level IV, Case series; therapeutic study.

N2  - Hypothesis The objective of the study was to evaluate the development of scapular notching in reverse shoulder arthroplasty by comparing larger glenospheres (42 mm) with smaller glenospheres (38 mm). Methods This was a prospective randomized study of 81 patients who had undergone reverse shoulder arthroplasty with a 2-year follow-up. Patients were randomized to receive either a 42-mm glenosphere (38 patients) or a 38-mm glenosphere (43 patients). Scapular notching development was assessed with an anteroposterior radiograph at the end of the follow-up. Functional outcome was assessed with the Constant score before surgery and at the end of follow-up. An independent blinded observer carried out radiologic and clinical assessments. Results Scapular notching was present in 48.8% of the patients receiving a 38-mm glenosphere and in 12.1% of the patients receiving one of 42 mm, with significant differences between both (P < .001). No significant differences were noted between the 2 glenosphere size groups in terms of the total Constant score. Patients with a 42-mm glenosphere had a mean glenoid-glenosphere overhang of 6.1 mm, whereas patients with a 38-mm glenosphere had one of 4.2 mm, with significant differences between them (P < .001). No significant differences in the total Constant score were found between the patients whether they had scapular notching or not. Conclusion Bigger glenospheres (42 mm) significantly reduce development of scapular notching compared with smaller glenospheres (38 mm). Glenosphere size has no significant influence on functional outcomes measured with the Constant score.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Anatomic studies have demonstrated that bipolar glenoid and humeral bone loss have a cumulative effect on shoulder instability and that these defects may engage in functional positions depending on their size and location, potentially resulting in failure of stabilization procedures. Determining which lesions pose a risk for engagement remains challenging, with arthroscopic assessments and a 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT)-based glenoid track method being accepted approaches at this time.
PURPOSE: The purpose was to investigate the interaction of humeral and glenoid bone defects on shoulder engagement in a cadaveric model. Two alternative approaches to predicting engagement were evaluated: (1) CT of the shoulder in abduction and external rotation (ABER) and (2) measurement of the glenoid lesion width and measurement of a novel parameter, the intact anterior articular angle (IAAA), on conventional 2-dimensional multiplane reformats.
STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.
METHODS: Hill-Sachs and glenoid defects of varying sizes were created in 12 cadaveric upper limbs, producing 45 bipolar defect combinations. The defect characteristics were assessed using CT with the shoulder in a neutral position. ABER CT was performed with the shoulder positioned in 60° of glenohumeral abduction (corresponding to 90° of abduction relative to the trunk) and 90° of external rotation. The IAAA was measured as the cartilage arc angle anterior to the Hill-Sachs defect on the axial slice bisecting the humeral head. The performance of the ABER CT and IAAA approaches to predicting engagement were compared with the glenoid track method.
RESULTS: Of the 45 defect combinations, 24 (53%) were classified as engaging using the glenoid track method. ABER CT predicted engagement accurately in 43 of 45 (96%), with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 100%, respectively. A logistic model based on the glenoid defect width and IAAA provided a prediction accuracy of 87%, with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 81%, respectively.
CONCLUSION/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Bipolar lesions at risk for engagement can be identified accurately using an ABER CT scan or by performing 2-dimensional measurements of the glenoid defect width and IAAA on conventional CT multiplane reformats. This information will be useful for surgical planning in the setting of bipolar bone defects before shoulder stabilization.

N2  - Forelimb morphology is an indicator for terrestrial locomotor ecology. The limb morphology of the enigmatic tapir (Perissodactyla: Tapirus) has often been compared to that of basal perissodactyls, despite the lack of quantitative studies comparing forelimb variation in modern tapirs. Here, we present a quantitative assessment of tapir upper forelimb osteology using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to test whether the four modern tapir species are monomorphic in their forelimb skeleton. The shape of the upper forelimb bones across four species (T. indicus; T. bairdii; T. terrestris; T. pinchaque) was investigated. Bones were laser scanned to capture surface morphology and 3D landmark analysis was used to quantify shape. Discriminant function analyses were performed to reveal features which could be used for interspecific discrimination. Overall our results show that the appendicular skeleton contains notable interspecific differences. We demonstrate that upper forelimb bones can be used to discriminate between species (>91% accuracy), with the scapula proving the most diagnostic bone (100% accuracy). Features that most successfully discriminate between the four species include the placement of the cranial angle of the scapula, depth of the humeral condyle, and the caudal deflection of the olecranon. Previous studies comparing the limbs of T. indicus and T. terrestris are corroborated by our quantitative findings. Moreover, the mountain tapir T. pinchaque consistently exhibited the greatest divergence in morphology from the other three species. Despite previous studies describing tapirs as functionally mediportal in their locomotor style, we find osteological evidence suggesting a spectrum of locomotor adaptations in the tapirs. We conclude that modern tapir forelimbs are neither monomorphic nor are tapirs as conserved in their locomotor habits as previously described. J.

N2  - Introduction There is disagreement regarding whether, when possible, the rotator cuff should be repaired in conjunction with reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). Therefore, we investigated the effects of rotator cuff repair in RTSA models with varying magnitudes of humeral and glenosphere lateralization. Methods Six fresh frozen cadaveric shoulders were tested on a validated in vitro muscle-driven motion simulator. Each specimen was implanted with a custom adjustable, load-sensing RTSA after creation of a simulated rotator cuff tear. The effects of 4 RTSA configurations (0 and 10 mm of humeral lateralization and glenosphere lateralization) on deltoid force and joint load during abduction with and without rotator cuff repair were assessed. Results Deltoid force was significantly affected by increasing humeral lateralization (−2.5% ± 1.7% body weight [BW], P = .016) and glenosphere lateralization (+7.7% ± 5.6% BW, P = .016). Rotator cuff repair interacted with humeral and glenosphere lateralization (P = .005), such that with no humeral lateralization, glenosphere lateralization increased deltoid force without cuff repair (8.1% ± 5.1% BW, P = .012). This effect was increased with cuff repair (12.8% ± 7.8% BW, P = .010), but the addition of humeral lateralization mitigated this effect. Rotator cuff repair increased joint load (+11.9% ± 5.1% BW, P = .002), as did glenosphere lateralization (+13.3% ± 3.7% BW, P < .001). These interacted, such that increasing glenosphere lateralization markedly increased the negative effects of cuff repair (9.4% ± 3.2% BW [P = .001] vs. 14.4% ± 7.4% BW [P = .005]). Conclusion Rotator cuff repair, especially in conjunction with glenosphere lateralization, produces an antagonistic effect that increases deltoid and joint loading. The long-term effects of this remain unknown; however, combining these factors may prove undesirable. Humeral lateralization improves joint compression through deltoid wrapping and increases the deltoid's mechanical advantage, and therefore, could be used in place of rotator cuff repair, thus avoiding its complications.

N2  - Background: The utilization of musculoskeletal ultrasound has expanded within the setting of the orthopedic clinic as a cost-effective, point-of-care diagnostic tool for shoulder pathology. In experienced hands, ultrasound exhibits capabilities equivalent to that of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of many shoulder diseases including full-thickness and partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. Although similarly effective in identifying additional shoulder disease processes, major obstacles to its widespread use include user dependence and intrinsic limitation to extra-articular diagnosis. Objectives: The purpose of this review is to present a step-by-step guide of how to perform a comprehensive shoulder examination and to discuss the appropriate use, economic benefit and implementation of ultrasound within the clinic. Methods: A systematic search (June 2016) of PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE databases was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for literature presenting shoulder ultrasound examination protocols. Included studies were peer-reviewed articles or academic society endorsed protocols presenting comprehensive sonographic examinations of the adult shoulder. Papers with limited or single structure examination descriptions, non-English language, and publication dates before 1980 were excluded. Final papers meeting criteria were secondarily screened for publication after 2005 to reflect the current state of ultrasound imaging. Results and Conclusions: The search yielded 1,725 unique articles with 17 studies meeting final selection criteria. Information from identified studies was summarized to formulate a 4-part shoulder examination protocol, including steps most pertinent to orthopedic in-office diagnoses. In agreement with previous studies, the inexperienced orthopedic surgeon can be quickly trained to expert level proficiency in shoulder ultrasound diagnosis. Using an established protocol, a comprehensive, yet effective shoulder ultrasound examination can be performed within ten minutes. Further, ultrasound provides opportunity to off-set costs through the engagement of revenue generating activity for the orthopedic practice.

N2  - Purpose: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging plays a key role in investigating early degenerative disorders and traumatic injuries of the glenohumeral cartilages. Subtle morphometric and biochemical changes of potential relevance to clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and evaluation can be assessed from measurements derived from in vivo MR segmentation of the cartilages. However, segmentation of the glenohumeral cartilages, using approaches spanning manual to automated methods, is technically challenging, due to their thin, curved structure and overlapping intensities of surrounding tissues. Automatic segmentation of the glenohumeral cartilages from MR imaging is not at the same level compared to the weight-bearing knee and hip joint cartilages despite the potential applications with respect to clinical investigation of shoulder disorders. In this work, the authors present a fully automated segmentation method for the glenohumeral cartilages using MR images of healthy shoulders. Methods: The method involves automated segmentation of the humerus and scapula bones using 3D active shape models, the extraction of the expected bone-cartilage interface, and cartilage segmentation using a graph-based method. The cartilage segmentation uses localization, patient specific tissue estimation, and a model of the cartilage thickness variation. The accuracy of this method was experimentally validated using a leave-one-out scheme on a database of MR images acquired from 44 asymptomatic subjects with a true fast imaging with steady state precession sequence on a 3 T scanner (Siemens Trio) using a dedicated shoulder coil. The automated results were compared to manual segmentations from two experts (an experienced radiographer and an experienced musculoskeletal anatomist) using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and mean absolute surface distance (MASD) metrics. Results: Accurate and precise bone segmentations were achieved with mean DSC of 0.98 and 0.93 for the humeral head and glenoid fossa, respectively. Mean DSC scores of 0.74 and 0.72 were obtained for the humeral and glenoid cartilage volumes, respectively. The manual interobserver reliability evaluated by DSC was 0.80±0.03 and 0.76±0.04 for the two cartilages, implying that the automated results were within an acceptable 10% difference. The MASD between the automatic and the corresponding manual cartilage segmentations was less than 0.4 mm (previous studies reported mean cartilage thickness of 1.3 mm). Conclusions: This work shows the feasibility of volumetric segmentation and separation of the glenohumeral cartilages from MR images. To their knowledge, this is the first fully automated algorithm for volumetric segmentation of the individual glenohumeral cartilages from MR images. The approach was validated against manual segmentations from experienced analysts. In future work, the approach will be validated on imaging datasets acquired with various MR contrasts in patients.

N2  - In this study, we aimed to determine if electromyography (EMG) normalization to maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) was infuenced by subacromial pain in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome. Patients performed MVICs in unique testing positions for each shoulder muscle tested before and after subacromial injection of local anesthetic. In addition to collection of MVIC data, EMG data during an arm elevation task were recorded before and after injection. From a visual analog pain scale, patients had a 64% decrease in pain following the injection. Significant increases in MVICs were noted in 4 of the 7 shoulder muscles tested: anterior, middle and posterior deltoid, and lower trapezius. No significant differences were noticed for the upper trapezius, latissimus dorsi, or serratus anterior. MVIC condition (pre and post injection) had a significant influence on EMG normalization for the anterior deltoid and lower trapezius muscle. Results indicate that subacromial pain can influence shoulder muscle activity, especially for the deltoid muscles and lower trapezius. In addition, normalization to MVIC in the presence of pain can have unpredictable results. Caution should be taken when normalizing EMG data to MVIC in the presence of pain.

N2  - Objectives: The bony shoulder stability ratio (BSSR) allows for quantification of the bony stabilisers in vivo. We aimed to biomechanically validate the BSSR, determine whether joint incongruence affects the stability ratio (SR) of a shoulder model, and determine the correct parameters (glenoid concavity versus humeral head radius) for calculation of the BSSR in vivo. Methods: Four polyethylene balls (radii: 19.1 mm to 38.1 mm) were used to mould four fitting sockets in four different depths (3.2 mm to 19.1mm). The SR was measured in biomechanical congruent and incongruent experimental series. The experimental SR of a congruent system was compared with the calculated SR based on the BSSR approach. Differences in SR between congruent and incongruent experimental conditions were quantified. Finally, the experimental SR was compared with either calculated SR based on the socket concavity or plastic ball radius. Results: The experimental SR is comparable with the calculated SR (mean difference 10%, sd 8%; relative values). The experimental incongruence study observed almost no differences (2%, sd 2%). The calculated SR on the basis of the socket concavity radius is superior in predicting the experimental SR (mean difference 10%, sd 9%) compared with the calculated SR based on the plastic ball radius (mean difference 42%, sd 55%). Conclusion: The present biomechanical investigation confirmed the validity of the BSSR. Incongruence has no significant effect on the SR of a shoulder model. In the event of an incongruent system, the calculation of the BSSR on the basis of the glenoid concavity radius is recommended.

N2  - Cadaveric experiments were undertaken to validate a finite element (FE) modeling approach for studying impingement-related scapular notching in reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). The specific focus of the validation was contact at the site of impingement between the humeral polyethylene component and the inferior aspect of the scapula during an adduction motion. Lateralization of the RSA center of rotation was varied because it has been advocated clinically to reduce impingement and presumably decrease the risk of scapular notching. Tekscan sensors were utilized to directly measure contact stress at the impingement site, and FE was used to compute contact stresses. Favorable agreement was seen between physically measured and FE-computed impingement site location (within one sensing element of the Tekscan sensor) and contact loads (mean absolute difference of 14.9%). Contact stresses and contact areas were difficult to compare directly due to the disparate spatial resolutions of the Tekscan sensor and the FE model. FE-computed contact at the impingement site was highly focal, with a total contact area comparable to the area of an individual Tekscan sensing element. The good agreement between the physically measured and FE-computed contact data (i.e., contact load and location) support the use of FE modeling as a tool for computationally testing the efficacy of changing various surgical variables associated with RSA.

N2  - Objectives: Investigate reliability of shoulder internal and external rotation (IR, ER), abduction in internal rotation (ABIR) and combined elevation (CE) range of motion tests in competitive swimmers. Design: Within participants, inter- and intra-examiner reliability. Setting: Physiotherapy Department, University of Melbourne, Australia. Participants: 17 competitive swimmers (aged 12-24 years) who participate in at least 5 weekly swimming sessions and two physiotherapy examiners. Main outcome measures: Inter- and intra-examiner reliability of IR, ER, ABIR and CE. Results: Good to excellent intra-examiner reliability across tests (ICCs: 0.85-0.96) with standard error of measurement (SEM)and minimal detectable change at 90% confidence interval (MDC90) ranging from 2 to 5, and 5-12°, respectively. Good to excellent inter-examiner reliability for all tests (ICCs: 0.77-0.94) except left IR (ICC: 0.65). Inter-examiner SEM and MDC90 ranged from 2 to 5° and 5-12°, respectively. Conclusion: Shoulder range of motion tests were reliable when applied by the same examiner. Inter-examiner reliability was acceptable for all tests except IR, which was affected by inconsistent manual scapula stabilisation between examiners.

N2  - Background: The proximal humerus represents one of the most common sites for primary malignant bone tumors. Limb salvage procedures have become the standard modality in treatment of these tumors. Several techniques can be used in shoulder reconstruction after wide resection of malignant bone tumors. The purpose of this study was to compare the functional outcome and complications for two important methods of shoulder joint reconstruction: conventional arthrodesis using fibular autogenous graft and clavicula pro humero. Methods: We retrospectively studied 30 patients with malignant tumors of the proximal humerus treated with limb salvage procedures with mean follow-up period of 67.16 mo. In 13 we used the clavicula pro humerus technique for reconstruction, and in 17 we performed conventional shoulder arthrodesis using nonvascularized fibular graft. Results: The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Score (MSTS) for the conventional shoulder arthrodesis group was 69.6%. For the clavicula-pro-humero group the score was 67.5%. The Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) for the conventional shoulder arthrodesis group was 34.6, while for the clavicula-pro-humero group it was 36.8. The median time to union was 8 wk for both groups. Conclusions: Both techniques represent reliable methods of shoulder reconstruction after wide resection of malignant tumors with comparable functional outcome and complications rates.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Shoulder complaints are frequently encountered in general practice, but precise diagnosing is challenging. This study investigated agreement of shoulder complaints diagnoses between clinicians in a primary health care setting.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Four primary health care clinicians used patients' history and functional examination of the shoulder by selective tissue tension techniques (STTs), to diagnose shoulder complaints.
SUBJECTS: 62 patients, aged 18-75 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reliability of diagnoses was assessed by observed intertester agreement and Cohen's kappa. A total of 372 diagnostic pairs were available for intertester comparisons.
RESULTS: Six diagnoses were assigned by all clinicians; supraspinatus-, infraspinatus-, subscapularis-tendinopathies; chronic subacromial bursitis; glenohumeral capsulitis, and acromioclavicular joint lesion. The observed agreement on these diagnoses ranged from 0.84 for glenohumeral capsulitis to 0.97 for acromioclavicular joint lesion. Kappa scores were 0.46 (95% CI 0.33, 0.58) for chronic subacromial bursitis; 0.53 (95% CI 0.34, 0.68), 0.59 (95% CI 0.47, 0.70), and 0.68 (95% CI 0.53, 0.82) for infraspinatus -, supraspinatus -, and subscapularis-tendinopathy, respectively. For glenohumeral capsulitis and acromioclavicular lesion kappa scores were 0.66 (95% CI 0.57, 0.73) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.61, 0.90). Kappa scores were higher for individual diagnoses than for individual tests, except for limitation in passive abduction (0.70, 95% CI 0.62, 0.78) and passive lateral rotation (0.66, 95% CI 0.57, 0.73).
CONCLUSIONS: Although experienced clinicians showed substantial intertester agreement, precise diagnoses of shoulder complaints in primary health care remain a challenge. The present results call for further research on refined diagnoses of shoulder complaints. Key points   Based on medical history and a systematic functional examination by selective tissue tension techniques (STTs), we investigated the agreement of shoulder complaints diagnoses across four primary health care clinicians and 62 patients. • Agreements on diagnoses were generally better than the agreement on individual tests. • Good kappa scores were obtained for the diagnoses glenohumeral capsulitis, rotator cuff tendinopathy, and acromioclavicular lesion. • Further research is necessary to investigate the diagnostic validity of functional shoulder examination by the STTs method.

N2  - The movements of the humerus, the clavicle, and the scapula are not completely independent. The coupled pattern of movement of these bones is called the shoulder rhythm. To date, multiple studies have focused on providing regression-based 3-D shoulder rhythms, in which the orientations of the clavicle and the scapula are estimated by the orientation of the humerus. In this study, six existing regression-based shoulder rhythms were evaluated by an independent dataset in terms of their predictability. The datasets include the measured orientations of the humerus, the clavicle, and the scapula of 14 participants over 118 different upper arm postures. The predicted orientations of the clavicle and the scapula were derived from applying those regression-based shoulder rhythms to the humerus orientation. The results indicated that none of those regression-based shoulder rhythms provides consistently more accurate results than the others. For all the joint angles and all the shoulder rhythms, the RMSE are all greater than 5°. Among those shoulder rhythms, the scapula lateral/medial rotation has the strongest correlation between the predicted and the measured angles, while the other thoracoclavicular and thoracoscapular bone orientation angles only showed a weak to moderate correlation. Since the regression-based shoulder rhythm has been adopted for shoulder biomechanical models to estimate shoulder muscle activities and structure loads, there needs to be further investigation on how the predicted error from the shoulder rhythm affects the output of the biomechanical model.

N2  - Superior humeral head translation and scapula reorientation can reduce the subacromial space. While these kinematic abnormalities exist in injured populations, the effect of muscle fatigue is unclear. Additionally, these mechanisms were typically studied independently, thereby neglecting potential covariance. This research evaluated the influence of upper extremity muscle fatigue on glenohumeral and scapulothoracic kinematics and defined their relationship. Radiography and motion tracking systems captured these kinematic relationships, during scapula plane elevation, both before and after fatigue. Fatigue-induced changes in humeral head position, scapular orientation and the minimum subacromial space width were measured. High inter-subject variability existed for each measure which precluded identification of mean differences at the population level. However, significant scapular upward rotation occurred following fatigue (p = 0.0002). Despite similar population mean results, between 39% and 57% of participants exhibited fatigue-related changes in disadvantageous orientations. Additionally, correlations between measures were generally fair (0.21–0.40) and highly dependent on elevation, likely attributed to the variable fatigue responses. Overall, the data confirms that fatigue-induced changes in kinematics poses highly variable risk of subacromial impingement syndrome across individuals. Thus, solely considering the “average” or mean population response likely underestimates potentially injurious fatigue consequences.

N2  - Rotator cuff (RC) tears may be associated with increased glenohumeral instability; however, this instability is difficult to quantify using currently available diagnostic tools. Recently, the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and registration method of the scapula and humeral head, based on sequences of low-dose biplane X-ray images, has been proposed for glenohumeral displacement assessment. This research aimed to evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of this technique and to investigate its potential with a preliminary application comparing RC tear patients and asymptomatic volunteers. Accuracy was assessed using CT scan model registration on biplane X-ray images for five cadaveric shoulder specimens and showed differences ranging from 0.6 to 1.4 mm depending on the direction of interest. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility was assessed through two operators who repeated the reconstruction of five subjects three times, allowing defining 95% confidence interval ranging from ±1.8 to ±3.6 mm. Intraclass correlation coefficient varied between 0.84 and 0.98. Comparison between RC tear patients and asymptomatic volunteers showed differences of glenohumeral displacements, especially in the superoinferior direction when shoulder was abducted at 20° and 45°. This study thus assessed the accuracy of the low-dose 3D biplane X-ray reconstruction technique for glenohumeral displacement assessment and showed potential in biomechanical and clinical research.

N2  - Objectives: Overhead athletic activities and scapula dyskinesia are linked with shoulder pathology; pull-ups are a common training method for some overhead sports. Different pull-up techniques exist: anecdotally some are easier to perform, and others linked to greater incidences of pathology. This study aims to quantify scapular kinematics and external forces for three pull-up techniques, thus discussing potential injury implications. Design: An observational study was performed with eleven participants (age = 26.8 ± 2.4 years) who regularly perform pull-ups. Methods: The upward motions of three pull-up techniques were analysed: palms facing anterior, palms facing posterior and wide-grip. A skin-fixed scapula tracking technique with attached retro-reflective markers was used. Results: High intra-participant repeatability was observed: mean coefficients of multiple correlations of 0.87-1.00 in humerothoracic rotations and 0.77-0.90 for scapulothoracic rotations. Standard deviations of hand force was low: <5% body weight. Significantly different patterns of humerothoracic, scapulothoracic and glenohumeral kinematics were observed between the pull-up techniques. The reverse technique has extreme glenohumeral internal-external rotation and large deviation from the scapula plane. The wide technique has a reduced range of pro/retraction in the same HT plane of elevation and 90° of arm abduction with 45° external rotation was observed. All these factors suggest increased sub-acromial impingement risk. Conclusions: The scapula tracking technique showed high repeatability. High arm elevation during pull-ups reduces sub-acromial space and increases pressure, increasing the risk of impingement injury. Wide and reverse pull-ups demonstrate kinematics patterns linked with increased impingement risk. Weight-assisted front pull-ups require further investigation and could be recommended for weaker participants.

N2  - In previous shoulder impact studies, the 50th-percentile male GHBMC human body finite-element model was shown to have good biofidelity regarding impact force, but under-predicted shoulder deflection by 80% compared to those observed in the experiment. The goal of this study was to validate the response of the GHBMC M50 model by focusing on three-dimensional shoulder kinematics under a whole-body lateral impact condition. Five modifications, focused on material properties and modeling techniques, were introduced into the model and a supplementary sensitivity analysis was done to determine the influence of each modification to the biomechanical response of the body. The modified model predicted substantially improved shoulder response and peak shoulder deflection within 10% of the observed experimental data, and showed good correlation in the scapula kinematics on sagittal and transverse planes. The improvement in the biofidelity of the shoulder region was mainly due to the modifications of material properties of muscle, the acromioclavicular joint, and the attachment region between the pectoralis major and ribs. Predictions of rib fracture and chest deflection were also improved because of these modifications.

N2  - Background: The Lateral Scapular Slide Test is a static test used in clinical settings to assess medio-lateral inferior angle displacement and scapular asymmetry at three different degrees of shoulder abduction. However, there is no evidence in the literature about the reliability and diagnostic accuracy of a modified LSST (arm elevation in the scapular plane with loading) in a symptomatic population. Objective: To assess the intra- and inter-rater reliability, agreement, and diagnostic accuracy of the MLSST (Modified Lateral Scapular Slide Test) in subjects with and without shoulder symptoms. A new test position is examined, in which the arm is held in 90° of elevation in the scapular plane with 1 kg load. Design: Within day intra- and inter-rater reliability, agreement, and diagnostic accuracy study. Method: Participants included 25 (42 ± 2.7 years) subjects with shoulder symptoms and 25 (40 ± 2.1 years) asymptomatic control subjects. Two raters, blinded to each other's outcomes, measured the distance between the inferior scapular angle and T7 at arms by the side, hands on hips and 90° of arm elevation in the scapular plane with 1 kg load. Measurements were performed twice, bilaterally. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), minimal detectable change (MDC95%) and diagnostic accuracy were calculated. Results: The ICCs for intra- and inter-rater reliability were good to high in both shoulders of symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. The MDC95% in the symptomatic group ranged between 0.67 and 1.40 cm in the symptomatic shoulder and 0.72-1.16 cm in the asymptomatic shoulder. The asymptomatic group presented a MDC95% ranging between 0.63 and 1.52 cm in the dominant and 0.60-1.41 cm in the non dominant shoulder. Positive and negative likelihood ratios ranged between 0.67-5.50 and 0.81-1.11, respectively. Conclusion: The MLSST had good reliability and agreement properties to assess scapular position in both groups. However, no test position had clinical utility as a diagnostic criterion for shoulder pathology.

N2  - In this paper, the principal aspects of kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) analysis of the shoulder and their potential for the every-day clinical practice are described. The text reports a brief description of standard recommendations for movement assessment, an overview of the main quantitative motion analysis protocols and a description of the most commonly investigated scapulothoracic muscles. To assess the possibility of using these protocols for clinical applications, reliability and repeatability of kinematic and EMG measures were investigated and reference data for scapulohumeral joint kinematics were provided. The last part of the manuscript reports the integration of the quantitative analysis of scapula dyskinesis within the widely accepted Constant-Murley clinical score. In addition, examples of assessment of muscles activity and recruitment patterns are discussed since they are crucial for the clinical evaluation of common shoulder pathologies.

N2  - PURPOSE: The optimal treatment for acute dislocation of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint remains unclear, and prior randomized trials did not reveal any significant improvements in the operative groups. However, it is clear that some patients treated nonoperatively are dissatisfied with their outcome and request surgical correction. This video demonstrates one method of repair of a chronic dislocation of the AC joint in a patient with significant symptomatology following nonoperative treatment of a high-grade AC dislocation.
METHODS: This video demonstrates the open reduction of a chronically dislocated AC joint. After mobilization of the distal clavicle and debridement of the joint, a step cut is made in the anterior surface of the distal clavicle. The coracoacromial (CA) ligament is then identified and mobilized, taking care to preserve its acromial origin. An anterior acromioplasty is then performed with a microsaggital saw. The AC joint is reduced, and the acromial fragment is sculpted to fit the step cut in the distal clavicle, where it is then fixed with a small-fragment cancellous screw in lag fashion. The blade of the hook plate is then contoured to fit under the acromion (posteriorly) to hold the joint in a reduced position. The deltoid is repaired with number 1 absorbable sutures, followed by a standard closure.
RESULTS: Results are improved and complications minimized when care is taken to not avoid overreduction of the clavicle: an intraoperative radiograph, and/or comparison to the opposite side, may be useful. We do not shorten or resect the entire distal clavicle: this has been shown to lead to worse outcomes. We have found that CA transfer with a fragment of attached acromial bone results in more reliable healing than a CA transfer alone (the Weaver-Dunn transfer).
DISCUSSION: In the setting of a chronic AC dislocation, hook plate fixation provides excellent reduction of the joint and a stable mechanical environment: this allows for the optimal healing of the ligament transfer. Typically, 6-12 months postoperatively, the hook plate can be removed to improve motion and reduce local irritation because joint stability is then provided by the transfer with bone-to-bone healing.

N2  - Background Real-time ultrasound (RTUS) has been suggested as a reliable measure of acromiohumeral distance. However, to date, no vigorous assessment and reporting of inter-rater reliability of this method has been performed with the shoulder in a neutral position or with active and passive arm abduction. Objective To assess intrasession inter-rater reliability of using RTUS to measure acromiohumeral distance with the shoulder in a neutral position and with 60° active and passive abduction. Study Design Inter-rater intrasession reliability of repeated measures. Setting Human performance laboratory. Participants Twenty persons (12 male and 8 female) with an average age of 29.86 years (standard deviation, 7.8). Method In an inter-rater, intrasession study, RTUS was used to measure the acromiohumeral distance with the shoulder in a neutral position and with 60° of both active and passive abduction. Main Outcome Measure Acromiohumeral distance. Results Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)2.1 scores ranged between 0.65-0.88 (standard error of the mean = 0.81-1.2 mm and minimal detectable differences with 95% confidence = 2.2-2.3 mm) for inter-rater intrasession reliability. Conclusion RTUS was found to have fair to good inter-rater reliability as a tool to measure acromiohumeral distance with the shoulder in a neutral position and with 60° of both active and passive arm abduction.

N2  - Shoulder motions consist of a composite movement of three joints and one pseudo-joint, which together dictate the humerothoracic motion. The purpose of this work was to quantify the location of the centre of rotation (CoR) of the shoulder complex as a whole. Dynamic motion of 12 participants was recorded using optical motion tracking during coronal, scapular and sagittal plane elevation. The instantaneous CoR was found for each angle of elevation using helical axes projected onto the three planes of motion. The location of an average CoR for each plane was evaluated using digitised and anthropometric measures for normalisation. When conducting motion in the coronal, scapular, and sagittal planes, respectively, the coefficients for locating the CoRs of the shoulder complex are -61%, -61%, and -65% of the anterior-posterior dimension - the vector between the midpoint of the incisura jugularis and the xiphoid process and the midpoint of the seventh cervical vertebra and the eighth thoracic vertebra; 0%, -1%, and -2% of the superior-inferior dimension - the vector between the midpoint of the acromioclavicular joints and the midpoint of the anterior superior iliac spines; and 57%, 57%, and 78% of the medial-lateral dimension -0.129 times the height of the participant. Knowing the location of the CoR of the shoulder complex as a whole enables improved participant positioning for evaluation and rehabilitation activities that involve movement of the hand with a fixed radius, such as those that employ isokinetic dynamometers.

N2  - The Leap Motion Controller (LMC) is a low-cost, markerless motion capture device that tracks hand, wrist and forearm position. Integration of this technology into healthcare applications has begun to occur rapidly, making validation of the LMC's data output an important research goal. Here, we perform a detailed evaluation of the kinematic data output from the LMC, and validate this output against gold-standard, markered motion capture technology. We instructed subjects to perform three clinically-relevant wrist (flexion/extension, radial/ulnar deviation) and forearm (pronation/supination) movements. The movements were simultaneously tracked using both the LMC and a marker-based motion capture system from Motion Analysis Corporation (MAC). Adjusting for known inconsistencies in the LMC sampling frequency, we compared simultaneously acquired LMC and MAC data by performing Pearson's correlation (r) and root mean square error (RMSE). Wrist flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation showed good overall agreement (r = 0.95; RMSE = 11.6°, and r = 0.92; RMSE = 12.4°, respectively) with the MAC system. However, when tracking forearm pronation/supination, there were serious inconsistencies in reported joint angles (r = 0.79; RMSE = 38.4°). Hand posture significantly influenced the quality of wrist deviation (P < 0.005) and forearm supination/pronation (P < 0.001), but not wrist flexion/extension (P = 0.29). We conclude that the LMC is capable of providing data that are clinically meaningful for wrist flexion/extension, and perhaps wrist deviation. It cannot yet return clinically meaningful data for measuring forearm pronation/supination. Future studies should continue to validate the LMC as updated versions of their software are developed.

N2  - Background: Clinical scapulohumeral tests are lacking post-stroke. Objective: To test reliability and discriminant validity of clinical scapulohumeral assessments post-stroke. Methods: Following tests were assessed in 57 individuals with stroke (IwS) (subdivided in a low, moderate, high proximal arm function (PAF) group) and 15 healthy controls: (1) Observation of tilting/winging; (2) shoulder girdle position tests (pectoralis minor index, acromial index, scapular distance test); (3) scapular lateral rotation measurement; (4) maximal humeral elevation and (5) medial rotation test were executed. 15 IwS were measured twice by the same assessor to determine test-retest reliability. Differences between controls and IwS and between IwS with different levels of PAF were assessed. Results: ICCs were very high for all tests (>0.80), except the pectoralis minor index (0.66). Weighted Kappas were high for observation and the medial rotation test (>0.70). Group differences were found for observation, lateral rotation and humeral elevation. IwS compared to controls, and IwS with lower compared to higher PAF generally showed increased lateral rotation (p < .01); decreased maximal active humeral elevation (p < .001); and more often tilting and winging (p < .05). Conclusions: The use of these tests in clinical settings will allow for identification of altered scapular characteristics, which will enhance treatment planning for PAF post-stroke.

N2  - Motion analysis systems deliver quantitative information, e.g. on the progress of rehabilitation programs aimed at improving range of motion. Markerless systems are of interest for clinical application because they are low-cost and easy to use. The first generation of the Kinect™ sensor showed promising results in validity assessment compared to an established marker-based system. However, no literature is available on the validity of the new 'Kinect™ for Xbox one' (KinectOne) in tracking upper body motion. Consequently, this study was conducted to analyze the accuracy and reliability of the KinectOne in tracking upper body motion.Twenty subjects performed shoulder abduction in frontal and scapula plane, flexion, external rotation and horizontal flexion in two conditions (sitting and standing). Arm and trunk motion were analyzed using the KinectOne and compared to a marker-based system. Comparisons were made using Bland Altman statistics and Coefficient of Multiple Correlation.On average, differences between systems of 3.9 ± 4.0° and 0.1 ± 3.8° were found for arm and trunk motion, respectively. Correlation was higher for the arm than for the trunk motion.Based on the observed bias, the accuracy of the KinectOne was found to be adequate to measure arm motion in a clinical setting. Although trunk motion showed a very low absolute bias between the two systems, the KinectOne was not able to track small changes over time. Before the KinectOne can find clinical application, further research is required analyzing whether validity can be improved using a customized tracking algorithm or other sensor placement, and to analyze test-retest reliability.

N2  - Objective: Transfer of the spinal accessory nerve to the suprascapular nerve is a common procedure, performed to reestablish shoulder motion in patients with total brachial plexus palsy. However, the results of this procedure remain largely unknown. Methods: Over an 11-year period (2002-2012), 257 patients with total brachial plexus palsy were operated upon in the authors' department by a single surgeon and had the spinal accessory nerve transferred to the suprascapular nerve. Among these, 110 had adequate follow-up and were included in this study. Their average age was 26 years (SD 8.4 years), and the mean interval between their injury and surgery was 5.2 months (SD 2.4 months). Prior to 2005, the suprascapular and spinal accessory nerves were dissected through a classic supraclavicular L-shape incision (n = 29). Afterward (n = 81), the spinal accessory and suprascapular nerves were dissected via an oblique incision, extending from the point at which the plexus crossed the clavicle to the anterior border of the trapezius muscle. In 17 of these patients, because of clavicle fractures or dislocation, scapular fractures or retroclavicular scarring, the incision was extended by detaching the trapezius from the clavicle to expose the suprascapular nerve at the suprascapular fossa. In all patients, the brachial plexus was explored and elbow flexion reconstructed by root grafting (n = 95), root grafting and phrenic nerve transfer (n = 6), phrenic nerve transfer (n = 1), or third, fourth, and fifth intercostal nerve transfer. Postoperatively, patients were followed for an average of 40 months (SD 13.7 months). Results: Failed recovery, meaning less than 30° abduction, was observed in 10 (9%) of the 110 patients. The failure rate was 25% between 2002 and 2004, but dropped to 5% after the staged/extended approach was introduced. The mean overall range of abduction recovery was 58.5° (SD 26°). Comparing before and after distal suprascapular nerve exploration (2005-2012), the range of abduction recovery was 45° (SD 25.1°) versus 62° (SD 25.3°), respectively (p = 0.002). In patients who recovered at least 30° of abduction, recovery of elbow flexion to at least an M3 level of strength increased the range of abduction by an average of 13° (p = 0.01). Before the extended approach, 2 (7%) of 29 patients recovered active external rotation of 20° and 120°. With the staged/extended approach, 32 (40%) of 81 recovered some degree of active external rotation. In these patients, the average range of motion measured from the thorax was 87° (SD 40.6°). Conclusions: In total palsies of the brachial plexus, using the spinal accessory nerve for transfer to the suprascapular nerve is reliable and provides some recovery of abduction for a large majority of patients. In a few patients, a more extensive approach to access the suprascapular nerve, including, if necessary, dissection in the suprascapular fossa, may enhance outcomes.

N2  - Accurate measurement of joint kinematics is required to understand the musculoskeletal effects of a therapeutic intervention such as upper extremity (UE) ergometry. Traditional surface-based motion capture is effective for quantifying humerothoracic motion, but scapular kinematics are challenging to obtain. Methods for estimating scapular kinematics include the widely-reported acromion marker cluster (AMC) which utilizes a static calibration between the scapula and the AMC to estimate the orientation of the scapula during motion. Previous literature demonstrates that including additional calibration positions throughout the motion improves AMC accuracy for single plane motions; however this approach has not been assessed for the non-planar shoulder complex motion occurring during UE ergometry. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of single, dual, and multiple AMC calibration methods during UE ergometry. The orientations of the UE segments of 13 healthy subjects were recorded with motion capture. Scapular landmarks were palpated at eight evenly-spaced static positions around the 360° cycle. The single AMC method utilized one static calibration position to estimate scapular kinematics for the entire cycle, while the dual and multiple AMC methods used two and four static calibration positions, respectively. Scapulothoracic angles estimated by the three AMC methods were compared with scapulothoracic angles determined by palpation. The multiple AMC method produced the smallest RMS errors and was not significantly different from palpation about any axis. We recommend the multiple AMC method as a practical and accurate way to estimate scapular kinematics during UE ergometry.

N2  - Biomechanical measures are used to characterize the mechanisms of treatment for shoulder pain. The objective was to characterize test-retest reliability and measurement error of shoulder surface electromyographic(sEMG) and kinematic measures. Individuals(n = 12) with subacromial pain syndrome were tested at 2 visits. Five repetitions of shoulder scapular plane elevation were performed while collecting sEMG of the upper trapezius(UT), middle trapezius(MT), lower trapezius(LT), serratus anterior(SA) middle-deltoid, and infraspinatus muscles during ascending and descending phases. Simultaneously, electromagnetic sensors measured 3-dimensional kinematics of scapular internal/external rotation, upward/downward rotation, posterior/anterior tilt, and clavicular elevation/depression and clavicular protraction/retraction. Kinematic and sEMG variables were reduced for the total phase of ascending and descending elevation (30°-120°, 120°-30°), at 30° intervals for sEMG, and at every 30° discrete kinematic angle. The intraclass correlation coefficients(ICC) ranged from 0.08 to 0.99 for sEMG and 0.23-0.95 for kinematics. Correspondingly, the standard error of the measurement(SEM) and minimal detectable change(MDC) for sEMG measures varied from 2.3% to 103.8% of a reference contraction(REF-contraction). For kinematics, the SEM and MDC varied from 1.4° to 5.9°. Between-day reliability was good to very good, except for scapular internal/external rotation kinematics, and sEMG for the LT, UT, and SA. sEMG error values were highest (>25%REF-contraction) for most of the LT, UT, and SA variables. Kinematic error values indicate changes or differences of 2°-3° are meaningful, except for upward/downward rotation and internal/external rotation with MDCs of 4°-6°. Generally, data from the total phase of movement had better reliability and lower error than the data from sEMG interval or kinematic discrete angles.

N2  - METHOD: A convenience sample of 100 individuals (50 asymptomatic and 50 symptomatic) participated in this study. Intra- and interrater reliability of the measurement was estimated in 50 individuals (25 asymptomatic and 25 symptomatic), and between-day reliability of the measurement repeated over an interval of 7 days was estimated in an independent sample of 50 additional participants. Pectoralis minor length was measured using a flexible tape measure with subjects standing.
RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC3,k) for intrarater and interrater reliability ranged from 0.86-0.97 and 0.95 for between-day reliability in both groups. Standard error of measurements (SEM) ranged from 0.30-0.42 cm, 0.70-0.84 cm, and 0.40-0.41 cm for intrarater, interrater, and between-day reliability, respectively, across the sample. The minimal detectable change (MDC) for between-day measurements ranged from 1.13-1.14 cm for both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In asymptomatic individuals and in those with signs of shoulder impingement, a single rater or pair of raters can measure pectoralis minor muscle length using a tape measure with very good reliability. This measurement can also be reliably used by the same rater over a seven day interval.
BACKGROUND: Pectoralis minor adaptive shortening may change scapula resting position and scapular kinematics during arm elevation. A reliable and clinically feasible method for measuring pectoralis minor length will be useful for clinical decision making when evaluating and treating individuals with shoulder pain and dysfunction.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate intrarater, interrater, and between-day reliability of a pectoralis minor (PM) muscle length measurement in subjects with and without signs of shoulder impingement.

N2  - To describe shoulder motion the sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joint centres must be accurately located. Within the literature various methods to estimate joint centres of rotation location are proposed, with no agreement of the method best suited to the shoulder. The objective of this study was to determine the most reliable non-invasive method for locating joint centre locations of the shoulder complex. Functional methods using pin mounted markers were compared to anatomical methods, functional methods using skin mounted markers, imaging-based methods using CT-scan data, and regression equations. Three participants took part in the study, that involved insertion of intracortical pins into the clavicle, scapula and humerus, a CT-scan of the shoulder, and finally data collection using a motion analysis system. The various methods to estimate joint centre location did not all agree, however suggestions about the most reliable non-invasive methods could be made. For the sternoclavicular joint, the authors suggest the anatomical method using the most ventral landmark on the sternoclavicular joint, as recommended by the International Society of Biomechanics. For the acromioclavicular joint, the authors suggest the anatomical method using the landmark defined as the most dorsal point on the acromioclavicular joint, as proposed by van der Helm. For the glenohumeral joint, the simple regression equation of Rab is recommended.

N2  - Background: Because of detachment of the pectoralis minor and variation of the vector of the conjoint tendons, we hypothesized that the Latarjet procedure may alter scapular position and motion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate scapular position and motion in patients who underwent a Latarjet or a modified iliac crest bone graft transfer (ICBGT) procedure (J-bone graft). Methods: Forty-six consecutive patients treated for recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation between 2010 and 2012 were retrospectively enrolled. Twenty-three were treated with a Latarjet and 23 with an ICBGT procedure. Twenty Latarjet and 20 ICBGT patients were available at a mean follow-up of 20 months (min, 12; max, 60). We recorded the Western Ontario Instability Index, the Rowe Score, and the Subjective Shoulder Value. Scapulothoracic position was studied according to the dyskinesis yes/no method. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability of the dyskinesis assessment was assessed. Results: Intraobserver and interobserver reliability of scapula dyskinesis assessment was high (Latarjet: intratester, κ = 0.84; intertester, κ = 0.75; ICBGT: intratester, κ = 0.78; intertester, κ = 0.71). Scapular dyskinesis was observed after 5 of 20 Latarjet and after 0 of 20 ICBGT procedures (P = .047). Patients with dyskinesis had lower scores (Western Ontario Instability Index, P = .043; Rowe, P = .047; Subjective Shoulder Value, P = .046), but no statistically significant difference was found between the Latarjet and ICBGT groups. Two of the 5 scapular dyskinesis patients reached the SICK (Scapular malposition, Inferior medial scapular winging, Coracoid tenderness, and scapular dysKinesis) scapula syndrome definition. Conclusions: Scapular dyskinesis was found in 5 of 20 patients who underwent a Latarjet procedure. Dyskinesis may be related to the detachment of the pectoralis minor, and variation of the vector and the working length of the coracobrachialis and the short head of the biceps.

N2  - Objective: Examine the interrater reliability of cervicothoracic and shoulder physical examination in patients with a primary complaint of shoulder pain. Design: Single-group repeated-measures design for interrater reliability. Setting: Orthopaedic physical therapy clinics. Participants: Twenty-one patients with a primary complaint of shoulder pain underwent a standardized examination by a physical therapist (PT). A PT conducted the first examination and one of two additional PTs conducted the 2nd examination. Main outcome measures: The Cohen κ and weighted κ were used to calculate the interrater reliability of ordinal level data. Intraclass correlation coefficients model 2,1 (ICC2,1) and the 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine the interrater reliability. Results: The kappa coefficients ranged from -.24 to .83 for the mobility assessment of the glenohumeral, acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joints. The kappa coefficients ranged from -.20 to .58 for joint mobility assessment of the cervical and thoracic spine. The kappa coefficients ranged from .23 to 1.0 for special tests of the shoulder and cervical spine. Conclusions: The present study reported the reliability of a comprehensive upper quarter physical examination for a group of patients with a primary report of shoulder pain. The reliability varied considerably for the cervical and shoulder examination and was significantly higher for the examination of muscle length and cervical range of motion.

N2  - The reliability of joint rotation measurements is an issue of major interest, especially in clinical applications. The effect of instrumental errors and soft tissue artifacts on the variability of human motion measures is well known, but the influence of the representation of joint motion has not yet been studied. The aim of the study was to compare the within-subject reliability of three rotation formalisms for the calculation of the shoulder elevation joint angles. Five repetitions of humeral elevation in the scapular plane of 27 healthy subjects were recorded using a stereophotogrammetry system. The humerothoracic joint angles were calculated using the YX'Y″ and XZ'Y″ Euler angle sequences and the attitude vector. A within-subject repeatability study was performed for the three representations. ICC, SEM and CV were the indices used to estimate the error in the calculation of the angle amplitudes and the angular waveforms with each method. Excellent results were obtained in all representations for the main angle (elevation), but there were remarkable differences for axial rotation and plane of elevation. The YX'Y″ sequence generally had the poorest reliability in the secondary angles. The XZ'Y' sequence proved to be the most reliable representation of axial rotation, whereas the attitude vector had the highest reliability in the plane of elevation. These results highlight the importance of selecting the method used to describe the joint motion when within-subjects reliability is an important issue of the experiment. This may be of particular importance when the secondary angles of motions are being studied.

N2  - Background: Inferior joint mobilization has been proposed as an assessment technique and an intervention for individuals with shoulder dysfunctions. While such techniques are common, few quantitative in vivo measures of manual movement of the humeral head have been reported. Objective: The purpose of this study was to measure in vivo inferior translational movements occurring in the glenohumeral joint during manual mobilization techniques and to determine the intratester reliability of those inferior translational movements. Design: Cross sectional reliability study. Methods: Twenty three healthy volunteers participated. Subjects were positioned supine with the shoulder in 55 degrees of abduction and 30 degrees of horizontal adduction. Visualizing the humeral head and the acromion, ultrasound images of the superior aspect of the glenohumeral joint were taken with the arm at rest and as an examiner applied a grade 1, a grade 2 and a grade 3 inferior mobilization. This process was repeated three times on each shoulder. Humeral head position was measured in reference to the superior aspect of the acromion and the amount of inferior movement determined by the distance the humeral head moved from the rest position. Results: The mean differences between the rest position and a grade 1, a grade 2 and a grade 3 mobilization were 0.96 mm, 2.44 mm and 3.64 mm respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for movements were moderate for grade one (ICC = 0.681) and good for grade 2 (0.889) and grade 3(0.898). Conclusions: Results support the ability of one examiner to reliably reproduce three different grades of inferior mobilization.

N2  - Background: Anterior shoulder dislocation causes injury to the inferior gleno-humeral ligament (IGHL) and capsule. Clinical manoeuvres currently used to evaluate the IGHL test for, and may induce, apprehension. We developed the hyper extension-internal rotation (HERI) test to assess the IGHL and inferior capsule without causing apprehension or inducing a risk of gleno-humeral dislocation. Hypothesis: The HERI test is easy to perform and reproducible, induces no risk of gleno-humeral dislocation during the manoeuvre, and causes no apprehension in the patients. Material and methods: We studied 14 fresh cadaver shoulders. Each specimen was positioned supine with the lateral edge of the scapula on the table and the upper limb hanging down beside the table under the effect of gravity. This position produced hyperextension and internal rotation of the gleno-humeral joint. For each shoulder, the range of extension (°) was measured before and after isolated IGHL section. Then, we performed the HEIR test in 50 patients with chronic unilateral anterior gleno-humeral instability and we compared the range of extension between the normal and abnormal sides. Results: In the cadaver study, isolated IGHL section increased the angle of extension by a mean of 14.5° (11°-18°) compared to the pre-injury values. In the clinical study, the mean difference in extension angles between the normal and abnormal sides was 14.5°. The patients reported no apprehension during the HERI test. Conclusion: The angle of extension increases after section or injury of the IGHL in cadaver specimens and patients, respectively. When the inferior capsule and IGHL are damaged, the angle of extension increases compared to the normal side. Lesions to these structures can be evaluated clinically by performing the HERI test. Level of evidence: III.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to analyse and compare the clinical and radiological results after open posterior bone block procedure at long- (LT) and short-term (ST) follow-up. The hypothesis was that placement of a bone block at the posterior glenoid rim in a technique of extending the glenoid surface will create permanent joint stability even in cases with hyperlaxity without a clinically relevant loss of motion or increase in osteoarthritis.
METHODS: Fifteen consecutive shoulders with recurrent posterior dislocation were evaluated clinically and radiologically. The Rowe score, Western Ontario Shoulder Index, Walch-Duplay score and the Constant-Murley score were used for clinical evaluation. The patients were categorized according to their follow-up period as either ST follow-up (min 12 months) or LT follow-up (min 42 months).
RESULTS: The clinical results showed no significant difference between ST (9) and LT (6) with good to very good overall results in the subjective as well as the objective scores (CS, RS, WDS). At LT, most patients felt mild to minor pain under strain. The difference in pain between the groups was not significant. Active ranges of motion and strength assessments were normal in all cases. In one case, recurrent dislocations occurred after bone graft resorption 6 months post-operatively. Only one patient presented mild osteoarthritis, without further progress at follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The open posterior bone block procedure can be a successful treatment option for recurrent posterior shoulder instability at ST and LT follow-up. This series showed a low rate of recurrent dislocations without development or progression of osteoarthritis. Since soft tissue procedures do not always provide satisfying results, the posterior bone block augmentation presents a reliable technique for the treatment of symptomatic posterior instability.

N2  - The complexity of shoulder mechanics combined with the movement of skin relative to the scapula makes it difficult to measure shoulder kinematics with sufficient accuracy to distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Multibody skeletal models can improvemotion capture accuracy by reducing the space of possible joint movements, and models are used widely to improve measurement of lower limb kinematics. In this study, we developed a rigid-body model of a scapulothoracic joint to describe the kinematics of the scapula relative to the thorax. This model describes scapular kinematics with four degrees of freedom: 1) elevation and 2) abduction of the scapula on an ellipsoidal thoracic surface, 3) upward rotation of the scapula normal to the thoracic surface, and 4) internal rotation of the scapula to lift the medial border of the scapula off the surface of the thorax. The surface dimensions and joint axes can be customized to match an individual's anthropometry. We compared the model to "gold standard" bone-pin kinematics collected during three shoulder tasks and found modeled scapular kinematics to be accurate to within 2mm root-mean-squared error for individual bone-pin markers across all markers and movement tasks. As an additional test, we added random and systematic noise to the bone-pin marker data and found that the model reduced kinematic variability due to noise by 65% compared to Euler angles computed without themodel. Our scapulothoracic joint model can be used for inverse and forward dynamics analyses and to compute joint reaction loads. The computational performance of the scapulothoracic joint model is well suited for real-time applications; it is freely available for use with OpenSim3.2, and is customizable and usable with other OpenSim models.

N2  - Background: Computed tomography (CT) scans of the shoulder are often not well aligned to the axis of the scapula and glenoid. The purpose of this paper was to determine the effect of sagittal rotation of the glenoid on axial measurements of anterior-posterior (AP) glenoid width and glenoid version attained by standard CT scan. In addition, we sought to define the angle of rotation required to correct the CT scan to optimal positioning. Methods: A total of 30 CT scans of the shoulder were reformatted using OsiriX software multiplanar reconstruction. The uncorrected (UNCORR) and corrected (CORR) CT scans were compared for measurements of both (1) axial AP glenoid width and (2) glenoid version at 5 standardized axial cuts. Results: The mean difference in glenoid version was 2.6% (2° ± 0.1°; P =.0222) and the mean difference in AP glenoid width was 5.2% (1.2 ± 0.42 mm; P =.0026) in comparing the CORR and UNCORR scans. The mean angle of correction required to align the sagittal plane was 20.1° of rotation (range, 9°-39°; standard error of mean, 1.2°). Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that UNCORR CT scans of the glenohumeral joint do not correct for the sagittal rotation of the glenoid, and this affects the characteristics of the axial images. Failure to align the sagittal image to the 12-o'clock to 6-o'clock axis results in measurement error in both glenoid version and AP glenoid width. Use of UNCORR CT images may have notable implications for decision-making and surgical treatment.

N2  - Background: Acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation is a common shoulder injury that affects young adults. The treatment of these injuries depends on dislocation grade, the patient's complaints and time since injury. Materials: Patients with acute AC joint injuries (Rockwood grades III-V) of less than 4 weeks duration were included in the study. We had 10 cases of AC joint injuries, which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All patients were diagnosed based on history, examination and plain radiographs. Grading was done based on plain radiographs. Patients with grades III-V were selected for TightRope fixation. All 10 patients with AC joint injury underwent arthroscopic AC joint fixation using TightRope. Functional outcome of patients was done using constant shoulder score preoperatively and postoperatively. All patients were followed up for at least one year. We were able to achieve satisfactory reduction in all the patients. Results: Mean constant score at the final follow-up was 92.2 (range 76-97). The mean difference in constant score between operated and normal shoulder was 9.8. On the basis of difference of constant score, 7 patients had excellent results, 2 had good results and 1 had fair result. Conclusion: Arthroscopic fixation of acute AC joint dislocation using the TightRope device is a simple, reproducible, minimal invasive technique that enables a rapid return to activity for the acute injury.

N2  - Background: Patient-specific performance assessment of arm movements in daily life activities is fundamental for neurological rehabilitation therapy. In most applications, the shoulder movement is simplified through a socket-ball joint, neglecting the movement of the scapular-thoracic complex. This may lead to significant errors. We propose an innovative bi-articular model of the human shoulder for estimating the position of the hand in relation to the sternum. The model takes into account both the scapular-toracic and gleno-humeral movements and their ratio governed by the scapular-humeral rhythm, fusing the information of inertial and textile-based strain sensors. Method: To feed the reconstruction algorithm based on the bi-articular model, an ad-hoc sensing shirt was developed. The shirt was equipped with two inertial measurement units (IMUs) and an integrated textile strain sensor. We built the bi-articular model starting from the data obtained in two planar movements (arm abduction and flexion in the sagittal plane) and analysing the error between the reference data-measured through an optical reference system-and the socket-ball approximation of the shoulder. The 3D model was developed by extending the behaviour of the kinematic chain revealed in the planar trajectories through a parameter identification that takes into account the body structure of the subject. Result: The bi-articular model was evaluated in five subjects in comparison with the optical reference system. The errors were computed in terms of distance between the reference position of the trochlea (end-effector) and the correspondent model estimation. The introduced method remarkably improved the estimation of the position of the trochlea (and consequently the estimation of the hand position during reaching activities) reducing position errors from 11.5 cm to 1.8 cm. Conclusion: Thanks to the developed bi-articular model, we demonstrated a reliable estimation of the upper arm kinematics with a minimal sensing system suitable for daily life monitoring of recovery.

N2  - Purpose: The optimal treatment for acute dislocation of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint remains unclear, and prior randomized trials did not reveal any significant improvements in the operative groups. However, it is clear that some patients treated nonoperatively are dissatisfied with their outcome and request surgical correction. This video demonstrates one method of repair of a chronic dislocation of the AC joint in a patient with significant symptomatology following nonoperative treatment of a high-grade AC dislocation. Methods: This video demonstrates the open reduction of a chronically dislocated AC joint. After mobilization of the distal clavicle and debridement of the joint, a step cut is made in the anterior surface of the distal clavicle. The coracoacromial (CA) ligament is then identified and mobilized, taking care to preserve its acromial origin. An anterior acromioplasty is then performed with a microsaggital saw. The AC joint is reduced, and the acromial fragment is sculpted to fit the step cut in the distal clavicle, where it is then fixed with a small-fragment cancellous screw in lag fashion. The blade of the hook plate is then contoured to fit under the acromion (posteriorly) to hold the joint in a reduced position. The deltoid is repaired with number 1 absorbable sutures, followed by a standard closure. Results: Results are improved and complications minimized when care is taken to not avoid overreduction of the clavicle: an intraoperative radiograph, and/or comparison to the opposite side, may be useful. We do not shorten or resect the entire distal clavicle: this has been shown to lead to worse outcomes. We have found that CA transfer with a fragment of attached acromial bone results in more reliable healing than a CA transfer alone (the Weaver-Dunn transfer). Discussion: In the setting of a chronic AC dislocation, hook plate fixation provides excellent reduction of the joint and a stable mechanical environment: this allows for the optimal healing of the ligament transfer. Typically, 6-12 months postoperatively, the hook plate can be removed to improve motion and reduce local irritation because joint stability is then provided by the transfer with bone-tobone healing.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of external rotation and active supination CT arthrography in postoperative evaluation by comparing it with neutral CT arthrography and analyzing its agreement with postoperative clinical results after the repair of type II superior labral anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 patients who had undergone CT arthrography in neutral, external rotation and active supination position at least 1 year after the arthroscopic repair of SLAP lesions were enrolled. Two radiologists independently evaluated the status of the repaired SLAP lesions with neutral CT arthrography and then with external rotation and active supination CT arthrography.
RESULTS: Five patients had residual symptoms and positive findings upon SLAP-specific examinations. Agreements between the presence of symptoms and radiologic diagnoses based on neutral CT arthrography were insignificant for reader 1 (κ = 0.138, p = n.s.) and significant for reader 2 (κ = 0.328, p = 0.027). However, agreements were highly significant in the analysis following the evaluation of external rotation and active supination CT arthrography for both readers (κ = 0.694, p < 0.001 in reader 1; κ = 0.783, p < 0.001 in reader 2).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of contrast-filled gaps between the labrum and glenoid on neutral CT arthrography after SLAP repair is frequent with satisfactory clinical outcomes. Gaps without additional widening upon external rotation and active supination CT arthrography may suggest postoperatively stable biceps anchors, so this new method could minimize the overdiagnosis of recurrent SLAP lesions. Additional gap widening on external rotation and active supination CT arthrography could be related to a true recurrent SLAP lesion and the symptoms of the patients.

N2  - The most common sequela of neonatal brachial plexus palsy is an internal rotation contracture of the shoulder that impairs function and leads to skeletal deformation of the glenohumeral joint. Treatment options include release, transfers, and humeral osteotomy, all ultimately striving for better function through increased external rotation. Prior studies have shown that neonatal brachial plexus palsy alters humeral retroversion but with conflicting findings. We studied retroversion in children with internal rotation contractures from neonatal brachial plexus palsy to clarify its effect on version and surgical planning. Methods: Bilateral shoulder and elbow magnetic resonance imaging scans of 21 children with neonatal brachial plexus palsy were retrospectively analyzed. Retroversion referenced to the transepicondylar line at the elbow was measured with respect to 2 different proximal reference axes, the longest diameter of an axial cut of the proximal part of the humerus (the skew axis) and the line perpendicular to the articular surface (the humeral center line). Glenoid version and glenohumeral morphology type (concentric glenoid, posterior-concentric glenoid, biconcave, or pseudoglenoid) were also determined. All geometric variables were assessed for correlation with patient age and the severity of the internal rotation contracture. Results: Retroversion on the involved side was decreased at 6° compared with 19° (p = 0.003), as measured between the skew axis and transepicondylar line. Retroversion referenced to the humeral center line was also decreased at 22° (anteversion) compared with 20° (p < 0.001). Patient age was inversely correlated with retroversion, but was only significant for the skew axis (r =20.497, p = 0.022), decreasing in linear regression by 2.4° per year (p = 0.038). Humeral retroversion did not correlate with the severity of the internal rotation contracture, glenoid version, or glenoid morphology type. Conclusions: Humeral retroversion is likely to be less on the affected side in children with internal rotation contractures from upper trunk neonatal brachial plexus palsy and merits consideration in surgical planning.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although intensively investigated, the procedures for assessment and monitoring of scoliosis are still a subject of controversies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess validity and reliability of a number of physiotherapeutic measurements that could be used for clinical monitoring of scoliosis. METHODS: Fifteen healthy (symmetric) subjects were subjected to a set of measurements two times, by two experienced and two inexperienced physiotherapists. Intra-observer and inter-observer reliability of measurements were determined. Following measurements were performed: body height and weight, chest girth in inspirium and expirium, the length of legs, the spine translation, the lateral pelvic tilt, the equality of the shoulders, position of scapulas, the equality of stature triangles, the rib hump, the existence of m. iliopsoas contracture, Fröhner index, the size of lumbar lordosis and the angle of trunk rotation. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficient was high (> 0.8) for majority of measurements when experienced physiotherapists performed them, while inexperienced physiotherapists performed precisely only basic, easy measurements. CONCLUSIONS:We showed in this pilot study on healthy subjects, that majority of basic physiotherapeutic measurements are valid and reliable when performed by specialized physiotherapist, and it can be expected that this protocol will gain high value when measurements on subjects with scoliosis are performed.

N2  - Objective: Evaluation of scapular posture is an integral component of the clinical assessment of painful neck disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate agreement between therapist judgements of scapula posture in multiple biomechanical planes in individuals with neck pain. Design: Inter-therapist reliability study. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: Fifteen participants with chronic neck pain. Main outcome measures: Four physiotherapists recorded ratings of scapular orientation (relative to the thorax) in five different scapula postural planes (plane of scapula, sagittal plane, transverse plane, horizontal plane, and vertical plane) under four test conditions (at rest, and during three isometric shoulder conditions) in all participants. Inter-therapist reliability was expressed using both generalized and paired kappa coefficient. Results: Following adjustment for expected agreement and the high prevalence of neutral ratings (81%), on average both the generalised kappa (0.37) as well as Cohen's Kappa for the two therapist pairs (0.45 and 0.42) demonstrated only slight to moderate inter-therapist reliability. Conclusions: The findings suggest that ratings of scapular posture in individuals with neck pain by visual inspection has only slight to moderate reliability and should only be used in conjunction with other clinical tests when judging scapula function in these patients.

N2  - Purpose To evaluate the presence and degree of glenohumeral dysplasia (GHD) in infants undergoing surgical exploration for neonatal brachial plexus palsy (NBPP) and to identify potential predictive factors of early maladaptive shoulder morphology. Methods We included all consecutive patients with NBPP who underwent surgical exploration of their brachial plexus and who had a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan at our institution over a 3-year period. Demographic, therapy, and surgical data were collected. Imaging was reviewed for glenoid morphology, glenoid version, percent humeral head anterior to the scapula, and alpha angle. Results Of 116 infants who presented to our institution during this 3-year period, 19 (16%) underwent surgical exploration and were included in the study. Median age at the time of the scan was 16 weeks (interquartile range, 14-46 weeks). Fourteen of 19 (74%) had GHD of Waters class 2 or increased malformation. Babies who had more severe palsies underwent earlier surgery and had less severe GHD at the time of surgery than did those with less severe palsies who had surgery later. Less severe GHD was associated with more severe palsies, as indicated by Narakas classification and number of root avulsions. Active external rotation was almost universally absent whereas other shoulder movements were present to varying degrees. More severe GHD was associated with greater total shoulder active range of motion and greater pectoralis major muscle mass. Conclusions Glenohumeral dysplasia occurs often and early in NBPP and may occur in the absence of restricted range of motion. Predictors include increasing age and factors related to muscular imbalance. As such, GHD likely affects the functional outcome that may be achieved with reinnervation, and early screening may improve outcomes. Type of study/level of evidence Prognostic IV.

N2  - Snapping scapula syndrome at the superomedial corner of the scapula can lead to significant shoulder dysfunction. Bursectomy with or without partial scapulectomy is currently the most beneficial primary method of treatment in patients in whom nonoperative therapy fails. Arthroscopic access to the scapulothoracic space is simple and reproducible with the technique described in this report. The bursal tissue can be cleared, optimizing visualization of the scapulothoracic space and the anatomic structures. Arthroscopic decompression of the scapulothoracic bursa and resection of the superomedial corner of the scapula are highlighted in a video example.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) is frequently used to diagnose glenoid bone defects in anterior shoulder instability. The assessment of glenoid defects on 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) CT scans has been reported with and without a comparative study of the contralateral shoulder; however, no previous studies have analyzed if these 4 methods agree.
PURPOSE: To estimate agreement between CT assessments of glenoid defects by examination of the affected shoulder alone and by comparison with the contralateral side on both 2D and 3D CT scans.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 200 prospectively enlisted patients affected by unilateral anterior shoulder instability underwent CT of both shoulders. The area of the missing glenoid was calculated on 4 sets of CT scans (2D and 3D CT images with and without comparison with the contralateral shoulder) by using the circle method. Agreement between the 4 measurements in quantifying the bone defect was estimated according to the Bland-Altman method. Agreement between the 4 measurements in assessing the presence and type of defect (fracture or erosion) was analyzed with κ statistics.
RESULTS: Analysis of agreement between CT measurements in quantifying glenoid bone defects showed that the mean difference between the 4 measures was less than 1% of the area of the inferior glenoid in each pairwise comparison. Limits of agreement were always below the established acceptable limit of 5%. The assessment of the presence and type of bone defect showed strong to near-complete agreement between the 4 measurement methods.
CONCLUSION: CT assessments of glenoid bone defects with and without comparison with the contralateral shoulder showed very good agreement in identifying the size, presence, and type of defect in patients with anterior shoulder instability on both 2D and 3D CT scans.

N2  - The shoulder complex in the human body consists of the scapula, clavicle, humerus, and thorax and bears the load imposed by arm movements while at the same time realizing a wide range of motions. To mimic and exploit its role, several musculoskeletal robot arms with shoulder complex mechanisms have been developed. However, although many research groups have tried to design the structures using links and joints that faithfully correspond to the bones and joints in the human shoulder complex, its function has not been successfully reproduced because biologically plausible designs seriously compromise engineering plausibility. In this paper, we propose a linkage mechanism that can reproduce complex three-dimensional scapulo movements and considers the trade-off between biological and engineering plausibilities. Subsequently, the design was validated by driving the mechanism using pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) placed similarly to muscles in humans. Further, we present experiments in which the robot was controlled by surface electromyographic signals from a human. We show that the proposed design, due to its kinematic similarity with human musculoskeletal systems, eases the conversion between the surface electromyogram signals and the PAMs control inputs.

N2  - Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of arthroscopy-assisted reconstruction of the coracoclavicular (CC) ligament using Endobutton for treating acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation. Methods From March 2012 to May 2013, a total of 22 patients with fresh AC joint dislocation (Rockwood type III and type V) were treated with arthroscopy-assisted Endobutton reconstruction of the CC ligament. The regular postoperation follow-up was performed. Shoulder joint function was assessed with Constant–Murley scores. Postoperative efficacy of the surgery was evaluated using the Karlsson criterion. Results The 22 patients were followed postoperatively for an average of 24 months (16–31 months). Among them, 20 patients achieved good functional recovery with no pain. Two patients had slight pain in the acromion during shoulder joint motion with limited abduction at 3 months, both of whom had recovered at 6 months. Radiography confirmed anatomical reduction of the AC joint in all patients. At 1 year, the Constant–Murley scores were 93.1±2.4 points on the injured side versus 94.2±2.7 points on the uninjured side. The difference did not reach statistical significance (P > 0.05). Postoperative Karlsson evaluation ranked 20 patients (90.9 %) as grade A and 2 as grade B (9.1 %) at the 3-month follow-up. All patients had become grade A at 6 months. None of the patients had brachial plexus or peripheral vascular injuries. Conclusion Arthroscopy-assisted reconstruction of the coracoclavicular ligament by Endobutton fixation is a safe, easy method for treating AC joint dislocation. It provides reliable fixation, causes little trauma, and has a fast recovery.

N2  - Background Driving is one of the most common everyday tasks and the rotator cuff muscles are the primary shoulder stabilisers. Muscle forces during driving are not currently known, yet knowledge of these would influence important clinical advice such as return to activities after surgery. The aim of this study is to quantify shoulder and rotator cuff muscle forces during driving in different postures. Methods A musculoskeletal modelling approach is taken, using a modified driving simulator in combination with an upper limb musculoskeletal model (UK National Shoulder Model). Motion data and external force vectors were model inputs and upper limb muscle and joint forces were the outputs. Findings Comparisons of the predicted glenohumeral joint forces were compared to in vivo literature values, with good agreement demonstrated (61 SD 8% body weight mean peak compared to 60 SD 1% body weight mean peak). High muscle activation was predicted in the rotator cuff muscles; particularly supraspinatus (mean 55% of the maximum and up to 164 SD 27 N). This level of loading is up to 72% of mean failure strength for supraspinatus repairs, and could therefore be dangerous for some cases. Statistically significant and large differences are shown to exist in the joint and muscle forces for different driving positions as well as steering with one or both hands (up to 46% body weight glenohumeral joint force). Interpretation These conclusions should be a key consideration in rehabilitating the shoulder after surgery, preventing specific upper limb injuries and predicting return to driving recommendations.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of the tension on the long head of the biceps tendon in the propagation of SLAP tears by studying the mechanical behavior of the torn superior glenoid labrum. A previously validated finite element model was extended to include a glenoid labrum with type II SLAP tears of three different sizes. The strain distribution within the torn labral tissue with loading applied to the biceps tendon was investigated and compared to the inact and unloaded conditions. The anterior and posterior edges of each SLAP tear experienced the highest strain in the labrum. Labral strain increased with increasing biceps tension. This effect was stronger in the labrum when the size of the tear exceeded the width of the biceps anchor on the superior labrum. Thus, this study indicates that biceps tension influences the propagation of a SLAP tear more than it does the initiation of a tear. Additionally, it also suggests that the tear size greater than the biceps anchor site as a criterion in determining optimal treatment of a type II SLAP tear.

N2  - Micromotion around implants is commonly measured using displacement-sensor techniques. Due to the limitations of these techniques, an alternative approach (DVC-μCT) using digital volume correlation (DVC) and micro-CT (μCT) was developed in this study. The validation consisted of evaluating DVC-μCT based micromotion against known micromotions (40, 100 and 150μm) in a simplified experiment. Subsequently, a more clinically realistic experiment in which a glenoid component was implanted into a porcine scapula was carried out and the DVC-μCT measurements during a single load cycle (duration 20min due to scanning time) was correlated with the manual tracking of micromotion at 12 discrete points across the implant interface. In this same experiment the full-field DVC-μCT micromotion was compared to the full-field micromotion predicted by a parallel finite element analysis (FEA). It was found that DVC-μCT micromotion matched the known micromotion of the simplified experiment (average/peak error=1.4/1.7μm, regression line slope=0.999) and correlated with the micromotion at the 12 points tracked manually during the realistic experiment (R2=0.96). The DVC-μCT full-field micromotion matched the pattern of the full-field FEA predicted micromotion. This study showed that the DVC-μCT technique provides sensible estimates of micromotion. The main advantages of this technique are that it does not damage important parts of the specimen to gain access to the bone-implant interface, and it provides a full-field evaluation of micromotion as opposed to the micromotion at just a few discrete points. In conclusion the DVC-μCT technique provides a useful tool for investigations of micromotion around plastic implants.

N2  - Background: Knowledge of the kinematics and associated muscular activity in individuals with scapular dyskinesis may provide insight into the injury mechanism and inform the planning of treatment strategies. We investigated scapular kinematics and associated muscular activation during arm movements in individuals with scapular dyskinesis. Methods: A visual-based palpation method was used to evaluate 82 participants with unilateral shoulder pain. Scapular movements during arm raising/lowering movements were classified as abnormal single pattern (inferior angle prominence, pattern I; medial border prominence, pattern II; excessive/inadequate scapular elevation or upward rotation, pattern III), abnormal mixed patterns, or normal pattern (pattern IV). Scapular kinematics and associated muscular activation were assessed with an electromagnetic motion-capturing system and surface electromyography. Results: More scapular internal rotation was found in pattern II subjects (4°, P=.009) and mixed pattern I and II subjects (4°, P=.023) than in control subjects during arm lowering. Scapular posterior tipping (3°, P=.028) was less in pattern I subjects during arm lowering. Higher upper trapezius activity (14%, P=.01) was found in pattern II subjects during arm lowering. In addition, lower trapezius (5%, P=.025) and serratus anterior activity (10%, P=.004) were less in mixed pattern I and II subjects during arm lowering. Conclusions: Specific alterations of scapular muscular activation and kinematics were found in different patterns of scapular dyskinesis. The findings also validated the use of a comprehensive classification test to assess scapular dyskinesis, especially in the lowering phase of arm elevation.

N2  - Background: Accurate assessment of the critical shoulder angle (CSA) is important in clinical evaluation of degenerative rotator cuff tears. This study analyzed the influence of radiographic viewing perspective on the CSA, developed a classification system to identify malpositioned radiographs, and assessed the relationship between the CSA and demographic factors. Methods: Glenoid height, width, and retroversion were measured on 3-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions of 68 cadaver scapulae. A digitally reconstructed radiograph was aligned perpendicular to the scapular plane, and retroversion was corrected to obtain a true anteroposterior (AP) view. In 10 scapulae, incremental anteversion/retroversion and flexion/extension views were generated. The CSA was measured, and a clinically applicable classification system was developed to detect views with >2° change in CSA vs. true AP view. Results: The average CSA was 33° ± 4°. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability was high (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥ 0.81) but decreased with increasing viewing angle. Views beyond 5° anteversion, 8° retroversion, 15° flexion, and 26° extension resulted in >2° deviation of the CSA compared with the true AP view. The classification system was capable of detecting aberrant viewing perspectives with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 53%. Correlations between glenoid size and CSA were small (. R≤0.3), and CSA did not vary by gender (. P=.426) or side (. P=.821). Conclusions: The CSA was most susceptible to malposition in anteversion/retroversion. Deviations as little as 5° in anteversion resulted in a CSA >2° from true AP view. A new classification system refines the ability to collect true AP radiographs of the scapula. The CSA was unaffected by demographic factors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Dominant shoulder glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) has been associated with pitching arm injuries. The relationship of humeral torsion on development of GIRD is not clear.
HYPOTHESIS: Pitchers displaying GIRD will display greater humeral retrotorsion when compared with those without GIRD.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: Humeral torsion and shoulder range of motion (ROM) were measured in 222 professional pitchers before spring training from 2009 to 2012. Shoulder external rotation (ER) and internal rotation (IR) ROM were assessed in 90° of abduction with the scapula stabilized. Humeral torsion was measured via ultrasound using previously described and validated methods. Side-to-side differences in total arc of motion (ER + IR), ER, and IR ROM and humeral torsion were calculated as nondominant minus dominant arm measures for analysis. Pitchers were classified as having GIRD if their dominant arm displayed an IR deficit ≥15° concomitant with a total arc of motion deficit ≥10° compared with their nondominant arm. A mixed-model analysis of variance (side × GIRD) was used to compare dominant and nondominant humeral torsion between pitchers with GIRD (n = 60) and those without GIRD (n = 162). Independent t tests were used to compare the side-to-side difference in humeral torsion between pitchers with GIRD and those without GIRD (α = 0.05).
RESULTS: Pitchers with GIRD displayed significantly less humeral torsion (ie, greater retrotorsion) in their dominant arm as compared with those without GIRD (GIRD = 4.5° ± 11.8°, no GIRD = 10.4° ± 11.7°; P = .002). Pitchers with GIRD also displayed a greater side-to-side difference in humeral torsion (GIRD = 19.5° ± 11.9°, no GIRD = 12.3° ± 12.4°; P = .001). However, pitchers with GIRD did not display an increase in dominant ER ROM (dominant ER = 131.8° ± 14.3°, nondominant ER 126.6° ± 13.1°) when compared with those without GIRD (dominant ER = 132.0° ± 14.2°, nondominant ER 122.6° ± 13.1°; P = .03). Pitchers with GIRD displayed expected alterations in ROM (IR = 28.8° ± 9.6°, total arc = 160.6° ± 15.4°; P < .01 for both) when compared with those without GIRD (IR = 39.9° ± 9.9°, total arc = 171.2° ± 15.5°).
CONCLUSION: Pitchers with GIRD displayed greater side-to-side differences and dominant humeral retrotorsion as compared with those without GIRD. The greater humeral retrotorsion may place greater stress on the posterior shoulder resulting in ROM deficits. Pitchers with greater humeral retrotorsion appear to be more susceptible to developing ROM deficits associated with injury and may need increased monitoring and customized treatment programs to mitigate their increased injury risk.

N2  - The aim of this study was to assess the potential of employing a classification tool to objectively classify participants with clinically assessed movement faults (MFs) of the scapula. Six participants with a history of shoulder pain with MFs of the scapula and 12 healthy participants with no movement faults (NMFs) performed a flexion movement control test of the scapula, while scapular kinematic data were collected. Principal component scores and discrete kinematic variables were used as input into a classifier. Five out of the six participants with a history of pain were successfully classified as having scapular MFs with an accuracy of 72%. Variables related to the upward rotation of the scapula had the most influence on the classification. The results of the study demonstrate the potential of adopting a multivariate approach in objective classification of participants with altered scapular kinematics in pathological groups.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coracoid transfer to a large glenoid defect is considered an excellent method to restore the surface area of the anteroinferior glenoid. However, there is little quantitative evidence supporting whether a coracoid graft can sufficiently restore the glenoid arc.
PURPOSE: To assess whether the Latarjet procedure can sufficiently restore the surface area of the glenoid.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.
METHODS: A total of 44 patients who underwent a Latarjet operation for a large glenoid defect between February 2009 and July 2011 were enrolled in this study. Three-dimensional computed tomography was used to calculate the surface areas of the preoperative glenoid defect size and the reconstructed glenoid. Preoperative and postoperative clinical results also were assessed.
RESULTS: At the last follow-up, the mean visual analog scale score for instability during motion improved significantly from 5.1 points (range, 3-10 points) preoperatively to 1.3 points (range, 0-4 points) (P<.001). The mean deficit in external rotation at the side, external rotation at 90° of abduction, and internal rotation to the posterior were 10°±20°, 7°±16°, and 1.9°±4°, respectively (P=.004, .022, and .009, respectively). The overall recurrence rate was 4.5% (2 of 44 shoulders). The mean preoperative glenoid defect size was 157±38 mm2 (range, 141-239 mm2; 25.3%±6% of the intact glenoid surface). The mean surface area of the coracoid graft used for reconstruction was 152±34 mm2 (range, 146-236 mm2; 24.8%±5% of the intact glenoid surface). After the Latarjet procedure, the mean surface area of the reconstructed glenoid was 706±32 mm2 (range, 639-749 mm2). Finally, postoperative glenoid defect size was 5±11 mm2 (range, 3-28 mm2; 1.5%±2% of the intact glenoid surface).
CONCLUSION: The Latarjet procedure can provide satisfactory outcomes, including a low recurrence rate and reliable functional recovery. Defects at the anteroinferior glenoid were restored to nearly normal after coracoid transfer by use of the Latarjet procedure, which is an anatomically matched reconstruction.

N2  - This paper presents development of statistical shape models based on robust and rigid-groupwise registration followed by pointset nonrigid registration. The main advantages of the pipeline include automation in that the method does not rely on manual landmarks or a regionalization step; there is no bias in the choice of reference during the correspondence steps and the use of the probabilistic principal component analysis framework increases the domain of the shape variability. A comparison between the widely used expectation maximization-iterative closest point algorithm and a recently reported groupwise method on publicly available data (hippocampus) using the well-known criteria of generality, specificity, and compactness is also presented. The proposed method gives similar values but the curves of generality and specificity are superior to those of the other two methods. Finally, the method is applied to the human scapula, which is a known difficult structure, and the human humerus.

N2  - The purpose of this study was (1) to determine the relationships between the degree of forward scapular posture and the pectoralis minor index, the strength of the serratus anterior, the thoracic spine angle, and posterior shoulder tightness, and (2) to identify predictors of forward scapular posture, including posterior shoulder tightness. The study recruited eighteen subjects with forward scapular posture and objectively measured the acromion distance, the pectoralis minor index, and the strength of the serratus anterior muscle of each participant. The amount of glenohumeral horizontal adduction and internal rotation were evaluated to measure posterior shoulder tightness. There were high intra-rater reliabilities in all measurements. The measurement results showed a statistically strong negative correlation between the degree of forward scapular posture and the pectoralis minor index. They also revealed a moderate positive correlation between the degree of forward scapular posture and the thoracic spine angle and a moderate negative relationship between the degree of forward scapular posture and the amount of the glenohumeral horizontal adduction. A multiple regression analysis indicated that a total multiple regression model explained 93% of the amount of forward scapular posture. All predictor variables, including posterior shoulder tightness, should be considered while assessing, managing, and preventing forward scapular posture.

N2  - » Three main theories explain the pathogenesis of the disabled throwing shoulder: the internal impingement theory, the posterior capsular contracture theory, and the scapulothoracic function theory. » The throwing shoulder demonstrates a unique musculoskeletal profile of asymmetrically increased external rotation and decreased internal rotation with preservation of the total arc of motion (external rotation plus internal rotation) when compared with the contralateral shoulder. Most investigators agree that the total arc of motion should not exceed 186°. A 5° asymmetry in the total arc of motion can be predictive of increased injury risk. » The three-dimensional motions of the scapula associated with arm motion during throwing demonstrate a consistent positioning of retraction, upward rotation, posterior tilt, and internal/external rotation for optimal glenohumeral stability. Discrepancies from this pattern have been associated with injury. » Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with the shoulder positioned in abduction and external rotation can improve the accuracy of diagnosing SLAP (superior labrum, anterior to posterior) tears and partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. » A minimalist approach should be taken when treating partial rotator cuff tears. Surgical repair should prevent tear progression while not limiting the substantial range of motion that is required for throwing.

N2  - BACKGROUND: According to worldwide statistics, internal fixation was commonly selected to treat patients with distal femoral fractures and acromioclavicular joint dislocation. The firmness of Kirschner wire is poor during fixation, so needle withdrawal easily appears, and the fixation would be failure. To reduce complications after fixation, AO/ASIF clavicular hook plate as a novel fixator has been used in treatment of distal clavicle fractures and acromioclavicular joint dislocation. OBJECTIVE: To explore the safety and effectiveness of AO/ASIF clavicular hook plate in the treatment of distal clavicle fractures and acromioclavicular dislocation, and to compare with Kirschner wire tension band. METHODS: 100 patients with distal clavicle fractures and acromioclavicular joint dislocation, who were treated in the Department of Orthopedics of Tongcheng People’s Hospital from June 2010 to December 2013, were enrolled in this study. They were equally assigned into Kirschner wire tension band group and AO/ASIF clavicular hook plate group according to different fixation methods. The excellent and good rate of shoulder function recovery, shoulder function score and upper limb functional recovery were observed and compared between the two groups after fixation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The excellent and good rate of shoulder function recovery was 98% in the AO/ASIF clavicular hook plate group after fixation, which was significantly higher than Kirschner wire tension band group (64%). The incidence of acromioclavicular re-dislocation was 0 after removal of fixator in the AO/ASIF clavicular hook plate group, which was lower than Kirschner wire tension band group (12%), showing significant differences between groups (P < 0.05). Japanese Orthopaedic Association score was significantly higher at 5 and 10 weeks after fixation in both groups compared with pre-fixation. Japanese Orthopaedic Association score was significantly higher in the AO/ASIF clavicular hook plate group than in the Kirschner wire tension band group (P < 0.05). The ranges of motion of adduction, abduction, flexion and extension were significantly higher in the AO/ASIF clavicular hook plate group than in the Kirschner wire tension band group at 10 weeks after fixation (P < 0.05). Above results suggested that AO/ASIF clavicular hook plate is a safe effective fixator for repair of distal clavicle fractures and acromioclavicular joint dislocation, and characterized by small incision, reliable fixation, and early shoulder activities.

N2  - Background Compound tibial fractures with extensive comminution and soft tissue defects are limb-threatening reconstructive challenges. The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term outcomes and the reliability of the latissimus dorsi scapula flap for this indication. Methods The hospital records of 26 compound tibial fracture patients treated with the latissimus dorsi scapula flap were reviewed. An overall assessment was performed in several steps based on a preinformation and two function-related questionnaires together with radiographs, clinical overviews, and functional tests. Results In 85% of the cases, the fractures had resulted from high-energy trauma and had extensive zone of injury. The mean follow-up time was 6.2 years. Nine patients required reconstruction because of prolonged sequelae after infection, nonunion, or tissue deficiency. One flap loss occurred leading to amputation. Six patients required an additional operation to enhance bony union. Full weight-bearing was allowed in 3 months and the mean time to bony union was 10 months. Overall, 90% returned to their pretrauma occupation. Overall 11 patients were lost to follow-up. A total of 14 patients answered the questionnaires whereas 12 outpatients attended the clinical assessment. The main finding after evaluating the results of the functional tests and reviewing the questionnaires was the limitation in ankle movement while the donor site performed well. Conclusion This study confirms that osteomuscular latissimus dorsi scapula flap reconstruction is a suitable alternative for compound and comminuted tibia fractures especially in the case of extensive soft tissue injury with bony loss or significant comminution and with high probability of amputation.

N2  - The participation of scapula motion in arm movement is clinically well known and recent three dimensional (3D) analyses using kinematic techniques have confirmed its importance. Scapular motion relative to the thorax has a theoretical maximum of 6 degrees of freedom (DoF), resulting from rotations at both clavicular joints (3 rotational DoF each). However, most recent kinematic studies have only analysed the 3D rotations of the scapula relative to the thorax. In the present study, the 3D translations of the barycentre of the scapula were considered in order to complete the description of movement at the shoulder complex. Eight healthy subjects performed arm elevation in the sagittal and frontal planes, simulated activities of daily living (hair combing and back washing) and maximum voluntary scapula movement (forward and backward rolling). Measurements were recorded using a 6 DoF electromagnetic device and the acromial method of analysis was used. The results showed that 3D scapular rotations and translation of its barycentre were functionally consistent for all tasks. A principal component analysis (PCA) yielded three factors, explaining 97.6% of the variance. The first two factors (protraction and shrug, according to clinical descriptions) combined rotations and translations, consistent with the hypothesis that the scapula rolls over the curved thoracic surface. The third factor related to lateral-medial rotation, thus representing rotation in the plane tangential to the thorax. The PCA suggested that scapular motion can be described using these 3 DoF. This should be studied in a larger group of individuals, including patients with pathological conditions.

N2  - A robust and reproducible scapular coordinate system is necessary to study scapulothoracic kinematics. The coordinate system recommended by the ISB (International Society of Biomechanics) is difficult to apply in studies using medical imaging, which mostly use a glenoid-centered coordinate system. The aim of this study was to assess the robustness of a glenoid-centered coordinate system compared with the ISB coordinate system, and to study the reproducibility of this coordinate system measure during abduction. A Monte-Carlo analysis was performed to test the robustness of the two coordinate systems. This method enabled the variability of the orientation of the coordinate system to be assessed in a laboratory setting. A reproducibility study of the glenoid-centered coordinate system in the thorax reference frame was performed during abduction in the scapular plane using a low-dose stereoradiography system. We showed that the glenoid-centered coordinate system was slightly more robust than the ISB-recommended coordinate system. Most reproducible rotation was upward/downward rotation (x axis) and most reproducible translation was along the Y axis (superior-inferior translation). In conclusion, the glenoid-centered coordinate system can be used with confidence for scapular kinematics analysis. The uncertainty of the measures derived from our technique is acceptable compared with that reported in the literature. Functional quantitative analysis of the scapulothoracic joint is possible with this method.

N2  - Several studies have recently investigated how the implementations of acromion marker clusters (AMCs) method and stereo-photogrammetry affect the estimates of scapula kinematics. However, in the large majority of these studies, the accuracy assessment of the scapular kinematics obtained with AMCs was carried out through a comparative evaluation using a scapula locator that is prone to error. The present study assesses AMC accuracy based on best practice recommendations, both with single and double anatomical calibration implementations, during several passive shoulder movements. Experiments were carried out on three cadaveric specimens. The scapula motion was acquired with a stereo-photogrammetric system using intra-cortical pins. When the scapula kinematics was estimated using an AMC combined with a single anatomical calibration, the accuracy was highly dependent on the specimen and the type of motion (maximum errors between -6.2° and 44.8°) and the scapular motion was generally overestimated. Moreover, with this implementation, scapular orientation errors increased for shoulder configurations distant from the reference shoulder configuration chosen for the calibration procedure. The double calibration implementation greatly improved the estimate of the scapular kinematics for all specimens and types of motion (maximum errors between -1.0° and 14.2°). The double anatomical calibration implementation should be preferred since it reduces the kinematics errors to levels which are acceptable in most clinical applications.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Hill-Sachs lesions are compression fractures that result from shoulder dislocation. They involve "engaging" the humeral head on the anterior glenoid rim when the arm is abducted and externally rotated. The defect grows as the number of dislocations increases.
HYPOTHESIS: Arthroscopic remplissage and anterior Bankart repair do not significantly affect infraspinatus strength while ensuring healing of the capsulotenodesis.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: Sixty-one patients with traumatic anterior shoulder instability treated by arthroscopic Bankart repair and Hill-Sachs remplissage at least 24 months previously were compared with a control group of 40 healthy participants. Preoperative imaging included magnetic resonance imaging for Bankart lesion identification and computed tomography to quantify the humeral head defect. Active range of motion and clinical scores (Walch-Duplay, Constant-Murley, and Rowe) were assessed. External rotation (ER) and internal rotation (IR) were measured with arm at the side (ER1 and IR1) and abducted at 90° (ER2 and IR2). Infraspinatus strength was assessed with the scapula free (infraspinatus strength test [IST]) and retracted (infraspinatus scapula retraction test [ISRT]). Infraspinatus tenodesis and posterior capsulodesis healing were evaluated by ultrasound (US).
RESULTS: The follow-up median was 39.5 months (range, 24-56 months). One patient experienced a recurrence of instability at 34 months. In the remplissage patients, ER1 was significantly lower in the affected compared with the unaffected shoulder (P < .001). Mean IST and ISRT strength values did not show differences between sides. The mean Constant-Murley score rose from 62.9 ± 7.1 to 90 ± 5.2 (P < .0001). The Walch-Duplay and Rowe scores were excellent in 23 (78.6%), good in 6 (17.8%), and poor in 1 patient (both scores). The remplissage group had significantly lower ER1 (P < .001), ER2 (P < .001), and IR2 (P < .01) values compared with the control group. Differences in IST and ISRT between the groups were not significant. Capsulotenodesis healing and filling of the Hill-Sachs defect were confirmed by dynamic US in all subjects.
CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic remplissage is a reliable approach to Hill-Sachs lesions. The ER and IR restriction does not significantly affect quality of life. Infraspinatus strength recovery is satisfactory even compared with healthy subjects. Ultrasound examination allows accurate evaluation of capsulotenodesis healing.

N2  - CONTEXT: Proper scapular function during humeral elevation, such as upward rotation, external rotation, and posterior tilting of the scapula, is necessary to prevent shoulder injury. However, the appropriate intensity of rehabilitation exercise for the periscapular muscles has yet to be clarified.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the serratus anterior, lower trapezius, infraspinatus, and posterior deltoid muscle activities during 2 free-motion exercises using 3 intensities and to compare these muscle activities with isometric contractions during quadruped shoulder flexion and external rotation and abduction of the glenohumeral joint.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Health Science Laboratory.
PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 16 uninjured, healthy, active, male college students (age = 19.5 ± 1.2 years, height = 173.1 ± 6.5 cm, weight = 68.8 ± 6.6 kg).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Mean electromyographic activity normalized by the maximal voluntary isometric contraction was analyzed across 3 intensities and 5 exercises. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for electromyographic activity of the 4 muscles in each free-motion exercise.
RESULTS: Significant interactions in electromyographic activity were observed between intensities and exercises (P < .05). The quadruped shoulder-flexion exercise activated all 4 muscles compared with other exercises. Also, the modified robbery free-motion exercise activated the serratus anterior, lower trapezius, and infraspinatus compared with the lawn-mower free-motion exercise. However, neither exercise showed a difference in posterior deltoid electromyographic activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Three intensities exposed the nature of the periscapular muscle activities across the different exercises. The free-motion exercise in periscapular muscle rehabilitation may not modify serratus anterior, lower trapezius, and infraspinatus muscle activities unless knee-joint extension is limited.

N2  - Upper limb (UL) kinematic assessment protocols are becoming integrated into clinical practice due to their development over the last few years. We propose the ELEPAP UL protocol, a contemporary UL kinematic protocol that can be applied to different pathological conditions. This model is based on ISB modeling recommendations, uses functional joint definitions, and models three joints of the shoulder girdle. The specific aim of this study was to determine the within and between session reliability of the ELEPAP UL model. Ten healthy subjects (mean age: 13.6±4.3 years) performed four reach-to-grasp and five functional tasks, which included a novel throwing task to assess a wide spectrum of motor skills. Three trials of every task in two different sessions were analyzed. The reliability of angular waveforms was evaluated by measurement error (σ) and coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC). Spatiotemporal parameters were assessed by standard error of measurement (SEM). Generally joint kinematics presented low σw and σb errors (<100). A selection of angular waveforms errors was presented to inspect error fluctuation in different phases, which was found to be related to the demands of the different movements. CMCw and CMCb values (>0.60) were found, demonstrating good to excellent reliability especially in joints with larger ranges of motion. The throwing task proved equally reliable, enhancing the universal application of the protocol. Compared to the literature, this study demonstrated higher reliability of the thorax, scapula and wrist joints. This was attributed to the highly standardized procedure and the implementation of recent methodological advancements. In conclusion, ELEPAP protocol was proved a reliable tool to analyze UL kinematics.

N2  - Background: Following neonatal brachial plexus palsy, the Putti sign - obligatory tilt of the scapula with brachiothoracic adduction - suggests the presence of glenohumeral abduction contracture. In the present study, we utilized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify this glenohumeral abduction contracture and evaluate its relationship to shoulder joint deformity, muscle atrophy, and function. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed MRIs of the thorax and shoulders obtained before and after shoulder rebalancing surgery (internal rotation contracture release and external rotation tendon transfer) for twenty-eight children with unresolved neonatal brachial plexus palsy. Two raters measured the coronal positions of the scapula, thoracic spine, and humeral shaft bilaterally on coronal images, correcting trigonometrically for scapular protraction on axial images. Supraspinatus, deltoid, and latissimus dorsi muscle atrophy was assessed, blinded to other measures. Correlations between glenohumeral abduction contracture and glenoid version, humeral head subluxation, passive external rotation, and Mallet shoulder function before and after surgery were performed. Results: MRI measurements were highly reliable between raters. Glenohumeral abduction contractures were present in twenty-five of twenty-eight patients, averaging 33° (range, 10° to 65°). Among those patients, abductor atrophy was present in twenty-three of twenty-five, with adductor atrophy in twelve of twenty-five. Preoperatively, greater abduction contracture severity correlated with greater Mallet global abduction and hand-to-neck function. Abduction contracture severity did not correlate preoperatively with axial measurements of glenohumeral dysplasia, but greater glenoid retroversion was associated with worse abduction contractures postoperatively. Surgery improved passive external rotation, active abduction, and hand-to-neck function, but did not change the abduction contracture. Conclusions: A majority of patients with persistent shoulder weakness following neonatal brachial plexus palsy have glenohumeral abduction deformities, with contractures as severe as 65°. The abduction contracture occurs with abductor atrophy, with or without associated adductor atrophy. This contracture may improve global shoulder abduction by positioning the glenohumeral joint in abduction. Glenohumeral and scapulothoracic kinematics and muscle pathology must be further elucidated to advance an understanding of the etiology and the prevention and treatment of the complex shoulder deformity following neonatal brachial plexus palsy. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

N2  - Background: Current techniques for resurfacing of the glenoid in the treatment of arthritis are unpredictable. Computed tomography (CT) studies have demonstrated that the medial tibial plateau has close similarity to the glenoid. The purpose of this study was to assess contact pressures of transplanted massive tibial osteochondral allografts to resurface the glenoid without and with CT matching. Methods: Ten unmatched cadaveric tibiae were used to resurface 10 cadaveric glenoids with osteochondral allografts. Five cadaveric tibiae and glenoids were CT matched and studied. An internal control group of 4 matched pairs of glenoids, with the contralateral glenoid transplanted to the opposite glenoid, was also included as a best-case scenario to measure the effects of the surgical technique. All glenoids were tested before and after grafting at different abduction and rotation angles, with recording of peak contact pressures. Results: Peak contact pressures were not different from the intact state in the autografted group but were increased in both allografted groups. CT-matched tibial grafts had lower peak pressures than unmatched grafts. Peak pressures were on average 24.8% (range [18.3%, 29.6%]) greater than in the native glenoids for unmatched allografts, 21.8% ([17.0%, 25.5%]) greater for the matched allografts, and 4.9% ([3.8%, 5.5%]) greater for matched autografts. Conclusion: Osteochondral grafting from the medial tibial plateau to the glenoid is feasible but results in increased peak contact pressures. The technique is reproducible as defined by the autografted group. Contact pressures between native and allografted glenoids were significantly different. The clinical significance remains unknown. Peak pressures experienced by the glenoid seem highly sensitive to deviations from the native glenoid shape.

N2  - It is suggested that scapular joint position sense (JPS) contributes to scapular stability. However, there is a lack of studies describing the measurement method for three-dimensional (3D) scapular JPS. The purposes of this study were to investigate the measurement repeatability and validity of the scapular JPS, and examine the effect of arm dominance on the scapular JPS in asymptomatic young adults. Ten subjects participated in this study. The scapular JPS was measured as scapular reposition errors during scapular elevation, depression, protraction, and retraction. Both the 3D scapular kinematics and clinical scale rule measurement were recorded during the test. The results showed that the measurement of scapular reposition errors resulted in moderate to excellent within-day intra-rater reliability with intraclass correlation coefficient ICC<inf>(3,2)</inf> between 0.60 and 0.99 for 3D scapular rotations, between 0.56 and 0.96 for 3D scapular displacement, and between 0.73 and 0.98 for the clinical scale ruler measurement. Scapular reposition errors measured using a 3D electromagnetic tracking device and using a scale ruler had a significant relationship (r=0.74-0.98). There was no significant difference in scapular reposition errors between the dominant and non-dominant shoulders. Our findings indicated that both the 3D tracking device and scale ruler resulted in a reliable measurement of scapular JPS and the clinical measurement method could be used to provide valid data for scapular JPS evaluation. In addition, arm dominance did not influence the scapular JPS in asymptomatic young adults.

N2  - Study design: Randomized clinical trial. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust manipulations (HVLATMs) and various messages on patients with musculoskeletal shoulder symptoms. Background: Previous studies indicated that HVLATM directed at the thoracic spine and ribs resulted in improvements of shoulder range of motion, pain, and disability in patients with musculoskeletal shoulder symptoms. These studies did not explore if the outcome was dependent on thrust location, clinician communication with the patient, or if there were any lasting effects. Methods: A consecutive sample of 100 patients with shoulder pain was randomized into four groups. Patients received one intervention session including: six thoracic HVLATM (spine versus scapula), a message about HVLATM (neutral versus positive), and standardized home exercises. Outcome measures included shoulder Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), NPRS with impingement testing, and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). Measurements were recorded prior to intervention, immediately following intervention, and at short-term follow-up. Kruskal–Wallis statistics were used for between-group comparisons and Wilcoxon signed ranks for within-group comparisons. Results: Eighty-eight patients (22 per group) completed the study. Statistically significant differences were found for within-group comparisons for most time points assessed. No statistical differences were found for between-group comparisons. Conclusion: Patients improved following the interventions. Neither the type of HVLATM nor the message conveyed to the patients had a significant effect on the patients’ improvements. Level of evidence: 1b.

N2  - Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of transfer of the sternal head of the pectoralis major with its bone insertion to the inferior pole of the scapula for symptomatic winging. Methods: Our study included 51 patients with serratus anterior dysfunction secondary to chronic muscle or long thoracic nerve injury. Indications included pain, scapular winging, and limited active motion after failed conservative management. All patients underwent transfer of the sternal head of the pectoralis major with its bone insertion to the scapular inferior pole. Computed tomography scan was performed at 3months postoperatively to evaluate bone healing. Results: At an average follow-up of 29months (range, 12-46 months), 45 patients had complete and 6 patients had partial resolution of the scapular winging. Patients had significant improvements in their shoulder abduction, forward flexion, and pain levels (. P<.01). The mean shoulder Constant score improved from 49 preoperatively to 82 postoperatively; the shoulder subjective value improved from 60% to 84%; and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score improved from 58 to 14 (. P<.01). Computed tomography scans at an average of 3months postoperatively demonstrated full healing in 41 patients and partial healing in10. Conclusion: Pectoralis major transfer of the sternal head with its bone insertion to the inferior pole of the scapula is a reliable transfer to stabilize and to restore the function of the scapula in patients with symptomatic winging. This technique allows the ability to directly transfer the tendon to the scapula with bone-to-bone healing, leading to faster healing and a quicker return to unrestricted activities.

N2  - Background: Assessment of scapular dyskinesis (SD) is of clinical interest, as SD is believed to be related to shoulder pathology. However, no clinical assessment with sufficient reliability to identify SD and provide treatment strategies is available. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of the comprehensive SD classification method. Design: Cross-sectional reliability study. Method: Sixty subjects with unilateral shoulder pain were evaluated by two independent physiotherapists with a visual-based palpation method. SD was classified as single abnormal scapular pattern [inferior angle (pattern I), medial border (pattern II), superior border of scapula prominence or abnormal scapulohumeral rhythm (pattern III)], a mixture of the above abnormal scapular patterns, or normal pattern (pattern IV). The assessment of SD was evaluated as subjects performed bilateral arm raising/lowering movements with a weighted load in the scapular plane. Percentage of agreement and kappa coefficients were calculated to determine reliability. Results: Agreement between the 2 independent physiotherapists was 83% (50/60, 6 subjects as pattern III and 44 subjects as pattern IV) in the raising phase and 68% (41/60, 5 subjects as pattern I, 12 subjects as pattern II, 12 subjects as pattern IV, 12 subjects as mixed patterns I and II) in the lowering phase. The kappa coefficients were 0.49-0.64. Conclusions: We concluded that the visual-based palpation classification method for SD had moderate to substantial inter-rater reliability. The appearance of different types of SD was more pronounced in the lowering phase than in the raising phase of arm movements.

N2  - The measurement of dynamic scapular kinematics is complex due to the sliding nature of the scapula beneath the skin surface. The aim of the study was to clearly describe the acromion marker cluster (AMC) method of determining scapular kinematics when using a passive marker motion capture system, with consideration for the sources of error which could affect the validity and reliability of measurements. The AMC method involves placing a cluster of markers over the posterior acromion, and through calibration of anatomical landmarks with respect to the marker cluster it is possible to obtain valid measurements of scapular kinematics. The reliability of the method was examined between two days in a group of 15 healthy individuals (aged 19-38 years, eight males) as they performed arm elevation, to 120°, and lowering in the frontal, scapular and sagittal planes. Results showed that between-day reliability was good for upward scapular rotation (Coefficient of Multiple Correlation; CMC = 0.92) and posterior tilt (CMC = 0.70) but fair for internal rotation (CMC = 0.53) during the arm elevation phase. The waveform error was lower for upward rotation (2.7° to 4.4°) and posterior tilt (1.3° to 2.8°), compared to internal rotation (5.4° to 7.3°). The reliability during the lowering phase was comparable to results observed during the elevation phase. If the protocol outlined in this study is adhered to, the AMC provides a reliable measurement of upward rotation and posterior tilt during the elevation and lowering phases of arm movement.

N2  - Background: Primary osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common cause of pain arising from the acromioclavicular (AC) joint. The true incidence is unknown because of differences in the criteria used to define arthritis in various studies. The proper diagnosis of AC joint OA requires a thorough physical examination, radiographic findings, and a diagnostic local anesthetic injection. Objective: The goal of this study was to assess the effects and safety of ultrasound (US) versus palpation-guided acromioclavicular (AC) joint intra-articular (IA) corticosteroid injection for patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the AC joint. Study Design: Retrospective, compared clinical study. Setting: University hospital outpatient pain clinic. Method: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients with AC joint degenerative OA who had undergone US or palpation-guided AC joint IA corticosteroid injection between January 2012 and December 2013 at our outpatient clinic. One hundred consecutive patients identified from chart review met inclusion criteria. Patients (N = 50) in US guide AC joint IA steroid injection group were administered a mixture of 0.5% lidocaine (1 mL) with triamcinolone (20 mg/mL; 0.5 mL) and radiographic contrast material (0.5 mL) and patients (N = 50) in palpation-guided AC joint IA steroid injection group were administered a mixture of 0.5% lidocaine (1 mL) with triamcinolone (20 mg/mL; 0.5 mL) and 0.5 mL of radiographic contrast material. Results were measured using the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Verbal Numeric pain Scale (VNS) at rest (VNSar), under local pressure (VNSlp) ,and the arm adduction test (VNSaat) at the joint space area before injections and at one, 3, and 6 months after the injections. Successful treatment occurred when patients obtained significant pain relief (as measured by > 50% improvement in the VNS score and 20 point improvement in the SPADI) at one, 3, and 6 months after the injections. Univariable analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between possible outcome predictors and therapeutic effect by using a chi-square test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess whether injection method, injection accuracy, patients’ age, gender, and duration of the disease were independent predictors of successful outcome. Results: SPADI, VNSaat, VNSlp, and VNSar improved at one, 3, and 6 months after the injections in both groups. There was a statistically significantly greater improvement in the VNSlp score and SPDAI at 6 months and in the VNSaat score at 3 months and 6 months for US-guided group as compared with the palpation group. Successful treatment is defined as significant differences found between the groups or from the 3-month to 6-month outcomes. Multiple logistic regression and univariable analysis showed that the significant outcome predictors at 6-month follow-up was the injection accuracy. Limitations: Limitations include the retrospective nature of the study, lack of evaluation of longterm effects , most of the injections were performed in patients with a BMI of less than 30 kg/m2, and the treatment procedures were conducted by the same physician. Conclusion: US-guided AC joint IA injection for the treatment of symptomatic AC joint OA resulted in better pain and functional status improvement than palpation-guided IA injection at the 6-month follow-up.

N2  - Noninvasive methods enabling measurement of shoulder bone positions are paramount in clinical and ergonomics applications. In this study, the acromion marker cluster (AMC) method is assessed in comparison with a model-based approach allowing scapula tracking from low-dose biplanar radiograph images. Six healthy male subjects participated in this study. Data acquisition was performed for 6 arm abduction positions (0°, 45°, 90°, 120°, 150°, 180°). Scapula rotations were calculated using the coordinate systems and angle sequence was defined by the ISB. The comparison analysis was based on root mean square error (RMSE) calculation and nonparametric statistical tests. RMSE remained under 8° for 0° to 90° arm abduction and under 13.5° for 0° to 180° abduction; no significant differences were found between the 2 methods. Compared with previous works, an improved accuracy of the AMC approach at high arm abduction positions was obtained. This could be explained by the different sources of data used as the "gold standard."

N2  - Objective. To assess the correlation of abnormal trunk postures and reposition sense of subjects with forward head neck posture (FHP). Methods. In all, postures of 41 subjects were evaluated and the FHP and trunk posture including shoulder, scapular level, pelvic side, and anterior tilting degrees were analyzed. We used the head repositioning accuracy (HRA) test to evaluate neck position senses of neck flexion, neck extension, neck right and left side flexion, and neck right and left rotation and calculated the root mean square error in trials for each subject. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and regression analysis were used to assess the degree of correlation between the trunk posture and HRA value, and a significance level of = 0.05 was considered. Results. There were significant correlations between the HRA value of right side neck flexion and pelvic side tilt angle (p<0.05). If pelvic side tilting angle increases by 1 degree, right side neck flexion increased by 0.76 degrees (p=0.026). However, there were no significant correlations between other neck motions and trunk postures. Conclusion. Verifying pelvic postures should be prioritized when movement is limited due to the vitiation of the proprioceptive sense of neck caused by FHP.

N2  - Introduction: Intrarater reliability of inclinometer scapular upward rotation measures was determined over a two-week period among unimpaired females prior to a larger study on women with breast cancer. Methods: A measurement-focused study was performed at a university laboratory. Following institutional review board approval, a convenience sample of 15 unimpaired females were recruited. Measures were taken 3 times at each position (0°, 90°, and 120° of glenohumeral elevation) during two sessions that were two weeks apart. The position order for testing was randomized and the rater was blinded to actual degree numbers. Interclass correlation coefficients [ICC (3,k)] and standard error of the measure (SEM) assessed reliability with probability at P ≤ .05 (two tailed) for significance and a test value of .90. Results: Overall agreement was significant (ICC = .953; P < .001) with an SEM of ± 4.42°. Secondary analysis by position found significant agreement at 120° (ICC = .968; P = .001); but not at 0° (ICC = .908; P = .416) or at 90° (ICC = .892; P = .567). SEM by position were: ± 2.02° (0°), ± 4.73° (90°), and ± 5.63 (120°). Limitations are the small sample and inability to generalize results to multiple raters or clinical populations. Conclusion: Results suggest good overall intrarater test-retest reliability for research and values are provided for SEM as a relative index for reliability. Further study is required by using a larger sample to confirm study results and to generalize findings to the breast cancer population.

N2  - The aims were to compile a schematic overview of clinical scapular assessment methods and critically appraise the methodological quality of the involved studies. A systematic, computer-assisted literature search using Medline, CINAHL, SportDiscus and EMBASE was performed from inception to October 2013. Reference lists in articles were also screened for publications. From 50 articles, 54 method names were identified and categorized into three groups: (1) Static positioning assessment (n = 19); (2) Semi-dynamic (n = 13); and (3) Dynamic functional assessment (n = 22). Fifteen studies were excluded for evaluation due to no/few clinimetric results, leaving 35 studies for evaluation. Graded according to the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN checklist), the methodological quality in the reliability and validity domains was "fair" (57%) to "poor" (43%), with only one study rated as "good". The reliability domain was most often investigated. Few of the assessment methods in the included studies that had "fair" or "good" measurement property ratings demonstrated acceptable results for both reliability and validity. We found a substantially larger number of clinical scapular assessment methods than previously reported. Using the COSMIN checklist the methodological quality of the included measurement properties in the reliability and validity domains were in general "fair" to "poor". None were examined for all three domains: (1) reliability; (2) validity; and (3) responsiveness. Observational evaluation systems and assessment of scapular upward rotation seem suitably evidence-based for clinical use. Future studies should test and improve the clinimetric properties, and especially diagnostic accuracy and responsiveness, to increase utility for clinical practice.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Post-burn cicatricle contractures of neck pose a challenge for plastic and reconstructive surgeons. To improve functional and cosmetic results, and to minimize the donor-site morbidity, we use pre-expanded cervico-acromial fasciocutaneous flap based on the supraclavicular artery as a feasible choice for resurfacing large skin defects of the neck.
METHODS: In this series, from 2008 to 2012, 18 patients with ages ranging between 11 and 42 years (20 flaps with 2 patients in bilateral fashion) suffering from post-burn scar contractures of the neck were treated. In the first stage, an expander was implanted on the deep fascia layer of the cervico-acromial region; 600 to 800 mL of saline was then injected during a 10- to 16-week period. In the second stage after expansion, sufficient skin and tissue was obtained to resurface the defects of the neck after releasing the contractures and excision of post-burn scars.
RESULT: All 20 flaps healed primarily with good functional and cosmetic results. The maximum size was 23×16 cm, whereas the minimum was 20×8 cm. After an average follow-up time of 12 months, significant improvement in range of motion with good esthetic outcomes were achieved, and the scars in donor sites seemed acceptable. There ware no significant complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The pre-expanded cervico-acromial fasciocutaneous flap based on the supraclavicular artery can provide a large amount of thin tissue with both good color and texture, and without the need for microsurgery, and avoid the disadvantages of donor-site morbidity. This flap is reliable and safe for resurfacing large skin defects of the neck.

N2  - AIM: To determine whether rotator cuff strength, glenohumeral joint range of motion and scapular control are associated with shoulder injuries among elite male handball players.
METHODS: A total of 206 players in the Norwegian elite handball league for men were tested prior to the 2011-2012 season. Measures included: (1) glenohumeral internal and external rotation range of motion, (2) isometric internal rotation, external rotation and abduction strength and (3) assessment of scapular dyskinesis. Players were followed prospectively for the entire regular season (30 weeks), with shoulder problems registered bi-weekly using the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center Overuse Injury Questionnaire. A cumulative severity score was calculated for each player based on their questionnaire responses. This was used as the outcome measure in risk factor analyses.
RESULTS: The average prevalence of shoulder problems throughout the season was 28% (95% CI 25% to 31%). The prevalence of substantial shoulder problems, defined as those leading to moderate or severe reductions in handball participation or performance, or to time loss, was 12% (95% CI 11% to 13%). Significant associations were found between obvious scapular dyskinesis (OR 8.41, 95% CI 1.47 to 48.1, p<0.05), total rotational motion (OR 0.77 per 5° change, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.995, p<0.05) and external rotation strength (OR 0.71 per 10 Nm change, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.99, p<0.05) and shoulder injury.
CONCLUSIONS: Injury prevention programmes should incorporate interventions aimed at improving glenohumeral rotational range of motion, external rotation strength and scapular control.

N2  - Accurate representation of individual scapula kinematics and subject geometries is vital in musculoskeletal models applied to upper limb pathology and performance. In applying individual kinematics to a model[U+05F3]s cadaveric geometry, model constraints are commonly prescriptive. These rely on thorax scaling to effectively define the scapula[U+05F3]s path but do not consider the area underneath the scapula in scaling, and assume a fixed conoid ligament length. These constraints may not allow continuous solutions or close agreement with directly measured kinematics.A novel method is presented to scale the thorax based on palpated scapula landmarks. The scapula and clavicle kinematics are optimised with the constraint that the scapula medial border does not penetrate the thorax. Conoid ligament length is not used as a constraint. This method is simulated in the UK National Shoulder Model and compared to four other methods, including the standard technique, during three pull-up techniques (n=11). These are high-performance activities covering a large range of motion.Model solutions without substantial jumps in the joint kinematics data were improved from 23% of trials with the standard method, to 100% of trials with the new method. Agreement with measured kinematics was significantly improved (more than 10° closer at p<0.001) when compared to standard methods. The removal of the conoid ligament constraint and the novel thorax scaling correction factor were shown to be key. Separation of the medial border of the scapula from the thorax was large, although this may be physiologically correct due to the high loads and high arm elevation angles. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: It is well established that musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are a significant occupational health issue for dentists and hygienists. Despite this, there has been little advancement in the application of ergonomic principles in the dental profession. While the use of loupes is often promoted as an ergonomic solution, there is little published research to robustly support this claim. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the use of loupes on upper extremity MSD among dental hygienists.
METHODS: The study was conducted using an exploratory pretest and post-test design, comparing musculoskeletal measures in practising dental hygienists wearing loupes with final-year dental hygiene students who did not wear loupes. Pre- and post-test measures included valid self-reported and objective outcome measures and were measured at baseline and 6 months following the intervention. Statistical analysis was conducted as a series of mixed anovas with time and treatment as the independent variables.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed a significant interaction between time and treatment for the Disabilities of the Shoulder, Arm and Hand (DASH) scores (P < 0.04), indicating an improvement in symptoms for the treatment group but a reversed trend for the controls. There was also a significant mean increase in scapular position measures; however, this finding was evident in both groups, indicating that these were not a result of the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study suggests that wearing loupes appears to have both positive and negative effects on upper extremity MSD among dental hygienists. Ongoing research is required to determine the long-term effects of loupes wear, over an extended period of time.

N2  - Methods based on cutaneous markers are the most popular for the recording of three dimensional scapular motion analysis. Numerous methods have been evaluated, each showing different levels of accuracy and reliability. The aim of this review was to report the metrological properties of 3D scapular kinematic measurements using cutaneous markers and to make recommendations based on metrological evidence. A database search was conducted using relevant keywords and inclusion/exclusion criteria in 5 databases. 19 articles were included and assessed using a quality score. Concurrent validity and reliability were analyzed for each method. Six different methods are reported in the literature, each based on different marker locations and post collection computations. The acromion marker cluster (AMC) method coupled with a calibration of the scapula with the arm at rest is the most studied method. Below 90-100° of humeral elevation, this method is accurate to about 5° during arm flexion and 7° during arm abduction compared to palpation (average of the 3 scapular rotation errors). Good to excellent within-session reliability and moderate to excellent between-session reliability have been reported. The AMC method can be improved using different or multiple calibrations. Other methods using different marker locations or more markers on the scapula blade have been described but are less accurate than AMC methods. Based on current metrological evidence we would recommend (1) the use of an AMC located at the junction of the scapular spine and the acromion, (2) the use of a single calibration at rest if the task does not reach 90° of humeral elevation, (3) the use of a second calibration (at 90° or 120° of humeral elevation), or multiple calibrations above 90° of humeral elevation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Objective. The surgical procedure aims at anatomic reduction and stabilization of the acromioclavicular joint in vertical and horizontal planes for acute separations using a trans-clavicular and trans-coracoidal suture tape fixation with additional acromioclavicular joint augmentation with a PDS cord cerclage. For chronic instability adding a tendon graft is essential for sustainable stability. Indications. Acute und chronic acromioclavicular joint separations type Rockwood III-VI. Recurrent AC-joint instability with intact coracoid process (with tendon graft). Contraindications. Acromioclavicular joint separations type Rockwood I-II. Asymptomatic chronic AC-separations type Rockwood III-IV. Fracture close to base of coracoid process General contraindications for (elective) surgery. Surgical technique. Vertical reconstruction of the coraco-clavicular ligaments using a drill-guide for trans-clavicular and trans-coracoidal tunnel placement for high-strength suture tapes over titanium buttons. Additional stabilization of the AC-joint with a transosseus figure of 8 PDS suture cord cerclage. Postoperative management. Postoperatively the arm is put in a regular sling for 6 weeks. Free active range of motion of wrist and elbow. Shoulder range of motion is limited to 30° of flexion and abduction and 80° internal and 0° external rotation for 2 weeks. Extended to active-assisted 45° flexion and abduction in weeks 3 and 4 and advanced to 60° flexion/abduction and free internal/external rotation in weeks 5 and 6. Range of motion is unlimited from week 7. Full daily life activities after 3 months, high-impact sports after 5-6 months postoperatively. Results. The presented surgical technique reliably stabilizes the acromioclavicular joint. It's biomechanical properties with only the single-tunnel coracoclavicular suture tapes is on the level of the native vertical stability, which can be additionally improved for better horizontal stability with the cerclage over the AC-joint. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Scientific evidence supporting a role for faulty scapular positioning in patients with various shoulder disorders is cumulating. Clinicians who manage patients with shoulder pain and athletes at risk of developing shoulder pain need to have the skills to assess static and dynamic scapular positioning and dynamic control. Several methods for the assessment of scapular positioning are described in scientific literature. However, the majority uses expensive and specialised equipment (laboratory methods), making their use in clinical practice nearly impossible. On the basis of biometric and kinematic studies, guidelines for interpreting the observation of static and dynamic scapular positioning pattern in patients with shoulder pain are provided. At this point, clinicians can use reliable clinical tests for the assessment of both static and dynamic scapular positioning in patients with shoulder pain. However, this review also provides clinicians several possible pitfalls when performing clinical scapular evaluation. On the basis of its clinical relevance, its proven reliability, its relation to body length and its applicability in a clinical setting, this review recommends to assess the scapula both static (visual observation and acromial distance or Baylor/double square method for shoulder protraction) and semidynamic (visual observation and inclinometry for scapular upward rotation). In addition, when the patient demonstrates with shoulder impingement symptoms, the scapular repositioning test and scapular assistant test are recommended for relating the patients' symptoms to the position or movement of the scapula.

N2  - Background: Upright examination procedures like radiology, thermography, manual muscle testing, and spinal motion palpation may lead to spinal interventions with the patient prone. The reliability and accuracy of mapping upright examination findings to the prone position is unknown. This study had 2 primary goals: (1) investigate how erroneous spine-scapular landmark associations may lead to errors in treating and charting spine levels; and (2) study the interexaminer reliability of a novel method for mapping upright spinal sites to the prone position.Methods: Experiment 1 was a thought experiment exploring the consequences of depending on the erroneous landmark association of the inferior scapular tip with the T7 spinous process upright and T6 spinous process prone (relatively recent studies suggest these levels are T8 and T9, respectively). This allowed deduction of targeting and charting errors. In experiment 2, 10 examiners (2 experienced, 8 novice) used an index finger to maintain contact with a mid-thoracic spinous process as each of 2 participants slowly moved from the upright to the prone position. Interexaminer reliability was assessed by computing Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, standard error of the mean, root mean squared error, and the absolute value of the mean difference for each examiner from the 10 examiner mean for each of the 2 participants.Results: The thought experiment suggesting that using the (inaccurate) scapular tip landmark rule would result in a 3 level targeting and charting error when radiological findings are mapped to the prone position. Physical upright exam procedures like motion palpation would result in a 2 level targeting error for intervention, and a 3 level error for charting. The reliability experiment showed examiners accurately maintained contact with the same thoracic spinous process as the participant went from upright to prone, ICC (2,1) = 0.83.Conclusions: As manual therapists, the authors have emphasized how targeting errors may impact upon manual care of the spine. Practitioners in other fields that need to accurately locate spinal levels, such as acupuncture and anesthesiology, would also be expected to draw important conclusions from these findings. © 2014 Cooperstein and Young; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN: Clinical measurement.
OBJECTIVE: To establish trial-to-trial within-day and between-day reliability, standard error of measurement, and minimal detectable change of scapular orientation during elevation and lowering of the arm, and with the arm relaxed at the side, in individuals with and without shoulder impingement.
BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic devices are commonly used to measure 3-D scapular kinematics during arm elevation in different conditions and for intervention studies. However, there is a lack of studies that evaluate within- and between-day reliability of these measurements.
METHODS: The subjects were allocated to either a control group or an impingement group. Kinematic data were collected using the Flock of Birds electromagnetic device during elevation and lowering of the arm in the sagittal plane on 2 different occasions, separated by 3 to 5 days. Forty-nine subjects were tested for within-day reliability. Forty-three subjects were reassessed for between-day reliability.
RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients for within- and between-day assessment of scapular orientation during elevation and lowering of the arm in both groups ranged from 0.92 to 0.99 and from 0.54 to 0.88, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients for assessment of scapular orientation with the arms relaxed at the side in both groups ranged from 0.66 to 0.95. The standard error of measurement for between-day measurements ranged from 3.37° to 7.44° for both groups. The minimal detectable change for between-day measurements increased from 7.81° at the lower to 17.27° at the higher humerothoracic elevation angles.
CONCLUSION: These results support the use of Flock of Birds to measure scapular orientations in subjects with and without impingement symptoms. The measurements showed excellent within-day reliability but were not highly reliable over time.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if there were differences in scapular rotations (Type I and II) and position (Type III) between a group of subjects with scapular dyskinesis, diagnosed by the clinical observation of an expert physical therapist, using a group of healthy individuals (Type IV).
METHOD: Twenty-six asymptomatic subjects volunteered for this study. After a fatigue protocol for the periscapular muscles, the dynamic scapular dyskinesis tests were conducted to visually classify each scapula into one of the four categories (Type IV dyskinesis-free). The kinematic variables studied were the differences between the maximum rotational dysfunctions and the minimum value that represented both normal function and a small dysfunctional movement.
RESULTS: Only scapular anterior tilt was significantly greater in the type I dyskinesis group (clinical observation of the posterior projection of the inferior angle of the scapula) when compared to the scapular dyskinesis-free group (p=0.037 scapular and p=0.001 sagittal plane).
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical observation was considered appropriate only in the diagnoses of dyskinesis type I. Considering the lower prevalence and sample sizes for types II and III, further studies are necessary to validate the clinical observation as a tool to diagnose scapular dyskinesis.
BACKGROUND: Altered scapular rotation and position have been named scapular dyskinesis. Visual dynamic assessment could be applied to classify this alteration based on the clinical observation of the winging of the inferior medial scapular border (Type I) or of the prominence of the entire medial border (Type II), or by the excessive superior translation of the scapula (Type III).

N2  - Patient-specific biomechanical models including patient-specific finite-element (FE) models are considered potentially important tools for providing personalized healthcare to patients with musculoskeletal diseases. A multi-step procedure is often needed to generate a patient-specific FE model. As all involved steps are associated with certain levels of uncertainty, it is important to study how the uncertainties of individual components propagate to final simulation results. In this study, we considered a specific case of this problem where the uncertainties of the involved steps were known and the aim was to determine the uncertainty of the predicted strain distribution. The effects of uncertainties of three important components of patient-specific models, including bone density, musculoskeletal loads and the parameters of the material mapping relationship on the predicted strain distributions, were studied. It was found that the number of uncertain components and the level of their uncertainty determine the uncertainty of simulation results. The 'average' uncertainty values were found to be relatively small even for high levels of uncertainty in the components of the model. The 'maximum' uncertainty values were, however, quite high and occurred in the areas of the scapula that are of the greatest clinical relevance. In addition, the uncertainty of the simulation result was found to be dependent on the type of movement analysed, with abduction movements presenting consistently lower uncertainty values than flexion movements. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

N2  - The overhead athlete is at unique risk for injury because of the mechanics associated with rapid shoulder elevation, abduction, and external rotation. Angulation of the humeral head against the posterosuperior glenoid can cause rotator cuff tendon and labral impingement. The throwing or striking motion of baseball, softball, water polo, tennis, racquetball, and volleyball may result in scapular dyskinesis, partial articular-sided supraspinatus avulsions, and posterosuperior labral tears. The SICK scapula syndrome (scapular malposition, inferior medial border prominence, coracoid pain and malposition, and dyskinesis of scapular movement) is thought to increase the risk of injury in the overhead athlete. Special physical examination maneuvers and magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in diagnosing intra-articular pathology. Rehabilitation of injuries associated with internal impingement of the shoulder should include three basic components: strengthening, stretching, and sport-specific exercises. Arthroscopic surgery may be considered if symptoms do not improve after three months of conservative management. © 2014 American Academy of Family Physicians.

N2  - Quantitative motion analysis protocols have been developed to assess the coordination between scapula and humerus. However, the application of these protocols to test whether a subject's scapula resting position or pattern of coordination is "normal", is precluded by the unavailability of reference prediction intervals and bands, respectively. The aim of this study was to present such references for the "ISEO" protocol, by using the non-parametric Bootstrap approach and two parametric Gaussian methods (based on Student's T and Normal distributions).One hundred and eleven asymptomatic subjects were divided into three groups based on their age (18-30, 31-50, and 51-70). For each group, "monolateral" prediction bands and intervals were computed for the scapulo-humeral patterns and the scapula resting orientation, respectively. A fourth group included the 36 subjects (42±13 year-old) for whom the scapulo-humeral coordination was measured bilaterally, and "differential" prediction bands and intervals were computed, which describe right-to-left side differences.Bootstrap and Gaussian methods were compared using cross-validation analyses, by evaluating the coverage probability in comparison to a 90% target. Results showed a mean coverage for Bootstrap from 86% to 90%, compared to 67-70% for parametric bands and 87-88% for parametric intervals. Bootstrap prediction bands showed a distinctive change in amplitude and mean pattern related to age, with an increase toward scapula retraction, lateral rotation and posterior tilt.In conclusion, Bootstrap ensures an optimal coverage and should be preferred over parametric methods. Moreover, the stratification of "monolateral" prediction bands and intervals by age appears relevant for the correct classification of patients. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - In biomechanical modeling of the shoulder, it is important to know the orientation of each bone in the shoulder girdle when estimating the loads on each musculoskeletal element. However, because of the soft tissue overlying the bones, it is difficult to accurately derive the orientation of the clavicle and scapula using surface markers during dynamic movement. The purpose of this study is to develop two regression models which predict the orientation of the clavicle and the scapula. The first regression model uses humerus orientation and individual factors such as age, gender, and anthropometry data as the predictors. The second regression model includes only the humerus orientation as the predictor. Thirty-eight participants performed 118 static postures covering the volume of the right hand reach. The orientation of the thorax, clavicle, scapula and humerus were measured with a motion tracking system. Regression analysis was performed on the Euler angles decomposed from the orientation of each bone from 26 randomly selected participants. The regression models were then validated with the remaining 12 participants. The results indicate that for the first model, the r2 of the predicted orientation of the clavicle and the scapula ranged between 0.31 and 0.65, and the RMSE obtained from the validation dataset ranged from 6.92° to 10.39°. For the second model, the r2 ranged between 0.19 and 0.57, and the RMSE obtained from the validation dataset ranged from 6.62° and 11.13°. The derived regression-based shoulder rhythm could be useful in future biomechanical modeling of the shoulder. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - Multi-center clinical trials incorporating shoulder kinematics are currently uncommon. The absence of repeatability and limits of agreement (LoA) studies between different centers employing different motion analysis protocols has led to a lack dataset compatibility. Therefore, the aim of this work was to determine the repeatability and LoA between two shoulder kinematic protocols. The first one uses a scapula tracker (ST), the International Society of Biomechanics anatomical frames and an optoelectronic measurement system, and the second uses a spine tracker, the INAIL Shoulder and Elbow Outpatient protocol (ISEO) and an inertial and magnetic measurement system. First within-protocol repeatability for each approach was assessed on a group of 23 healthy subjects and compared with the literature. Then, the between-protocol agreement was evaluated. The within-protocol repeatability was similar for the ST ((Formula presented.)) and ISEO ((Formula presented.)) protocols and comparable with data from published literature. The between-protocol agreement analysis showed comparable scapula medio-lateral rotation measurements for up to 120° of flexion-extension and up to 100° of scapula plane ab-adduction. Scapula protraction-retraction measurements were in agreement for a smaller range of humeral elevation. The results of this study suggest comparable repeatability for the ST and ISEO protocols and between-protocol agreement for two scapula rotations. Different thresholds for repeatability and LoA may be adapted to suit different clinical hypotheses. © 2013 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.

N2  - Background: Brachial plexus birth palsy occurs in 0.4 to 4.6 of every 1000 live births, with residual shoulder dysfunction in approximately one third of cases. Clinical measures, such as the Mallet classification, provide no insight into the scapulothoracic and glenohumeral contributions to tested global shoulder movements. This study describes the scapulothoracic and glenohumeral components of shoulder motion during the modified Mallet test. Methods: Twelve children with Erb's palsy (C5-6) and 8 children with extended Erb's palsy (C5-7) were recruited. The unaffected limbs of 6 subjects were also tested. Locations of markers placed on the thorax, humerus, and scapula were recorded in a neutral position and each of the modified Mallet positions. Scapulothoracic, glenohumeral, and humerothoracic helical displacements and acromion process linear displacements were compared between groups. Results: The brachial plexus birth palsy groups exhibited significantly smaller glenohumeral displacements in all modified Mallet positions and significantly larger scapulothoracic displacements in the global external rotation and hand to mouth positions. Discriminant function analysis using only humerothoracic variables correctly classified 76.9% of subjects. Discriminant function analysis incorporating scapulothoracic, glenohumeral, and acromion process displacement variables produced accuracy of 92.6%. Conclusions: Children with brachial plexus birth palsy demonstrated decreased glenohumeral contributions to achieve every modified Mallet position and increased scapulothoracic contribution in two positions compared with the unaffected group. Different scapulothoracic and glenohumeral strategies were identified between groups. Finally, scapulothoracic and glenohumeral components of shoulder motion are more specific than humerothoracic measures to diagnostic classification. © 2014 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Background: Late complications after humeral head replacement (HHR) for comminuted proximal humeral fractures are common and may necessitate revision surgery. This study evaluated the outcome of revision surgery of failed post-traumatic HHR with a less medialized reverse shoulder prosthesis. Methods: Thirty-three patients with failed post-traumatic HHR due to rotator-cuff insufficiency and glenoid erosion, but with sufficient preservation of the glenoid bone stock to permit primary stability of an inverted glenoid implant, underwent revision using the Bayley-Walker reverse shoulder prosthesis (Stanmore Implants, Elstree, UK) and were monitored up for a mean of 31 months. Outcome measures included the Oxford Shoulder Score, subjective shoulder value, pain rating, active range of motion, and shoulder radiographs. Results: The average postrevision Oxford Shoulder Score and subjective shoulder value improved from 50 ± 6 to 29 ± 11 and from 23 ± 19 to 51 ± 23, respectively (P < .001). Pain level decreased from 6.2 ± 2.1 to 1.4 ± 2.0 (P < .001). Active forward flexion increased from 34° ± 22° to 63° ± 30° and external rotation from 11° ± 14° to 20° ± 16°(P < .01). More patients were able to use their affected arm to reach a functional triangle consisting the mouth, opposite armpit, and ipsilateral buttock after revision (24% vs 73%; P < .001). Seven patients (21%) had postrevision complications. No glenoid loosening or scapular notching occurred. Conclusion: Revision of failed post-traumatic HHR with the Bayley-Walker shoulder offers reliable pain relief and improvement in shoulder function with a complication rate similar to other reverse prostheses. Nevertheless, revision shoulder arthroplasty remains challenging with a high rate of complications. © 2014 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - A preclinical analysis of novel implants used in shoulder surgery requires biomechanical testing conditions close to physiology. Existing shoulder experiments may only partially apply multiple cycles to simulate postoperative, repetitive loading tasks. The aim of the present study was therefore the development of an experimental shoulder simulator with rotating scapula able to perform multiple humeral movement cycles by simulating individual muscles attached to the rotator cuff. A free-hanging, metallic humerus pivoted in a polyethylene glenoid is activated by tension forces of linear electroactuators to simulate muscles of the deltoideus (DELT), supraspinatus (SSP), infraspinatus/teres minor and subscapularis. The abductors DELT and SSP apply forces with a ratio of 3:1 up to an abduction angle of 85°. The rotating scapular part driven by a rotative electro actuator provides one-third to the overall arm abduction. Resulting joint forces and moments are measured by a 6-axis load cell. A linear increase in the DELT and SSP motors is shown up to a maximum of 150 and 50 N for the DELT and SSP, respectively. The force vector in the glenoid resulted in 253 N at the maximum abduction. The present investigation shows the contribution of individual muscle forces attached to the moving humerus to perform active abduction in order to reproducibly test shoulder implants. © 2013 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.

N2  - Objective: To compare different reliability coefficients (exact agreement, and variations of the kappa (generalised, Cohen's and Prevalence Adjusted and Biased Adjusted (PABAK))) for four physiotherapists conducting visual assessments of scapulae. Design: Inter-therapist reliability study. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: 30 individuals with no history of neck or shoulder pain were recruited with no obvious significant postural abnormalities. Main outcome measures: Ratings of scapular posture were recorded in multiple biomechanical planes under four test conditions (at rest, and while under three isometric conditions) by four physiotherapists. Results: The magnitude of discrepancy between the two therapist pairs was 0.04 to 0.76 for Cohen's kappa, and 0.00 to 0.86 for PABAK. In comparison, the generalised kappa provided a score between the two paired kappa coefficients. The difference between mean generalised kappa coefficients and mean Cohen's kappa (0.02) and between mean generalised kappa and PABAK (0.02) were negligible, but the magnitude of difference between the generalised kappa and paired kappa within each plane and condition was substantial; 0.02 to 0.57 for Cohen's kappa and 0.02 to 0.63 for PABAK, respectively. Conclusions: Calculating coefficients for therapist pairs alone may result in inconsistent findings. In contrast, the generalised kappa provided a coefficient close to the mean of the paired kappa coefficients. These findings support an assertion that generalised kappa may lead to a better representation of reliability between three or more raters and that reliability studies only calculating agreement between two raters should be interpreted with caution. However, generalised kappa may mask more extreme cases of agreement (or disagreement) that paired comparisons may reveal. © 2013 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.

N2  - Scapular dyskinesis is recognized as an abnormality in the kinetic chain; yet, there has been little research quantifying scapular motion during sport tasks. Tennis forehand drives of eight highly skilled tennis players were studied to assess the scapulothoracic kinematics and evaluate repeatability using video-based motion analysis. Scapulothoracic downward/upward rotation, posterior/anterior tilt, and internal/external rotation were computed using an acromial marker cluster. On average, the upward rotation, anterior tilt, and internal rotation varied from 1° to 26°, from 7° to 32°, and from 42° to 100°, respectively, during the tennis forehand drive. During the backswing and forward swing phases of the forehand stroke, small changes were observed for the three scapular angle values, while all angles increased rapidly during the follow-through phase. This suggests that the tennis forehand drive may contribute to scapula dyskinesis, mainly due to the great amplitude in scapulothoracic anterior tilt and internal rotation observed during the follow-through phase. Knowledge of normal scapula motion during sport tasks performed at high velocity could improve the understanding of various sport-specific adaptations and pathologies. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Push-up is a popular exercise for upper limb and shoulder complex strengthening. However, the movement must be performed in such a kinematic patter to way to avoid excessive internal loads. This paper aims at measuring elbow flexion and estimate inner angles at the shoulder, which are associated to joints sterno-clavicular (SC), the acromium-clavicular (AC) and the gleno-humeral (GH). The inverse kinematics modeling, necessary to reconstruct the joint angles from reflective markers positions was derived using the Joint Coordinate System (JCS) approach, proposed by Grood and Suntay. The angles obtained by this analysis can be directly associated with one segment movement plane. In the case of push-up exercise, some reflective markers in the anterior part of the body cannot be captured by the cameras. To overcome this problem, Marker-Surface Clusters were used. The accuracy of reconstruction related to the anatomical markers trajectory reconstruction was assessed by correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots between the reconstructed and measured markers, placed on anatomical landmarks. A movement that mimics push up, but with body upright, was used. This analysis revealed a very good agreement between the two measure methods, with average above 95%. The obtained kinematical patterns for real push-up with Marker-Surface Clusters are very symmetrical between left and right sides and physiologically plausible.

N2  - Several studies have described using an acromion marker cluster for measuring scapular orientation in healthy adults performing planar motions. It is unknown whether the acromion marker cluster method will provide the same level of accuracy in children with brachial plexus birth palsy. This study compared this method to palpation for calculating scapular orientation in children with brachial plexus birth palsy performing clinically relevant movements. Scapular orientation in ten patients was determined by palpation and an acromion marker cluster in neutral and six Modified Mallet positions. RMSEs and mean relative errors were calculated. Resultant RMSEs ranged from 5.2 degrees to 21.4 degrees. The averages of the mean relative errors across all positions for each axis were 177.4% for upward/downward rotation, 865.0% for internal/external rotation, and 166.2% for anterior/posterior tilt. The acromion marker cluster method did not accurately measure scapular rotation relative to the total movement on an individual or group basis in the population. With most relative errors over 100%, the acromion marker cluster method often produced errors larger than the actual measured motion. The accuracy of the acromion marker cluster method limits its use as a clinical tool for measuring scapular kinematics on children with brachial plexus birth palsy. © 2014 Human Kinetics, Inc.

N2  - To investigate the current practice of physiotherapists and occupational therapists in prescribing upper limb exercises to people after stroke and to explore differences between professions and work settings. A cross-sectional survey design. Occupational therapists and physiotherapists working in UK stroke rehabilitation. The survey's response rate was 21.0% (n = 322); with 295 valid responses. Almost two thirds of therapists (64.7%, n = 191) agreed that they always prescribe upper limb exercises to a person with stroke if they can actively elevate their scapula and have grade 1 finger/wrist extension. Most therapists (98.6%, n = 278) prescribed exercises to be completed outside of therapy time, with exercises verbally communicated to family. Standardised upper limb specific outcome measures were used to evaluate the prescribed exercises by 21.9% (n = 62) OF THERAPISTS. DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN PROFESSIONS AND ACROSS WORK SETTINGS. The majority of prescribed upper limb exercises were of low intensity (range of motion or stretching exercises) rather than repetitive practice or strengthening exercises. The use of standardised outcome measures was low. Progression of exercises and the provision of written instructions on discharge occur less frequently in inpatient settings than outpatient and community settings.

N2  - Background: The technique and results of shoulder arthroplasty are influenced by glenohumeral pathoanatomy. Although some authors advocate a routine preoperative CT scan to define this anatomy, ordering a CT scan substantially increases the cost and the radiation exposure for the patient. Questions/purposes: We asked whether measurements of arthritic shoulders on a standardized axillary view are reliable; if postoperative radiographs can reliably show the changes in glenoid anatomy and glenohumeral relationships after shoulder arthroplasty, and if the axillary view can show differences in glenohumeral pathoanatomy in the different sexes and disease types. Methods: These questions were addressed using cross-sectional studies of 344 shoulders with different types of arthritis and of 128 osteoarthritic shoulders having a ream and run arthroplasty (a glenohumeral arthroplasty that combines a noncemented humeral hemiarthroplasty with concentric reaming of the glenoid bone without implantation of a prosthetic glenoid component). Measurements of glenoid type, glenoid version, and glenohumeral contact were made on standardized axillary radiographs. Interobserver reliability was calculated, preoperative and postoperative measurements were compared, and morphologic differences were compared as stratified by sex and disease type. Results: The measurements on axillary views showed a high degree of interobserver reliability and sensitivity to the changes effected by arthroplasty. The ream and run substantially corrected the glenoid type and point of glenohumeral contact. Male shoulders and shoulders with osteoarthritis had more type B glenoids (ie, those with posterior erosion and biconcavity of the glenoid), more retroversion, and a greater degree of posterior displacement of the point of glenohumeral contact. Conclusions: The axillary view provides a practical method of characterizing glenohumeral anatomy before and after surgery that is less costly and exposes the patient to less radiation than a CT scan. Level of Evidence: Level IV, diagnostic study. See the Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence. © The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons® 2013.

N2  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasonography (US) and MRI findings in hemiplegic patients with shoulder pain and investigate the correlation between them. It is not possible for these patients to fully perform active range of motion (ROM) and stress tests, so imaging methods take center stage in diagnosis and treatment planning. A total of 68 hemiplegic patients with shoulder pain attending the inpatient rehabilitation program were included in the study. MRI and US results from the patient files were recorded. The frequency of each pathology identified by US and MRI was determined. The distribution of MRI and US findings was investigated to see whether there was a statistical difference between the correlation of MRI and US results. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 63.7 (8.3) years and the mean (SD) duration of hemiplegia was 49 (8.9) days. According to the MRI results, glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint degeneration was found in 77.9% and 79.7% of the patients, respectively; subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis in 80.9%; fluid increase in the joint space in 41.2%; supraspinatus tendinitis in 36.8%; and supraspinatus partial rupture in 33.8%. Shoulder US findings were supraspinatus tendinitis in 54.4%, acromioclavicular joint degeneration in 26.5%, bicipital tendinitis in 20.6%, and subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis in 19.1%. There was a statistically significant difference between MRI and US findings. The results were not compatible with each other (P ≯ .05), and these findings were not consistent with each other since the kappa coefficient was under 0.40 for all these results. Although US is recommended as the first method in determining shoulder pathologies in hemiplegic patients, we suggest that MRI should be used as the first choice in hemiplegic patients with shoulder pain. MRI and US findings were not consistent, and US is dependent on the experience of the operator. MRI should be the first choice in cases where the diagnosis will affect the treatment choice due to the lack of correlation between US and MRI findings.

N2  - Introduction: This modified reduction technique reduces trauma and morbidity for anterior and inferior dislocations, is easy to perform, and is reliable. Method: The procedure uses a "three directional pull" as follows: (1) Linear traction of the affected arm as it lies in the "position on arrival" in the Emergency Room. (2) Counter traction in the opposite direction. (3) The "third force" (a modification) is a sustained, increasing traction with a 2-3 in. broad sling placed around the neck of the humerus, pulling in the direction of 2 o'clock (left shoulder)/10 o'clock (right shoulder) in line with the lateral border of the scapula [runs parallel to the face of the glenoid]. Reduction is generally done under sedation, but general anesthesia used on the elderly and osteoporotics makes the procedure easier, safer, and quicker. Immobilization is in "internal rotation" for 3 weeks. Result: Reduction is either "spontaneous" or achieved in a maximum of three precisely graded attempts undertaken in quick succession in full "three directional traction mode," using a much reduced range of abduction and external rotation than that used in Kocher's technique. Conclusion: The "third force" is the crucial GUIDING force which helps to unbutton the head of the humerus from the rent in the capsule and/or "glide" the head effectively on to the glenoid. It will counteract or minimize muscle spasm. There was 100 % success in the 30 cases reduced by this technique over a period of 2.5 years. © 2013 EFORT.

N2  - Objective. The reliability of lateral scapular slide test (LSST) at 90 degrees of abduction is controversial; therefore, in order to achieve more reliability it may be necessary to make changes in this particular position. Methods. Modified lateral scapular slide test (MLSST) was done on thirty male basketball players with two examiners in one session and for the retest with one examiner in the next week. The test was done in 7 positions: arm relaxed at the side (P1), 90 degrees of abduction (P2), 90 degrees of scaption without having a weight in hands (P3), 90 degrees of scaption with having 3 different weights (1, 2, and 4 kg) in hands (P4, P5, and P6, resp.), and 180 degrees of scaption without having a weight in hands (P7). Results. In P1 and P6, the ICC scores indicated the highest level of intrarater reliability. In P2, the ICC scores showed a fair level of intrarater reliability, as the minimum reliability. The maximum and minimum interrater reliability were P1 and P4, respectively. Conclusion. Scaption with loading, as a functional position in the overhead athletes, is a reliable positioning and may be replaced with the third position of the traditional LSST. © 2014 Azadeh Shadmehr et al.

N2  - Introduction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the compatibility of external measurements of parameters characterizing scoliosis using the photogrammetric method. Material. The study involved 120 children between the ages of 7 and 11 years in Podkarpackie (Poland). Method. Measurements of body posture characteristics were performed using the photogrammetric method with mora projection. Each person was examined twice, once by two different therapists, with a time lapse of 20 minutes in between examinations. Results. High accuracy and no statistical significance were found among different measurements of asymmetry parameters characterizing the shoulder blades and hips. Regularities were also found in the characteristic measurements of curves of scoliosis. The POSTI parameter showed a significant variation and lack of compatibility of results. Conclusions. (1) The photogrammetric method used to assess the pathological changes caused by scoliosis gives significant results in terms of parameters characterizing the position of the shoulder blades and shoulders, as well as pelvis rotation. (2) High compliance measurements are also characterized by the length of the right and left arcs of scoliosis. © 2014 Justyna Drzał-Grabiec et al.

N2  - Finite element analyses, with increasing levels of detail and complexity, are becoming effective tools to evaluate the performance of joint replacement prostheses and to predict the behaviour of bone. As a first step towards the study of the complications of shoulder arthroplasty, the aim of this work was the development and validation of a 3D finite element model of an intact scapula for the prediction of the bone remodelling process based on a previously published model that attempts to follow Wolff's law. The boundary conditions applied include full muscle and joint loads taken from a multibody system of the upper limb based on the same subject whose scapula was here analysed. To validate the bone remodelling simulations, qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the predicted and the specimen's bone density distribution were performed. The results showed that the bone remodelling model was able to successfully reproduce the actual bone density distribution of the analysed scapula. © 2014 © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Introduction: The study of posture is not an easy task, mainly because postural assessment is still scientifically inaccurate. Photographs of bipedalism in the frontal and sagittal planes are one of the most widely used methods for this assessment. The aim of this literature review was to determine which anatomical markers authors of scientific papers have taken to minimize the chances of error in measurements. Materials and methods: The Medline and Lilacs databases were searched for the period from 2002 to 2012, with the following keywords: "postura"; "posture" and "postural.". Discussion: A number of studies have shown a reasonable correlation between radiographic measurements and the placement of markers. It appears possible to use photography as a form of scientific assessment since the anatomical landmarks are well chosen. Conclusion: The markers that were suggested in this review: malleolus; posterior calcaneal tuberosity; fibular head; tibial tuberosity; greater trochanter of the femur; anterior angle and/or posterior lateral edge of the acromion; spinous processes (particularly C7); inferior angle of the scapula; sternum manubrium; mental protuberance; and the intertragic notch. Iliac spines, both anterior superior and posterior superior, should only be used with lean subjects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To determine the ability of 2 clinicians to reliably measure the thickness of the serratus anterior (SA) muscle using ultrasound during scapular protraction and to determine whether that thickness changes during activation of the SA. Design: A cross-sectional observational study. Setting: An outpatient biomechanical laboratory. Participants: Twenty healthy, asymptomatic adults between the ages of 23 and 28 years. Methods: Ultrasound imaging measurements were recorded during 3 conditions: (1) with the subject in a side-lying position and resting in a supported position of 90° of shoulder flexion; (2) with the subject in a side-lying position and the shoulder in 90° of shoulder flexion and actively protracting; and (3) with the subject in a side-lying position and the shoulder in 90° of shoulder flexion while holding the protracted position against 15 lb of force. Main Outcome Measurements: Reproducibility was examined with use of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standard error of measurements. The thickness of the SA muscle measured during each condition was compared. Results: Intratester and intertester ICC values were high. Ranges for ICCs were 0.892-0.979 for intratester reliability within a session, 0.900-0.912 for intratester reliability between sessions, and 0.929-0.939 for intertester reliability. Statistically significant differences in the thickness of the SA were found between the rest condition and the hold with resistance condition but not between the rest condition and the active hold condition. Conclusion: Findings of this study document the high reliability of ultrasound imaging in determining SA muscle thickness and thickness changes at rest and during contraction of the SA. Clinicians should be aware that resistance may need to be added to active scapular protraction in a side-lying position to produce a significant change in SA thickness from the rest position. This information can be used by clinicians who assess the SA and treat scapular dysfunction when activation or facilitation of the SA is required. © 2014 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

N2  - Background: Three-dimensional (3D) wing computed tomography (CT) showed a high inter-rater reliability in assessing scapular dyskinesis. Methods: The 330 scapular movements of 165 patients were classified into 4 types by 7 blinded observers. Then, 3D wing CT was performed with patients prone, and 4 blinded observers measured 5 angles, consisting of upward rotation (UR) superior translation (ST), anterior tilting (AT), protraction (PRO), and internal rotation (IR). The inter-rater reliability (IRR) of 2 methods was calculated, and cutoff values were determined for the 5 angles on the 3D wing CT images. Results: The IRR was 0.783 for the observational method of scapular dyskinesis and 0.981 for 3D wing CT in the prone position. UR and ST angles were significantly larger in type 3 more than in the other types (P < .001, P < .001), and the AT angle showed a similar pattern in type 1 (P < .001). The PRO angle was significantly larger in types 1, 2, and 3 more than in type 4 (P < .001, P < .001, P = .013), and the IR angle was significantly larger in type 2 more than in the other types (P < .001). The cutoff values of the 5 angles were UR, 117 ST, 90AT, 8PRO, 99 and IR, 51. The UR angle showed a significant correlation with glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (odds ratio, 0.436; P = .029) and the IR angle with MDI (odds ratio, 8.947; P = .048). Conclusion: The patients with a high UR angle showed a low rate of glenohumeral internal rotation deficit and those with a high IR angle had a high rate of the MDI in affected shoulder by the determinant of the cutoff value of the 5 angles. © 2014 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Purpose: Extensive glenoid bone loss after failed shoulder arthroplasty represents a challenge for revision arthroplasty. Treatment options vary widely and have been a source of controversy among experts. Methods: Between 2004 and 2010, a total of 17 patients underwent glenoid reconstruction surgery using an autologous iliac crest bone graft and secondary revision arthroplasty due to extensive glenoid bone loss after failed previous total shoulder arthroplasty. The outcomes were assessed by means of clinical examination, Constant score, and bi-plane radiography as well as pre-, postoperative and follow-up CT. Results: Before the revision surgery, the mean Constant score was 24 ± 17 and improved to 40 ± 13 after the glenoid rebuilding and revision arthroplasty. CT imaging revealed adequate glenoid bone stock restoration with no relevant graft resorption or loosening of the glenoid. The average postoperative antero-posterior diameter of the glenoid was 28 ± 3 mm which had decreased to 25 ± 3 mm at follow-up. The average postoperative version of the glenoid was 95.7° ± 6° and had decreased to 98.5° ± 4° at follow-up. Both the glenoid version and diameter had changed significantly (P < 0.001) comparing postoperative and follow-up CT-scans. Conclusion: Glenoid reconstruction surgery using an iliac crest bone-block autograft prior to revision arthroplasty represents a valuable salvage procedure in cases of extensive glenoid bone loss after primary shoulder arthroplasty. Sufficient glenoid bone stock restoration is indispensable for reliable fixation of glenoid components and in turn a satisfactory clinical outcome. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - The function of the infraspinatus muscle, critical to rotator cuff function, is dependent upon the muscle's structure and innervation pattern. The morphology of the infraspinatus muscle has been inconsistently described in the literature. Additionally, the branching pattern of the suprascapular nerve in the infraspinous fossa has not been addressed in the literature. The purposes of this study were to determine: the arrangement of the infraspinatus muscle bellies the branching patterns of the suprascapular nerve to the infraspinatus muscle; if the infraspinatus muscle was composed the neuromuscular compartments. Forty-eight infraspinatus muscles from 24 embalmed cadavers were studied using standard dissection techniques to determine morphological characteristics and innervation patterns. Results demonstrated that the infraspinatus muscles were comprised of three separate muscular partitions with each partition residing in a thin fascial compartment but all residing deep to the posterior scapular fascia. A first order suprascapular nerve branch was present in 91.6% of superior, 100% of middle, and 70.8% of inferior partitions. A first order nerve was present in all 3 muscular compartments of the same infraspinatus muscle in 62.5% of cases. Second order nerve branches were present in 8.3% of superior, 0% of middle, and 29.2% of inferior partitions. These findings help to determine a more complete and accurate understanding of the structure of the infraspinatus muscle. A better understanding of its structure could lead to a better understanding of the function of the muscle. Such information will enable more effective rehabilitation strategies for injuries involving the infraspinatus component of the rotator cuff. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background: Open surgery to correct shoulder instability is deemed to facilitate recovery of static and dynamic motor functions. Postoperative assessments focus primarily on static outcomes (e.g., repositioning accuracy). We introduce kinematic measures of arm smoothness to assess shoulder patients after open surgery and compare them with nonoperated patients. Performance among both groups of patients was hypothesized to differ. Postsurgery patients were expected to match healthy controls. Methods: All participants performed pointing movements with the affected/dominant arm fully extended at fast, preferred, and slow speeds (36 trials per subject). Kinematic data were collected (100Hz, 3seconds), and mixed-design analyses of variance (group, speed) were performed with movement time, movement amplitude, acceleration time, and model-observed similarities as dependent variables. Nonparametric tests were performed for number of velocity peaks. Results: Nonoperated and postsurgery patients showed similarities at preferred and faster movement speeds but not at slower speed. Postsurgery patients were closer to maximally smoothed motion and differed from healthy controls mainly during slow arm movements (closer to maximal smoothness, larger movement amplitude, shorter movement time, and lower number of peaks; i.e., less movement fragmentation). Conclusions: Arm kinematic analyses suggest that open surgery stabilizes the shoulder but does not necessarily restore normal movement quality. Patients with recurrent anterior shoulder instability (RASI) seem to implement a "safe" but nonadaptive mode of action whereby preplanned stereotypical movements may be executed without depending on feedback. Rehabilitation of RASI patients should focus on restoring feedback-based movement control. Clinical assessment of RASI patients should include higher order kinematic descriptors. © 2014 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Introduction: Endoscopic clavicular resection is a common procedure, but few studies have analyzed predictive factors for outcome. Hypotheses: 1) Computed tomography (CT) of clavicular resection is reproductible; 2) Functional outcome correlates with resection length; 3) Other factors also influence outcome. Material and methods: Patients operated on between 2005 and 2010 were called back to establish functional scores (Constant, Simple Shoulder Test [SST], satisfaction) and undergo low-dose bilateral comparative computed tomography (CT) centered on the acromioclavicular joints. The assessment criteria were resection edge parallelism and resection length, measured using OsiriX® software. Radiological and clinical data were correlated. Results: 18 out of 21 patients (85%: 3 female, 15 male) were assessed. Mean age at surgery was 49 years (range, 40-62 yrs); mean follow-up was 4.2 years (1.6-7.2 yrs). Mean Constant score rose from 57.7 (25-85) to 70.2 (30-96); mean postoperative SST was 9.3 (3-12). 11 patients had very good and 4 poor results. CT resection length was reproducible, with intraclass, intra- and interobserver correlation coefficients >95%. There was no significant correlation between articular resection length on CT and functional scores (. P=. 0.2). Functional scores were negatively influenced by an occupational pathologic context (. P<. 0.01) and by associated tendinopathy. Discussion and conclusion: Low-dose CT enabled reproducible analysis of clavicular resection. The hypothesized correlation between resection length and functional result was not confirmed. Work accidents and occupational disease emerged as risk factors. Level of evidence: Single-center retrospective analytic cohort study. Level 4, guideline grade C. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional outcomes of arthroscopic Bankart repair for recurrent shoulder instability in the setting of moderate glenoid bone defect ranging from 20% to 30% in patients with moderate to low functional demand. Methods This study included 36 patients with unilateral recurrent instability and glenoid bone defects of 20% to 30% treated with arthroscopic stabilization. Glenoid bone loss was estimated on the en-face view of preoperative 3-dimensional computed tomography. Joint laxity was assessed clinically by use of the Beighton and Horan criteria, and patients were divided into 2 groups based on the presence of excessive joint laxity, group L (n = 13), or absence of excessive joint laxity, group N (n = 23). Functional assessments were performed with the patient-reported activity level; subjective shoulder value; Rowe score; and University of California, Los Angeles shoulder score. Results The mean glenoid defect size was 25.1% (range, 20% to 29%), and the overall functional outcomes improved significantly after surgery. A return to greater than 90% of the premorbid activity level was reported by 72% of patients (26 of 36 patients), and patient satisfaction was 83% (30 of 36 patients). There was no significant difference in functional outcomes between groups L and N (subjective shoulder value, 85.0% for group L v 88.9% for group N, P =.397; Rowe score, 83.5 for group L v 92.8 for group N, P =.537; and University of California, Los Angeles shoulder score, 32.2 for group L v 31.9 for group N, P =.697). Recurrent instability occurred in 4 patients (11%), 3 patients in group L (3 of 13, 23%) and 1 patient in group N (1 of 23, 4%), but this difference was not statistically significant (P =.125). Conclusions Arthroscopic stabilization for recurrent shoulder instability in patients with moderate to low functional demand produced satisfactory outcomes despite the presence of moderate glenoid bone defects of 20% to 30%. For patients with excessive joint laxity, however, arthroscopic stabilization may not be reliable, with a recurrence rate of 23%. © 2014 by the Arthroscopy Association of North America.

N2  - The first aim of this investigation was to quantify the distribution of trapezius muscle activity with different scapular postures while seated. The second aim of this investigation was to examine the association between changes in cervical and scapular posture when attempting to recruit different subdivisions of the trapezius muscle. Cervical posture, scapular posture, and trapezius muscle activity were recorded from 20 healthy participants during three directed shoulder postures. Planar angles formed by reflective markers placed on the acromion process, C7, and tragus were used to quantify cervical and scapular posture. Distribution of trapezius muscle activity was recorded using two high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) electrodes positioned over the upper, middle, and lower trapezius. Results validated the assumption that directed scapular postures preferentially activate different subdivisions of the trapezius muscle. In particular, scapular depression was associated with a more inferior location of trapezius muscle activity (. r=. 0.53). Scapular elevation was coupled with scapular abduction (. r=. 0.52). Scapular adduction was coupled with cervical extension (. r=. 0.35); all other changes in cervical posture were independent of changes in scapular posture. This investigation provides empirical support for reductions in static loading of the upper trapezius and improvements in neck posture through verbal cueing of scapular posture. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Objective: The critical shoulder angle (CSA) is an indicator of degenerative shoulder pathologies. CSAs above 35° are associated with degenerative rotator cuff disease, whereas values below 30° are common in osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint. Measurements are usually performed on radiographs; however, no data have been reported regarding the reliability of CT scan measurements between different readers or the reproducibility of measurements from radiographs to CT scans. The purpose of our study was to clarify whether CSA measurements on radiographs and CT scans of the same patients show similar values. Materials and methods: CSA measurements of 60 shoulders (59 patients) were performed on radiographs and multiplanar reconstructions of corresponding CT scans. Inter-reader reliability and inter-method correlation were calculated. Results: The mean discrepancy between readers was only 0.2° (SD ±1.0°) on radiographs. CT scan measurements showed a mean discrepancy of 0.3° (SD ±1.2°). The inter-reader reliability was 0.993 for radiographs and 0.989 for CT scans. There was a very strong inter-method correlation between the CSA measured on radiographs and CT scans (Spearman's rho∈=∈0.974). The mean differences between angles on radiographs and CT measurements were -0.05° (SD ±1.2°) and 0.1° (SD ±1.2°), respectively. Conclusion: Measurements of the CSA on anterior-posterior radiographs and CT scans are highly correlated, and inter-modality differences are negligible. © 2014 ISS.

N2  - Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical outcome, rate of recurrence, complications, and rate of postoperative osteoarthritis in patients with anterior shoulder instability managed with Latarjet, Bristow, or Eden-Hybinette procedures. Methods A systematic review of the literature on management of anterior dislocation of the shoulder with glenoid bony procedures was performed. A comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases using various combinations of the keywords "shoulder," "dislocation," "treatment," "Latarjet," "Bristow," "bone loss," "Eden-Hybinette," "iliac," "bone," "block," "clinical," "outcome," and "Bankart." The following data were extracted: demographics, bone defects and other lesions, type of surgery, outcome measurement, range of motion (ROM), recurrence of instability, complications, and osteoarthritis. A quantitative synthesis of all comparative studies was performed to compare bone block procedures and Bankart repair in terms of postoperative recurrence of instability and osteoarthritis. Results Forty-six studies were included and 3,211 shoulders were evaluated. The mean value of the Coleman Methodology Score (CMS) was 65 points. Preoperatively, the injuries detected most were glenoid bone loss and Bankart lesions. The Eden-Hybinette procedure had the highest rate of postoperative osteoarthritis and recurrence. Pooled results from comparative studies showed that the bone block procedures were associated with a lower rate of recurrence when compared with Bankart repair (odds ratio [OR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28 to 0.74; P =.002), whereas there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of postoperative osteoarthritis (P =.79). Conclusions The open Bristow-Latarjet procedure continues to be a valid surgical option to treat patients with anterior shoulder instability. Bone block procedures were associated with a lower rate of recurrence when compared with the Bankart repair. The Eden-Hybinette procedure has clinical outcomes very similar to the Bristow-Latarjet technique but has a higher rate of postoperative osteoarthritis and recurrence. An arthroscopic Bristow-Latarjet procedure seems to be better in terms of prevention of recurrence and rehabilitation, but randomized studies are needed to reach definitive conclusions. © 2014 by the Arthroscopy Association of North America.

N2  - Background: Notching of the scapular pillar is the main radiographic complication seen during follow-up of reverse shoulder arthroplasties. Several recommendations pertaining to the implantation technique and glenoid component design have been suggested. No studies have investigated potential anatomic risk factors for inferior scapular impingement. Hypothesis: A specific anatomic shape of the scapular pillar promotes the development of notching. Materials and methods: The Aequalis Reversed<sup>®</sup> (Tornier Inc., Edina, MN, USA) prosthesis was implanted into 40 cadaver scapulae. We measured maximal range-of-motion (ROM) in internal rotation, external rotation, and adduction. The anatomic specimens were then imaged using two-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and the scapular neck angle, surface area under the scapular pillar, and distance from the central glenosphere peg to the inferior glenoid rim were measured. Associations between these CT parameters and ROM values were assessed using statistical independence tests. Results: ROM values were greatest when the surface area under the scapular pillar was above 0.8cm<sup>2</sup> (P<0.5). This feature combined with a scapular neck angle less than 105° produced the largest ROM values (P<0.5). Discussion: The scapular neck angle alone is not sufficient to identify a scapular morphology that increases the risk of notching. The surface area under the scapular pillar, in contrast, discriminates between scapulae with and without a high risk of notching. The surface area under the scapular pillar is influenced by the inferior glenoid offset. Conclusion: We were unable to define a specific scapular shape at high risk for notching. The prevention of notching should rely chiefly on a rigorous glenoid component implantation technique, with particular attention to the inferior offset. Level of evidence: III, experimental study. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Objective: This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of clinical tests applied to patients with shoulder pain at a physical therapy outpatient clinic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were the major determinants to evaluate the accuracy of the clinical tests. Also, the relationship between the MRI findings and the pain and functional status of the shoulder were evaluated.
Results: The sensitivity of the tests evaluating impingement and rotator cuff pathologies was found to be high, but specificity was low. Diagnostic performance of the drop arm test to determine the supraspinatus ruptures; Yocum test to determine the subacromial and subdeltoid effusion; Patte test and external rotation lag sign to determine infraspinatus tendon pathologies; speed test to determine biceps pathologies; and horizontal adduction test and painful arc test to determine acromioclavicular joint pathologies were found to be statistically significant. In this study, the severity of pain and shoulder pathologies showed no statistically significant correlation. In terms of functional status, high scores were achieved only in the bicipital tendinitis group.
Conclusion: MRI findings show that patients with shoulder pain may have multiple pathological lesions. Despite the coexistence of multiple pathologies and low specificity of clinical tests, clinical tests evaluating shoulder pathologies have great importance in directing the clinicians to diagnose and plan treatments because of high sensitivity.
Material and Methods: Seventy-six patients, referred to a physical therapy outpatient clinic with shoulder pain, were included in the study. Physical examination of all patients and specific clinical tests were performed for different shoulder pathologies. Pain levels of patients were evaluated with the visual analog scale and functional status of the shoulder with the Shoulder Disability Questionnaire. All patients were evaluated with MRI. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the clinical tests were evaluated on the basis of the MRI findings.

N2  - The construct validity and construct responsiveness of the performance scale of the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was measured in 87 newly admitted patients with chronic pain attending an outpatient rehabilitation clinic. At admission and after 12 wk, patients completed a COPM interview, the Pain Disability Index (PDI), and the RAND 36-Item Health Survey (RAND-36). We determined the construct validity of the COPM by correlations between the COPM performance scale (COPM-P), the PDI, and the RAND-36 at admission. Construct responsiveness was assessed by calculating the correlations between the change scores (n = 57). The COPM-P did not significantly correlate with the PDI (r = 0.260) or with any subscale of the RAND-36 (r = 0.007 to 0.248). Only a moderate correlation was found between change scores of the COPM-P and PDI (r = 0.380) and weak to moderate correlations were found between change scores of the COPM-P and the RAND-36 (r = 0.031 to 0.388), with the higher correlations for the physical functioning, social functioning,  and  role  limitations (physical)  subscales.  In patients with chronic pain attending our rehabilitation program, the COPM-P measures something different than the RAND-36 or PDI. Therefore, construct validity of the COPM-P was not confirmed by our data. We were not able to find support for the COPM-P to detect changes in occupational performance.

N2  - Background Glenohumeral displacements assessment would help to design shoulder prostheses with physiological arthrokinematics and to establish more biofidelic musculoskeletal models. Though displacements were documented during static tasks, there is little information on their 3D coupling with glenohumeral angle during dynamic tasks. Our objective was to characterize the 3D glenohumeral displacement-rotation couplings during dynamic arm elevations and rotations.
Methods Glenohumeral displacements were measured from trajectories of reflective markers fitted on intracortical pins inserted into the scapula and humerus. Bone geometry was recorded using CT-scan. Only four participants were recruited to the experiment due to its invasiveness. Participants performed dynamic arm abduction, flexion and axial rotations. Linear regressions were performed between glenohumeral displacements and rotations. The pin of the scapula of one participant moved, his data were removed from analysis, and results are based on three participants.
Findings The measurement error of glenohumeral kinematics was less than 0.15 mm and 0.2°. Maximum glenohumeral displacements were measured along the longitudinal direction and reached up to + 12.4 mm for one participant. Significant couplings were reported especially between longitudinal displacement and rotation in abduction (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> up to 0.94).
Interpretation The proposed method provides the potential to investigate glenohumeral kinematics during all kinds of movements. A linear increase of upward displacement during dynamic arm elevation was measured, which contrasts with results based on a series of static poses. The systematic investigation of glenohumeral displacements under dynamic condition may help to provide relevant recommendation for the design of shoulder prosthetic components and musculoskeletal models.

N2  - To direct interventions aimed at improving scapular position and motion in shoulder pathologies, a clinically feasible, objective, sensitive and reliable assessment of scapular dyskinesis is needed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the intra- and inter-observer reliability and the precision of 3D scapula kinematics measurement using wireless sensors of an inertial and magnetic measurement system (IMMS). Scapular kinematics during humerus anteflexion and abduction of 20 subjects without shoulder pathologies were measured twice by two observers at two different days, using IMMS. Similar movement patterns and corresponding high intraclass correlation coefficients were found within (intra) and between (inter) observers, especially for scapular retraction/protraction (0.65–0.85) and medio/lateral rotation (0.56–0.91). Lowest reliability and highest difference in range of motion were observed for anterior/posterior tilt. Medio/lateral rotation and anterior/posterior tilt showed a high precision, with standard error of measurement being mostly below 5°. The inter-observer measurements of retraction/protraction showed lowest precision, reflected in systematic differences. This is caused by an offset in anatomical calibration of the sensors. IMMS enables easy and objective measurement of 3D scapula kinematics. Further research in a patient population should focus on clinical feasibility and validity for measurement of scapular dyskinesis. This would include the application of a scapula locator to enhance anatomical calibration.

N2  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability of using freehand three-dimensional ultrasound to measure scapular rotations (internal/external, upward/downward, anterior/posterior). The scapular position in 22 healthy, nondisabled individuals was imaged three times in four testing positions of interest (arm at rest and humeral elevation in the sagittal, frontal, and scapular planes). We found substantial reliability across scanning positions and scapular rotations, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.62 to 0.95. The highest reliability was found in the rest testing position. Our standard error of measurement was less than 2 degrees for all measurements and less than 0.5 degrees for most. Minimum detectable change ranged from 0.37 to 3.08 degrees. Our results agree with the pattern of movement found in other studies, with the scapula moving toward a more externally rotated, upwardly rotated, and posteriorly tilted position with humeral elevation. Further study is warranted to compare our methods to a gold standard, apply them to evaluation of dynamic movement, and determine whether they can be used to detect shoulder pathology.

N2  - The incidence of traumatic shoulder instability is 1.7% in the general population. The shoulder bone structure provides inherent instability to the joint. The surgeon must study the patient age, dominance and activity, as well as the number and direction of the dislocations, and finally the general conditions of the soft tissues. Initial radiographs include anteroposterior and axillary or Velpeau view, in case of bone injury an AP internal rotation and Stryker view or axillary view should be taken. Magnetic Resonance Imaging allows the study of associated soft tissue injuries. It has been described a number of surgical treatments for recurrent shoulder instability, nevertheless, arthroscopic Bankart repair is the most used. An anterior glenoid defect has been reported in 90% of cases with recurrent anterior shoulder instability. This kind of injuries might require other treatment methods such as transferring the coracoid process, which works by the so called triple lock concept. This surgery is also indicated in cases of glenoid bone defect and subscapularis rupture. The surgical technique has proved to be reproducible through the years and the rehabilitation process is rapid allowing an early return to sports. Complications are mostly secondary to technical mistakes. Recent studies report 96% of satisfaction with only 1% of patients requiring revision surgery. However, it is considered that there is insufficient evidence to consider Latarjet's technique a better technique, despite of better results reported when comparing subjective assessment of mobility, stability and so far by subjective functional tests. Evidence level: IV.

N2  - Objectives: Increased humeral retroversion in the throwing shoulder is considered to exist in many baseball players and is often considered as a cause of internal rotation deficit. However, retroversion angles using two-dimensional (2D) methods utilized in previous studies did not correlated with a true three-dimensional measurement technique (3D retroversion) in our study. The purposes of this study were to determine 1) if significant side-to-side differences in retroversion exist, and 2) the relationships between retroversion and glenohumeral range of motion (ROM) in baseball players with a shoulder disorder. Methods: Fourteen male baseball players (age: 21.4 ± 1.5 years; mean ± standard deviation) with a throwing shoulder disorder were enrolled, including 11 in the collegiate and 3 in the adult levels, comprising 5 pitchers and 9 position players. The mean age when the athletes had started playing baseball was 9.1 years (range, 6 to 10 years) and the mean playing experience was 12.1 years (range, 9 to 17 years). Patients with history of fracture or surgery in the shoulder or elbow were excluded. Outcome measurements included a 3D retroversion angle and glenohumeral ROM in bilateral shoulders. Patients underwent CT scan at 1.0 mm slice pitch for the bilateral humerus and geometric bone models were created. The 3D retroversion angle was defined as an angle between the projected humeral neck line (connecting the spherical center of the humeral head and the cylindrical axis of the humeral shaft) onto the horizontal plane and the flexion-extension axis of the distal humerus obtained by a cylinder-fitting method for the capitulum and trochlea (intratester reliability: ICC 0.98, standard error of measurement: 1.7º). The CT slices for the proximal and distal humerus were used to measure a 2D-CT retroversion angle using a reported convention. An indirect measurement of retroversion was performed using a bicipital grove-ulna angle by an ultrasound images dusing a reported convention. Glenohumeral ROM measurements included internal rotation (IR) and horizontal adduction (HAd) in the supine position with the scapula manually stabilized on the treatment table. Independent t tests were used to determine if significant side-to-side differences exist in retroversion and glenohumeral ROM. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to determine the association between retroversion and glenohumeral ROM in the throwing shoulders. Statistical analysis was performed with PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL). An alpha level of 0.05 was set a priori for statistical significance. Results: No significant difference was found in 3D retroversion between the throwing and non-throwing shoulders (P =.182). The throwing shoulders demonstrated decreased IR and HAd compared with the non-throwing shoulders (P<.001 and P =.002, respectively). There were no significant correlations between retroversion and glenohumeral ROM for the throwing shoulders (Table). The 2D-CT retroversion and bicipital grove-ulna angles were greater in the throwing shoulder (P =.007 and.009, respectively). Conclusion: Contradicted to the previous studies, no side-to-side difference in retroversion and no association between retroversion and glenohumeral ROM were observed in the baseball players with a shoulder disorder. We believe that deficit in shoulder IR and HAd may be attributed to soft tissue tightness. The results of the previous studies involving humeral retroversion should be reassessed.

N2  - Background: Deltoid splitting is one of common and useful approaches in proximal humerus surgery. The disadvantage of this approach is high risk of axillary nerve injury. Nowadays, there is no consensus in the proper mean of the individual's axillary nerve location. Objective: The present study aim to determine the correlation between the axillary nerve and the upper arm length that may create equations to calculate the nerve location. Material and Method: Seventy shoulders were measured the distance from lateral acromial edge to axillary nerve and compared with upper arm length in three positions of the shoulder (adduction 30 °, abduction 45 °and 90 °). The authors used distance of lateral acromial edge to lateral epicondyle and tip of greater tuberosity to lateral epicondyle as the upper arm length. Results: The average distance of shoulder adduction 30°, abduction 45° and 90° were 57.9, 57.1 and 52.9 mm, respectively. All of three positions showed linear correlation to upper arm length from both of reference sites. From acromion edge reference, where “Y” is axillary nerve distance in mm and “x” is upper arm length in cm, the relation were Y = 2.3x-10, Y = 2x-2 and Y = 2x-7 with the accuracy rate were 88.57%, 85.71% and 81.43%, respectively. From greater tuberosity reference, the relations were Y = 2.54x-14, Y = 2x and Y = 2.3x-12 with the accuracy rates 87.14%, 80% and 84.29%, respectively. Conclusion: There is linear correlation between distance from the lateral acromial edge to axillary nerve and the upper arm length. The authors can predict the danger zone in the location of the anterior upper branch of the axillary nerve. However, further clinical study may helpful to prove the equations. Level of evidence: Basic science anatomy study.

N2  - UNLABELLED: A total of 11 male and 19 female violinists performed 30-second random-ordered slow and fast musical repertoire while right shoulder three-dimensional kinematic, and upper trapezius and serratus anterior surface electromyography (EMG) data were summarised using exposure variation analysis (EVA), a bivariate distribution of work time spent at categories of signal amplitude, and duration spent at a fixed category of amplitude. Sixty-two per cent of intraclass correlation coefficients [1,1] for all kinematic and EMG variables exceeded 0.75, and 40% of standard error of the measurement results were below 5%, confirming EVA reliability. When fast repertoire was played, increases in odds ratios in short duration cells were seen in 23 of 24 possible instances, and decreases in longer duration cells were seen in 17 instances in all EVA arrays using multinomial logistic regression with random effects, confirming a shift towards shorter duration. A reliable technique to assess right shoulder kinematic and EMG exposure in violinists was identified.
PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: A reliable method of measuring right shoulder motion and muscle activity exposure variation in violinists was developed which can be used to assess ergonomic risk in other occupations. Recently developed statistical methods enabled differentiation between fast and slow musical performance of standardised musical repertoire.

N2  - Objective: Determine the normal value of shoulder muscle strengh, in an adult population divided in six groups between 20 to 86 years, without known shoulder pathology. Materials and Methods: 523 individuals, 1046 shoulders, had their muscle strengh evaluated in two different positions, in 90 abduction and 90º fowarf flexion in the scapular plane. Three measurements were performed and the aveage one was recorded. Patiens with known shoulder pathology, reumathoid diseases, cancer were excluded. The patients were divided in six groups according to age, from 20 to 29 (68 patients), 30 to 39 (92 patients), 40 to 49 (109 patients), 50 to 59 (103 patients), 60 to 69 (91 patients) and 70 to 90 (60 patients). The strengh eas measured in pounds. Results: Average mucle strengh was 17,64 at the scapular plane and 16,82 lb at 90ª (p<0,0001)For the right shoulder, the average muscle strengh of the second decade group was 22 lb at scapular plane and 20,73 at 90º. The third decade was 19,93 and 18,50 respectively. The fouth decade values were 20,45 and 19,58, on the fifth decade 17,83 and 17,07. On the sixth decade was 15,57 and 15,23 and for the seventh decade was 11,40 and 11 lb respectively. The values for the left shoulder were for the second decade 21,53 om the scapular plane and 20,53 at 90º. On the third decade were 19,33 and 18,17, on the fourth decade 19,62 and 18,95, on the fifth decade were 16,8 and 16,2, on the sixth decade 15,57 and 15,23. And for the final group 11,4 and 11 lb. Significant differences were seen between both shoulders,sex (p<0,0001), position of the arm at time of measure (p0,0001), dominace (p0,001) Conclusion: The objective measurement of the muscle strengh of the shoulder varies significantly with age, sex and position of the arm at time of measure, putting in dout the validity of the contralateral shoulder as a value to compare against.

N2  - Arthroscopic stabilization of the glenohumeral joint has become the treatment of choice for the management of anteroinferior instability of the glenohumeral joint. Arthroscopic treatment affords improved visualization of primary pathology and associated lesions, decreased scarring, improved postoperative motion, as well as decreased postoperative pain. The addition of knotless anchors to a surgeon's armory provides stable fixation of the pathologic labrocapsular complex to the glenoid rim without the technical difficulties associated with arthroscopic knot tying and may further avoid complications from the presence of intraarticular knots that may irritate the articular surface. The key to successful surgery remains the identification and treatment of all associated pathology. Accurate portal placement and careful anchor placement are keys to the anatomical restoration of the labrum. Simple as well as more complex suture configurations allow a surgeon to restore the labral height and position. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Glenoid bone loss may dictate the success of procedures to restore anterior shoulder instability. The Latarjet procedure addresses bony defects to minimize the risk of recurrence in this subset of patients with bone loss in both athletes and non-athletes alike. This article describes a modified, open Latarjet procedure using a subscapularis splitting technique that provides stability through the triple-blocking effect previously described by Patte et al. The "sling effect", a dynamic effect created by the transfer of the conjoint tendon, provides stabilization in abducted and externally rotated arm positions particularly at mid and end ranges of motion. Augmentation of the anteroinferior glenoid increases or restores the glenoid diameter to provide stability through a "bone blocking effect". Lastly, stability is achieved by repairing the capsule to the coracoacromial ligament stump. This open procedure has been utilized successfully when a physician is confronted by this difficult clinical scenario. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Management of proximal humerus fractures with hemiarthroplasty has been shown to yield unpredictable and inconsistent outcomes. Risk factors for clinical failure following hemiarthroplasty include postoperative tuberosity failure, advanced age, female sex, osteoporosis, and inability or unwillingness to participate in the extensive rehabilitation required. In this difficult-to-manage injury, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) for fracture has been shown to reliably restore elevation, even in cases of tuberosity failure, and to restore rotational movements if the tuberosity heals. In addition, a fracture-specific implant design has been suggested to improve the likelihood of tuberosity healing. Early results indicate that fractures of the proximal humerus that are indicated for arthroplasty should be considered for rTSA. Tuberosity integrity appears to impact rotational movement but not restoration of elevation.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to validate a reverse shoulder computer impingement model and quantify the impact of implant position on scapular impingement by comparing it to that of a radiographic analysis of 256 patients who received the same prosthesis and were followed postoperatively for an average of 22.2 months. Methods: A geometric computer analysis quantified anterior and posterior scapular impingement as the humerus was internally and externally rotated at varying levels of abduction and adduction relative to a fixed scapula at defined glenoid implant positions. These impingement results were compared to radiographic study of 256 patients who were analyzed for notching, glenoid baseplate position, and glenosphere overhang. Results: The computer model predicted no impingement at 0° humeral abduction in the scapular plane for the 38 mm, 42 mm, and 46 mm devices when the glenoid baseplate cage peg is positioned 18.6 mm, 20.4 mm, and 22.7 mm from the inferior glenoid rim (of the reamed glenoid) or when glenosphere overhang of 4.6 mm, 4.7 mm, and 4.5 mm was obtained with each size glenosphere, respectively. When compared to the radiographic analysis, the computer model correctly predicted impingement based upon glenoid baseplate position in 18 of 26 patients with scapular notching and based upon glenosphere overhang in 15 of 26 patients with scapular notching. Conclusions: Reverse shoulder implant positioning plays an important role in scapular notching. The results of this study demonstrate that the computer impingement model can effectively predict impingement based upon implant positioning in a majority of patients who developed scapular notching clinically. This computer analysis provides guidance to surgeons on implant positions that reduce scapular notching, a well-documented complication of reverse shoulder arthroplasty.

N2  - Purpose Of The Study: To present the TightRope (Arthrex, Naples, FL) technique and its results in the arthroscopic stabilisation of acute acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) dislocation carried out at our department. Material And Methods: From July 2009 till December 2010, arthroscopic stabilisation of acute ACJ dislocation was performed in 22 patients. The group consisted of 18 men and four women with an average age of 37.4 years. The Rockwood type III to type V ACJ dislocations (III, 16; IV, 1; V, 5) were indicated for surgery. The average interval between injury and surgery was 5.4 days. In all cases, a second-generation TightRope implant was inserted by the EndoButton technique joining the distal end of the clavicle and the coracoid process. The results were evaluated using the UCLA Shoulder Scale at 6 months after surgery. Results: All 22 patients returned to their pre-operative activities without any restriction of shoulder motion within 5 months of surgery. The average post-operative UCLA score was 31.2 points (range, 28 to 35). Radiographic evidence of the loss of full reduction, with no effect on the clinical outcome, was recorded in four patients (18%) during post-operative rehabilitation. Of these, one had Rockwood type III, two had type IV and one had type V dislocations. One patient suffered post-operative pull-out of the implant from the coracoid; three patients showed skin wound healing by second intention above the lateral clavicle, with one requiring surgical repair under local anaesthesia. There was no neurovascular complication, intra- or postoperative fracture of the coracoid process or lateral clavicle, or deep wound infection. Discussion: Arthroscopic stabilisation of acute ACJ dislocation is a minimally invasive procedure providing the coracoclavicular ligament complex with dynamic stability. In comparison with open procedures, it is less painful post-operatively, allows the patients to return early to daily activities and has a better cosmetic effect. It eliminates the necessity of removing the osteosynthetic material, as is the case in commonly used techniques such as Bosworth's method, K-wiring, osteorrhaphy or hook plate insertion. The loss of full reduction in four patients, as observed on radiographs during their rehabilitation, was not accompanied by any clinical problems and is in agreement with the findings of other authors. In our group, it occurred in Rockwood grade IV and grade V dislocations. For these, there is a possibility of using two implants in order to increase stability and prevent the loss of full reduction but this involves a higher risk of coracoid fracture, extension of operative time and higher costs. However, a loss of reduction in some patients has also been reported by the authors who have used two implants. Therefore we prefer using a single TightRope implant, particularly in acute grade III ACJ dislocations requiring surgical treatment in patients engaged in repetitive overhead activities related to sports or occupation. Conclusions: Arthroscopic stabilisation of acute ACJ dislocations using a single TightRope implant is an elegant minimally invasive method with good results in indicated cases. It proves efficient particularly in Rockwood type III injuries in patients who have to do repetitive overhead activities. Acute type IV and type V ACJ dislocations treated by this technique show a loss of full reduction on radiographs more frequently, although no effect on the clinical outcome is evident.

N2  - Electromagnetic devices allow the non invasive and accurate measurement of 3D scapula kinematics. The acromial method allows continuous dynamic measurement using a skin surface sensor fixed to the acromion. Inter-session intra and inter-observer repeatability of 3D scapular kinematics have only been partially assessed for analytical movements and never for functional tasks. Inter-session intra and inter-observer repeatability of 3D scapular kinematics were assessed for arm elevation in the sagittal and frontal planes and for two activities of daily living (ADL), hair combing and back washing, in both shoulders of 15 healthy subjects, using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the standard error of measurement (SEM), the small real difference (SRD) and the Bland and Altman's graphical method. Intra-observer repeatability was good to excellent for every scapular rotation for both arm elevation in isolated planes and ADL (ICC ranged from 0.64 to 0.95). Inter-observer repeatability of scapular rotations was fair to excellent for arm elevation in isolated planes (ICC ranged from 0.49 to 0.92) and poor to excellent for ADL (ICC ranged from 0.35 to 0.89). Inter-observer repeatability of scapular protraction/retraction had the lowest ICC. For both inter-session intra and inter-observer reliability, the SEM and SRD remained low and Bland and Altman's graphical method showed a good repeatability of the measurement method. Longitudinal monitoring of a subject's scapular kinematics by a trained observer is reliable. The inter-observer repeatability of scapular protraction/retraction must be improved. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Tendinopathy is a term used to describe a painful tendon disorder but despite being a well-recognised clinical presentation, a definitive understanding of the pathoaetiology of rotator cuff tendinopathy remains elusive. Current explanatory models, which relate to peripherally driven nocioceptive mechanisms secondary to structural abnormality, or failed healing, appear inadequate on their own in the context of current literature. In light of these limitations this paper presents an extension to current models that incorporates the integral role of the central nervous system in the pain experience. The role of the central nervous system (CNS) is described and justified along with a potential rationale to explain the favourable response to loaded therapeutic exercises demonstrated by previous studies. This additional consideration has the potential to offer a useful way to explain pain to patients, for clinicians to prescribe appropriate therapeutic management strategies and for researchers to advance knowledge in relation to this clinically challenging problem. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The purposes of this study were to establish the reliability for measuring scapular muscle thickness, and to examine how scapular muscle thickness changes with respect to external loads. Participants were asymptomatic subjects recruited from a sample of convenience. Thickness Measures were taken using rehabilitative ultrasound imaging (RUSI) under 11 conditions, rest and 10 progressive loads, for the Lower Trapezius (LT) and Serratus Anterior (SA). The procedures were repeated 1 week later to determine reliability. Bland and Altman limits of agreement and Interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to determine reliability. Separate repeated measure ANOVAs were performed to determine differences in muscle thickness for both muscles across 3 conditions; rest and the 2 loaded conditions that represented the lowest and highest torque values. Results demonstrate good within and between day reliability for the LT (ICC =86 to 99) and SA (ICC =88 to 99). For the LT and SA, there were significant differences between the resting thickness and 2 lifting conditions (p ≤ .01) but not between the two lifting conditions. It was concluded that RUSI is reliable in measuring scapular muscle thickness. RUSI is sensitive enough to detect absolute changes in thickness from resting to a contracted state but unable to detect differences between loads imposed on the shoulder. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The shoulder has the greatest range of motion of any joint in the human body. This is due, in part, to the complex interplay between the glenohumeral (GH) joint and the scapulothoracic (ST) articulation. Currently, our ability to study shoulder kinematics is limited, because existing models isolate the GH joint and rely on manual manipulation to create motion, and have low reproducibility. Similarly, most established techniques track shoulder motion discontinuously with limited accuracy. To overcome these problems, we have designed a novel system in which the shoulder girdle is studied intact, incorporating both GH and ST motions. In this system, highly reproducible trajectories are created using a robotic actuator to control the intact shoulder girdle. High-speed cameras are employed to track retroreflective bone markers continuously. We evaluated this automated system's capacity to reproducibly capture GH translation in intact and pathologic shoulder conditions. A pair of shoulders (left and right) were tested during forward elevation at baseline, with a winged scapula, and after creation of a full thickness supraspinatus tear. The system detected differences in GH translations as small as 0.5 mm between different conditions. For each, three consecutive trials were performed and demonstrated high reproducibility and high precision.

N2  - Introduction Following an increase in the incidence of scapular fractures and interest in the outcome of their treatment, a basic classification system was developed for ease of use in the emergency setting. It has been expanded to a comprehensive system to allow for more in-depth classification of scapular fractures for clinical research and surgical decision making. It focusses on three specific regions of the scapula: the scapular body, the glenoid fossa and the lateral scapular suspension system (LSSS). This article presents a classification of the LSSS involvement to better characterise the injuries of this region and to emphasise its relevance to evaluation of the position of the scapula, hence the glenoid fossa, and so the centre of rotation of the shoulder joint. Methods An iterative consensus and evaluation process comprising an international group of seven experienced shoulder specialist and orthopaedic trauma surgeons was used to specify and evaluate the failure of the LSSS associated with scapula fractures. This was supported by a series of agreement studies. The system considered lack of involvement (S0), incomplete (S1) and complete (S2) failure of the LSSS. The last evaluation was conducted on a consecutive collection of 120 scapula fractures documented by three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) reconstruction videos. Results Surgeons agreed on the involvement/failure of the LSSS in 47% of the 120 cases with an overall Kappa of 0.54. The sample most likely included 70 S0, 29 S1 and 21 S2 cases, where surgeons showed median classification accuracies of 93%, 71% and 80% for these categories, respectively. While two surgeons showed some uncertainty about their classification, the remaining surgeons only failed to identify LSSS failure in <20% of the cases. Kappa coefficients of reliability for classification of incomplete and complete LSSS involvement according to subcategories were 0.85 and 0.82, respectively. Conclusion While LSSS involvement can be reliably identified, its characterisation regarding complexity is problematic even with 3D CT images. The proposed LSSS system is considered clinically relevant and sufficient to further assess its role in treatment-decision processes and outcome prognosis. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Surgical management of recurrent shoulder instability can be complicated in the setting of associated osseous defects of the glenoid, humeral head, or both. A wide variety of surgical options exist for the management of complex shoulder instability. Interventions for addressing glenoid and humeral head bone defects, and their biomechanical effects, are reviewed. Further studies are required to delineate critical defect values and develop validated treatment algorithms. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Introduction This study aimed to evaluate the two-year clinical outcomes of arthroscopic Bankart repair augmented by plication of the inferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL) via horizontal mattress suturing. Methods This study was a retrospective analysis of 76 arthroscopic Bankart repairs by a single surgeon from 2004 to 2008. Bioabsorbable suture anchors were used, with anchors placed at the 5:30, 4 and 3 o'clock positions of the right shoulder (correspondingly at the 6:30, 8 and 9 o'clock positions for the left shoulder). The lower most anchor was tied via horizontal mattress suture with plication of the IGHL, while the remaining two anchors were tied using simple sutures. The patients were postoperatively assessed, clinically and using the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder rating scale. Resu lts The mean age of the patients at the time of presentation was 24.09 ± 7.98 years, and the mean duration of follow-up was 28.7 months. The postoperative recurrence rate of dislocation was 7.89% (six shoulders), of which five shoulders required revision surgeries. Excluding the revision cases, clinical assessment of the strength of the supraspinatus and the range of motion of the operated shoulders at two years post operation were either maintained or full in all patients. Analysis of the UCLA results showed pre- and postoperative mean scores of 25.94 ± 3.43 and 33.77 ± 3.07, respectively (p < 0.05). Conclusion Arthroscopic Bankart repair augmented by plication of the IGHL and anchored via horizontal mattress suturing is a safe and reliable treatment for shoulder instability, with good clinical outcomes and low recurrence rates.

N2  - The purpose of our study was to establish criterion-related validity and repeatability of a shoulder biomechanics testing protocol involving an electromagnetic tracking system (Flock of Birds [FoB]). Eleven subjects completed humeral elevation tasks in the sagittal, scapular, and frontal planes on two occasions. Shoulder kinematics were assessed with a digital inclinometer and the FoB. Intrasession and intersession repeatability for orthopedic angles, and humeral and scapular kinematics ranged from moderate to excellent. Correlation analyses revealed strong relationships between inclinometer and FoB measures of humeral motion, yet considerable mean differences were noted between the measurement devices. Our results validate use of the FoB for measuring humeral kinematics and establish our testing protocol as reliable. We must continue to consider factors that can impact system accuracy and the effects they may have on kinematic descriptions and how data are reported. © 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc.

N2  - The work describes and compares the conformation traits and gait characteristics in the main native Iberian dressage Purebreds (Lusitano, Spanish and Menorca horses). In total, 4 strides belonging to each of 66 males (4-14. years old) were recorded at handled trot, using a 3D semi-automatic movement analysis system. Principal component analysis (PCA) and intraclass Correlations (iC) were computed. The Menorca Purebred showed proportionally higher limbs (23.8 and 15.1. cm for the forelimb cannon and pastern lengths), the Lusitano Purebred had larger inclinations (66.1°, 37.7° and 47.9° for the scapula and pastern angles), and the Spanish Purebred presented a longer scapula (41.5. cm) and a larger hip angle (132.1°), apparently showing a better conformation for dressage gaits. However, the three breeds presented undesirable tarsus joint conformation (<155.5°) for dressage performance. In general, all of them showed good features in the kinematics of the forelimbs. Nevertheless, the functional capacity of their hindlimbs and linear parameters probably need to be improved for their competitiveness. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Many osteological collections from museums and research institutions consist mainly of remains from captive-bred animals. The restrictions related to the space of their enclosures and the nature of its substrate are likely to affect the locomotor and postural behaviors of captive-bred animals, which are widely considered uninformative regarding bone morphology and anatomical adaptations of wild animals, especially so in the case of extant great apes. We made a landmark-based geometric morphometrics analysis of the dorsal side of the scapular bone of both wild-caught and captive-bred great apes to clarify the effect of captivity on the morphology of a bone greatly involved in locomotion. The comparison suggested that captivity did not have a significant effect on the landmark configuration used, neither on average scapular shape nor shape variability, being impossible to distinguish the scapulae of a captive-bred animal from that of a wild-caught one. This indicates that the analyzed scapulae from captive Hominoidea specimens may be used in morphological or taxonomic analyses since they show no atypical morphological traits caused by living conditions in captivity.

N2  - Musculoskeletal shoulder models allow non-invasive prediction of parameters that cannot be measured, particularly the loading applied to morphological structures and neurological control. This insight improves treatment and avoidance of pathology and performance evaluation and optimisation. A lack of appropriate validation and knowledge of model parameters' accuracy may cause reduced clinical success for these models. Instrumented implants have recently been used to validate musculoskeletal models, adding important information to the literature. This development along with increasing prevalence of shoulder models necessitates a fresh review of available models and their utility. The practical uses of models are described. Accuracy of model inputs, modelling techniques and model sensitivity is the main technical review undertaken. Collection and comparison of these parameters are vital to understanding disagreement between model outputs. Trends in shoulder modelling are highlighted: validation through instrumented prostheses, increasing openness and strictly constrained, optimised, measured kinematics. Future directions are recommended: validation through focus on model sub-sections, increased subject specificity with imaging techniques determining muscle and body segment parameters and through different scaling and kinematics optimisation approaches.

N2  - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 4-year-old sexually intact male Labrador Retriever-Poodle mix was admitted to the hospital for treatment of a wound in the left thoracic region. The wound had been debrided and primary closure had been performed by the referring veterinarian 4 days previously.
CLINICAL FINDINGS: The dog had a 20-cm-long wound covered by a large flap of skin that extended caudally from the scapula over the left side of the thorax. A 3-cm defect was evident at the cranioventral aspect of the wound, from which purulent material was being discharged. The skin flap was necrotic, and the skin surrounding the flap was bruised. Signs of pain were elicited when the wound and surrounding region were palpated. Other findings, including those of thoracic radiography, were unremarkable.
TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: The wound was debrided, and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) was initiated for 3 days until a healthy bed of granulation tissue developed. A reconstructive procedure was performed with a rotation flap 3 days after VAC dressing removal. The VAC process was reinitiated 2 days following reconstruction because of an apparent failing of the skin flap viability. After 5 days of VAC, the flap had markedly improved in color and consistency and VAC was discontinued. Successful healing of the flap occurred without the need for debridement or additional intervention.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Use of VAC led to a good overall outcome for the dog, with complete healing achieved. Additional evaluation of this technique for salvaging failing skin flaps is warranted in dogs, particularly considering that no reliable method for flap salvage in veterinary species has been reported to date.

A systematic, computerised literature search of PubMED, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library databases (from database inception through January 2012) using keywords related to diagnostic accuracy of physical examination tests of the scapula. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool was used to critique the quality of each paper. Eight articles met the inclusion criteria; three were considered to be of high quality. Of the three high-quality studies, two were in reference to a 'diagnosis' of shoulder pain. Only one high-quality article referenced specific shoulder pathology of acromioclavicular dislocation with reported sensitivity of 71% and 41% for the scapular dyskinesis and SICK scapula test, respectively. Overall, no physical examination test of the scapula was found to be useful in differentially diagnosing pathologies of the shoulder.

N2  - Background: Acromial fractures following reverse shoulder arthroplasty are difficult to identify and have variable effects on outcomes. A reproducible classification system is needed to categorize these fractures before it is possible to evaluate optimal treatment. The purposes of this study were to investigate the ability of radiographs to detect acromial fractures and establish fracture union, and to assess the reliability of a new classification system of postoperative acromial fractures based on the involvement of the deltoid origin. Methods: Eighteen patients presenting with pain along the acromion or scapular spine following reverse shoulder arthroplasty were evaluated for acromial fractures over a period of fifty-six months. If radiographic findings were negative, computed tomography (CT) scans were performed. Sixteen acromial fractures were identified and classified into subtypes on the basis of the deltoid muscle origin: type I indicated involvement of a portion of the anterior and middle deltoid origin; type II, at least the entire middle deltoid origin with a portion but not all of the posterior deltoid origin; and type III, the entire middle and posterior deltoid origin. The average age of the patients at the time of surgery was seventy-seven years (range, fifty-seven to eighty-seven years); the average duration of follow-up after surgery was twenty-five months (range, seven to forty-eight months). All fractures were treated nonoperatively. Blinded, fellowship-trained shoulder surgeons reviewed images that best illustrated the fracture, and the interobserver reliability of the classification system was evaluated. The reliability of radiographs to detect the fracture at the time of the initial presentation of pain and to observe ultimate fracture union was evaluated. Results: Interobserver reliability of the classification system was excellent (interclass correlation coefficient of 0.96). Radiographs were unreliable at detecting acromial fractures at the time of the initial presentation of pain (k =20.5) and at determining fracture union (k = 0.05). Conclusions: Radiographs may be unreliable for detecting acromial fractures after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, and CT scans are often needed to identify the fracture. Once identified, postoperative acromial fractures can be reliably classified into three subtypes. Nonoperative treatment of postoperative acromial fractures results in limitation of functional outcomes. Level of Evidence: Diagnostic Level III.

N2  - Background: Aberrations in scapular motion are believed to be associated with the presence of shoulder or elbow pathologies. There are many methods to evaluate scapular kinematics, but they have certain limitations. Nevertheless, it is believed that appropriate rehabilitation for each type of scapular dyskinesis is important. Methods: Eighty-nine athletes were videotaped and seven blinded observers categorized scapular dyskinesis into 4 types, which was followed by 3-dimensional (3D) wing computer tomography (CT). Four blinded examiners evaluated 5 angles [upward rotation (UR), internal rotation (IR), anterior tilting (AT), superior translation (ST), and protraction (PRO)] on the 3D wing CT. Inter-rater reliability (IRR) was calculated for both the methods. CT scan measurements were compared with the 4 observational types to establish the validity. Results: The IRR with observational assessment of scapular dyskinesis into 4 types was good, 0.780. The 3D wing CT analysis had a very high IRR, 0.972. There was a statistically significant correlation between observational assessment and 3D wing CT analysis. The UR angle, ST angle in type 3 scapular dyskinesis, and AT angle in type 1 scapular dyskinesis were increased as compared with those in the other types of scapular dyskinesis. All these measurements were made in the resting position of the scapula. Conclusion: The 3D wing CT analysis allows precise quantification of a position associated with scapular dyskinesis. Therefore, 3D wing CT can be considered as an alternative method for assessing scapular dyskinesis. © 2013 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Objective: Knowledge of the normal and pathological three-dimensional glenohumeral relationship is imperative when planning and performing a total shoulder arthroplasty. There is, however, no consensus on which references should be used when studying this relationship. The purpose of the present study was to define the most suitable glenoid plane with normally distributed parameters, narrowest variability, and best reproducibility. Materials and methods: Three-dimensional reconstruction CT scans were performed on 152 healthy shoulders. Four glenoid planes, each determined by three surgically accessible bony reference points, were determined. Two planes were triangular, with the same base defined by the most anterior and posterior point of the glenoid. The most inferior and the most superior point of the glenoid, respectively, define the top of Saller's inferior plane and the Saller's superior plane. The two other planes are formed by best-fitting circles. The circular max plane is defined by the superior tubercle, and two points at the distal third of the glenoid. The circular inferior plane is defined by three points at the rim of the inferior quadrants of the glenoid. Results: The parameters of all four planes behave normally. The humeral center of rotation is identically positioned for both the circular max and circular inferior plane (X = 91.71 /X = 91.66 p = 0.907 and Y = 90.83 /Y = 91.7 p = 0.054, respectively) and different for the Saller's inferior and Saller's superior plane (p ≤ 0.001). The circular inferior plane has the lowest variability to the coronal scapular plane (p < 0.001). Conclusions: This study provides arguments to use the circular inferior glenoid plane as preferred reference plane of the glenoid. © 2013 ISS.

N2  - Arthroscopic fixation of bony Bankart lesions in the setting of anterior shoulder instability has had successful long-term results. Key factors such as patient positioning, portal placement, visualization, mobilization of bony/soft tissues, and anatomic reduction and fixation are crucial to yield such results. We present a modified Sugaya technique that is reproducible and based on such key principles. This technique facilitates ease of anchor and suture placement to allow for anatomic reduction and fixation. © 2013 Arthroscopy Association of North America.

N2  - The glenohumeral joint is the most dislocated joint in the body due to the lack of bony constraints and the dependence on soft tissue for stability. The roles that various structures provide to joint function are important for understanding injury treatment and orthopaedic device design purposes. The goal of this study was to develop a computational model of the glenohumeral joint whereby joint behaviour was dictated by articular contact, ligamentous constraints, muscle loading and external perturbations. The bone structure of the computational model consisted of assembled computer tomographic images of the scapula, humerus and clavicle. The soft tissue elements were composed of forces and tension-only springs that represented muscles and ligaments. Validation of this model was achieved by comparing computational predictions to the results of a cadaveric experiment in which the relative contribution of muscles and ligaments to anterior joint stability was examined. The computational model predicted an anterior subluxation force that was similar to the cadaveric experimental results in humeral external rotation. The individual structure results showed the subscapularis to be critical to stabilisation in both neutral and external rotations, the biceps stabilised the joint in neutral but not in external rotation, and the inferior glenohumeral ligament resisted anterior displacement only in external rotation. The model's predictions were similar to the conclusions of the cadaveric experiment and the literature. Knowledge gained from this type of model could assist in further understanding the contribution of soft tissue stabilisers to joint function, pre-operative planning or the design of orthopaedic implants. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Hypothesis: In this study, we aim to test whether scapular winging results in a significant change in glenohumeral translation in the initial phase of the throwing motion. Methods: Six shoulders underwent an abbreviated throwing motion (ATM) from late cocking to the end of acceleration by use of a validated robotic system. The intact specimens were tested to establish a baseline. The position of the scapula was then affected to simulate scapular winging by placing a cylindrical wedge under the inferior angle of the scapula, and the ATM was performed again. For both conditions, the average glenohumeral translations and scapular rotations were plotted over time to calculate the area under the curve, as a representative of the overall glenohumeral translations and scapular rotations observed during the ATM. Results: Throughout the motion, the winged scapulae showed, on average, 7.7° more upward rotation, 1.6° more internal rotation, and 5.3° more anterior tipping as compared with the baseline. The scapular position relative to the hanging arm was significantly different between the baseline and scapular winging conditions in all arm positions, except for maximal external rotation and the neutral position. Comparing the area under the curve at baseline and with scapular winging indicated that scapular winging significantly increased anterior translation of the glenohumeral joint whereas translation in the superior/inferior and medial/lateral directions did not result in a change in translation. Discussion: These results may suggest a more important role of abnormalities in scapular position in predisposing throwing athletes to shoulder injuries of the anterior capsulolabral structures and consecutive glenohumeral instability. © 2013 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Rodents of the subfamily Sigmodontinae comprise a highly diversified group in the Atlantic Forest, with semifossorial, terrestrial, semiaquatic, scansorial, and arboreal forms. In this study, we analyzed morphometric variation in humerus, scapula, ulna, radius, femur, tibia, and pelvis to investigate its possible relationship with the different types of locomotion recorded in the literature. Skeletal characters were measured in 321 specimens belonging to 29 species and 19 genera either restricted to or recorded in this ecoregion. Multivariate morphometric analyses (principal component and canonical variate analyses) arranged individuals of different genera in groups congruent with the different types of locomotion. This arrangement was more clearly defined when analyses included only forelimb measurements, indicating that most of the variation in appendicular traits associated with the different locomotor modes occurs in the forelimb skeleton. Semifossorial forms exhibited the most distinct appendicular morphology, as well as the greatest frequency of endemism among analyzed species. These results suggest that this mode of locomotion led to greater differentiation in semifossorial Atlantic forest sigmodontines than in terrestrial and arboreal forms, which were found to have more subtle differentiation and fewer endemics. Scansorial species could not be set apart from terrestrial ones in terms of appendicular morphology, suggesting that these two modes of locomotion are the most similar and generalized for the group, as they occur in most lineages in the subfamily. The results of this study corroborate previous observations on the relevance of appendicular characters in the differentiation of species and genera in the subfamily Sigmodontinae. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Background: Despite numerous methodological flaws in previous study designs and the lack of validation in primary care populations, clinical tests for identifying acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) pain are widely utilised without concern for such issues. The aim of this study was to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of traditional ACJ tests and to compare their accuracy with other clinical examination features for identifying a predominant ACJ pain source in a primary care cohort. Methods. Consecutive patients with shoulder pain were recruited prospectively from primary health care clinics. Following a standardised clinical examination and diagnostic injection into the subacromial bursa, all participants received a fluoroscopically guided diagnostic block of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine™) into the ACJ. Diagnostic accuracy statistics including sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) were calculated for traditional ACJ tests (Active Compression/O'Brien's test, cross-body adduction, localised ACJ tenderness and Hawkins-Kennedy test), and for individual and combinations of clinical examination variables that were associated with a positive anaesthetic response (PAR) (P≤0.05) defined as 80% or more reduction in post-injection pain intensity during provocative clinical tests. Results: Twenty two of 153 participants (14%) reported an 80% PAR. None of the traditional ACJ tests were associated with an 80% PAR (P<0.05) and combinations of traditional tests were not able to discriminate between a PAR and a negative anaesthetic response (AUC 0.507; 95% CI: 0.366, 0.647; P>0.05). Five clinical examination variables (repetitive mechanism of pain onset, no referred pain below the elbow, thickened or swollen ACJ, no symptom provocation during passive glenohumeral abduction and external rotation) were associated with an 80% PAR (P<0.05) and demonstrated an ability to accurately discriminate between an PAR and NAR (AUC 0.791; 95% CI 0.702, 0.880; P<0.001). Less than two positive clinical features resulted in 96% sensitivity (95% CI 0.78, 0.99) and a LR- 0.09 (95% CI 0.02, 0.41) and four positive clinical features resulted in 95% specificity (95% CI 0.90, 0.98) and a LR+ of 4.98 (95% CI 1.69, 13.84). Conclusions: In this cohort of primary care patients with predominantly subacute or chronic ACJ pain of non-traumatic onset, traditional ACJ tests were of limited diagnostic value. Combinations of other history and physical examination findings were able to more accurately identify injection-confirmed ACJ pain in this cohort. © 2013 Cadogan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - This study investigated whether postural configuration has a significant effect upon the kinematics of arm movements when humans performed unconstrained reach movements to visual targets. Eight subjects were required to reach to static visual targets (unperturbed REACH movements) or correct reach movements when the position of a target unexpectedly changed during the execution of a planned movement (perturbed reaches, or online corrections, OC). Subjects were required to execute REACH and OC movements in sitting and standing (STAND) positions. The height of the targets, distance from the right shoulder (acromion) and eccentricity in terms of the body midline were standardized between the two postural conditions before movements begun. Unperturbed REACH movements were executed to a central target placed at 130 % of outstretched arm length, along the midline (0). Perturbed (OC) movements involved subjects initiating an arm movement to the 0° target upon its illumination. Two hundred milliseconds after the onset of the hand movement, the 0° target was extinguished and the target at 60° to the right of the midline (still at 130 % outstretched arm distance) illuminated. Subjects had to correct their reach movements online to the new target. Results demonstrated that, despite evident differences in postural kinematics between the four experimental conditions (e.g. pelvis obliquity and trunk/pelvis rotation), postural configuration had little or no effect upon the endpoint kinematics of the finger. Most importantly, the STAND position, with its greater postural constraints, did not affect the time taken to initiate an OC, nor did it lengthen the time taken to complete the REACH or OC movements. Our results suggest, therefore, that postural constraints are accounted for by the central nervous system when executing complex arm reaching movements. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - The concept of motor equivalent combinations of arm muscles, or M-modes, was investigated during reaching to insert a pointer into a cylindrical target with and without an elbow perturbation. Five M-modes across 15 arm/scapula muscles were identified by principal component analysis with factor extraction. The relationship between small changes in the M-modes and changes in the position/orientation of the pointer were investigated by linear regression analyses. The results revealed a motor equivalent organization of the M-modes for perturbed compared with nonperturbed reaches, both with respect to hand position and orientation, especially in the first 100-ms postperturbation. Similar findings were obtained for motor equivalence computed based on changes in the joint configuration, although the kinematically defined motor equivalence was stronger for pointer orientation. The results support the hypothesis that the nervous system organizes muscles into M-modes and flexibly scales M-mode activation to preserve stable values of variables directly related to performance success. © 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc.

N2  - There is no evidence-based treatment algorithm established for acromioclavicular joint (AC joint) dislocation classified as type Rockwood III injury. Recent meta-analyses revealed no advantage of surgical treatment compared to the non-operative approach. Both surgical and non-surgical approaches have been reported with inconsistent results. Therefore, the hypothesis of the current study was that patients classified as having Rockwood grade III injury may have different degrees of horizontal AC joint instability. A total of 18 consecutive patients who had sustained a dislocation of the AC joint classified as Rockwood III were evaluated radiologically to quantify the horizontal instability of the AC joint. The specific radiological investigation included lateral stress x-rays (Alexander view) und axial stress x-rays with the affected arm in a horizontal adduction position. The dynamic horizontal instability of the AC joint was found to be independent of the vertical dislocation measured in the Rockwood classification. For further treatment studies Rockwood III injuries should be distinguished in patients presenting with or without a substantial horizontal AC joint instability.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the effects of base of support (BOS) and external loads on electromyographic (EMG) onset in the shoulder muscles during push-up exercises. Methods: Two levels of external load were applied at two levels of BOS stability during push-up exercises. EMG onset in six shoulder muscles was measured in 30 healthy participants. Results: With load set at 4% of body weight (BW), EMG onset in the lower trapezius (LT) (. P = 0.003) and biceps brachia (BB) (. P = 0.001) was significantly decreased with no load. Conversely, in other muscles (the upper trapezius (UT), teres major (TM), seratus anterior (SA) and deltoid posterior (DP)), time to EMG onset did not change significantly. No significant changes in EMG onset were observed with load at 2% of BW. The average time to EMG onset was significantly decreased for different stages of BOS instability in the LT (. P = 0.04) and UT (. P = 0.001). Conclusion: Both load and BOS instability reduce time to EMG onset, but BOS instability produces greater reductions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: It is commonly stated that supraspinatus initiates abduction; however, there is no direct evidence to support this claim. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to determine whether supraspinatus initiates shoulder abduction by activating prior to movement and significantly earlier than other shoulder muscles and to determine if load or plane of movement influenced the recruitment timing of supraspinatus. Methods: Electromyographic recordings were taken from seven shoulder muscles of fourteen volunteers during shoulder abduction in the coronal and scapular planes and a plane 30° anterior to the scapular plane, at 25%, 50% and 75% of maximum load. Initial activation timing of a muscle was determined as the time at which the average activation (over a 25. ms moving window) was greater than three standard deviations above baseline measures. Results: All muscles tested were activated prior to movement onset. Subscapularis was activated significantly later than supraspinatus, infraspinatus, deltoid and upper trapezius, while supraspinatus, infraspinatus, upper trapezius, lower trapezius, serratus anterior and deltoid all had similar initial activation times. The effects of load or plane of movement were not significant. Conclusions: Supraspinatus is recruited prior to movement of the humerus into abduction but not earlier than many other shoulder muscles, including infraspinatus, deltoid and axioscapular muscles. The common statement that supraspinatus initiates abduction is therefore, misleading. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Surgical management of shoulder pathologies has evolved tremendously during the past 3 decades, such that many lesions previously treated with open techniques are now addressed arthroscopically. Despite this movement, many surgeons and outcome studies continue to prefer open repairs as the gold standard, criticizing-with good reason-the reliability, reproducibility, and extended operative time of arthroscopic repairs, particularly with respect to anterior stabilizations and subscapularis repairs. With this in mind, we present the arthroscopic "subdeltoid approach," a novel standardized exposure technique for extracompartmental anterior shoulder arthroscopy. We define the subdeltoid space as the fascial plane bound superiorly by the acromion and coracoacromial ligament, medially by the coracoid and the conjoint tendon, inferiorly by the musculotendinous insertion of the pectoralis major to the humerus, and laterally by the lateral border of the humerus. When coupled with existing arthroscopic tools, this space dramatically enhances our ability to apply open techniques to some of the more challenging anterior shoulder pathoanatomy and expand the indications and efficacy of arthroscopy. This exposure technique has been used in more than 300 cases during the past decade to treat a myriad of shoulder pathologies, without any longstanding postoperative complications. © 2013 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - The purpose of this study is to introduce a novel concept of arthroscopic "bipolar fixation" in the treatment of recurrent anteroinferior shoulder dislocations. Between January 2008 and January 2011, 297 patients with the history of recurrent anteroinferior dislocations underwent either open Latarjet procedure or arthroscopic Bankart repair along with the tenodesis of infraspinatus and the posterior capsule (bipolar fixation) on to the bare area irrespective of the presence or absence of Hill-Sachs lesions and hyperlaxity. Twenty-six patients who underwent arthroscopic bipolar fixation in 2008 with a minimum follow-up of 2 years were included in this study. Hyperlaxity was noticed in 53% of the population. Seventy-four percent had Hill-Sachs lesions and glenoid defects were found in 30%. The average instability severity index score was 5.07. The patients were followed up with Walch-Duplay score and Subjective Shoulder Value. At 2-year follow-up, 100% had full range of motion without any deficits. Thirteen percent experienced some residual posterior pain, but all the 26 patients could get back to their sports activities. Eighty-five percent could get back to their previous level of sports. Subjective Shoulder Value improved from 53% to 95% postoperatively. The Walch-Duplay score was 95%. The lone failure (3.84%) was a case of attritional glenoid when he had a redislocation at 1 year postoperatively after a minor injury. Arthroscopic bipolar fixation restores a good balance between the injured anterior and the posterior capsuloligamentous structures. The technique is reliable and reproducible in posttraumatic recurrent anteroinferior dislocations regardless of the presence or absence of Hill-Sachs lesions. The absolute contraindication is a type 3 anterior glenoid defect. Nevertheless, further comparative studies need to be performed to confirm our results, and so far one should correct the pathology as found rather than routinely performing a "bipolar" tightening regularly.

N2  - Purpose: The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical outcome and radiographic findings after arthroscopic superior capsule reconstruction (ASCR) for symptomatic irreparable rotator cuff tears. Methods: From 2007 to 2009, 24 shoulders in 23 consecutive patients (mean, 65.1 years) with irreparable rotator cuff tears (11 large, 13 massive) underwent ASCR using fascia lata. We used suture anchors to attach the graft medially to the glenoid superior tubercle and laterally to the greater tuberosity. We added side-to-side sutures between the graft and infraspinatus tendon and between the graft and residual anterior supraspinatus/subscapularis tendon to improve force coupling. Physical examination, radiography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed before surgery; at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery; and yearly thereafter. Average follow-up was 34.1 months (24 to 51 months) after surgery. Results: Mean active elevation increased significantly from 84° to 148° (P <.001) and external rotation increased from 26° to 40° (P <.01). Acromiohumeral distance (AHD) increased from 4.6 ± 2.2 mm preoperatively to 8.7 ± 2.6 mm postoperatively (P <.0001). There were no cases of progression of osteoarthritis or rotator cuff muscle atrophy. Twenty patients (83.3%) had no graft tear or tendon retear during follow-up (24 to 51 months). The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score improved from 23.5 to 92.9 points (P <.0001). Conclusions: ASCR restored superior glenohumeral stability and function of the shoulder joint with irreparable rotator cuff tears. Our results suggest that this reconstruction technique is a reliable and useful alternative treatment for irreparable rotator cuff tears. Level of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic case series. © 2013 by the Arthroscopy Association of North America.

N2  - Family is societal institution that is conceptualized as “Vital” and “Valid” its importance is emphasized by social conservatives across cultures. Consanguinity is usually socially motivated and can be genetically harmful; it is a state of being descended from a common ancestor. It has been practiced by many societies around the globe from time immemorial, and a part of most civilizations as far back as the Old Testament of the Bible, and in the Arab world before the emerging of the Islam, and therefore, it is not monopoly where Islamic faith prevails. We scrutinize the effect of consanguinity on family health, its benefits and its detriments, and how should be tackled on medical and policy levels. We also pursue the Islamic attitude and discourses on the marriage custom, law, ethics and principles. Attention is then drawn to the cultural influences and challenges in the Arab word.

N2  - In biomechanical modelling and motion analysis, the use of personalised data such as bone geometry would provide more accurate and reliable results. However, there are still a limited number of tools used to measure the evolution of articular interactions. This paper proposes a coherence index to describe the articular status of contact surfaces during motion. The index relies on a robust estimation of the evolution of surfacic interactions between the joint surfaces. The index is first compared to distance maps on simulated motions. It is then used to compare two motion capture protocols (two different localisations of the markers for scapula tracking). The results show that the index detects progressive modifications in the joint and allows distinguishing the two protocols, in accordance with the literature. In the future, the index could, among other things, be used to compare/improve biomechanical models and motion analysis protocols. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Background: Acute acromioclavicular joint dislocations indicated for surgery can be treated with several stabilization techniques. This in vitro study evaluated the acromioclavicular joint stability after 3 types of validated repair techniques compared with the native situation. Materials and methods: Nine pairs (right-left) of intact cadaveric shoulder specimens were assigned to 3 study groups with randomly distributed samples according to the coracoclavicular distance. The groups were instrumented with acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular cerclages (CE), a Twin Tail TightRope (TR), or a locking compression superior and anterior clavicle plate (CP). Native and instrumented specimens were tested quasi-static nondestructively (superior: 70 N; anteroposterior: ±35 N, 10 mm/min) and cyclically until failure (superior, valley load: 20 N; initial peak load: 70 N; increment: 0.02 N/cycle). Results: The TR study group showed the highest (in N/mm) superoinferior (73.77 ± 14.04) and anteroposterior (29.58 ± 1.52) stiffness, followed by CE (superoinferior: 59.73 ± 10.33; anteroposterior: 24.31 ± 4.14) and CP (superoinferior: 24.08 ± 5.29). Instrumentation generally led to increased superoinferior and anteroposterior stiffness in each study group but to a significant superoinferior stiffness reduction for CP (. P = .029). Significantly lower coracoclavicular displacement at valley load after 1 and 500 cycles was observed for TR (. P = .018) and CE (. P = .041) compared with CP. Cycles to failure were significantly higher in CE (7298 ± 1244 cycles, P = .011) and TR (4434 ± 727 cycles, P = .031) compared with CP (1683 ± 509 cycles). Conclusions: The CE and TR techniques led to similar biomechanical performances. The CE repair might mimic the native acromioclavicular joint stiffness better than the other 2 setups, leading to more physiological stabilization. © 2013 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Background: Functional deficits and changes in scapular mechanics following breast cancer (BC) treatments have been documented. Scapular assessment is important when examining the shoulder in survivors of breast cancer to document the need for or effectiveness of physical therapy intervention. The Oncology Section Task Force on Breast Cancer Outcomes sought to identify scapular examination tools that can be recommended for routine use in individuals treated for BC. Methods: A systematic review of the literature on scapular measures was conducted. Relevant studies were examined for psychometric properties and clinical usefulness. Each method was given a recommendation score based on the Breast Cancer EDGE (Evidence Database to Guide Effectiveness) criteria. Results: Only Dynamic Motion Assessment was recommended for clinical use. The remaining tools lacked either good psychometric properties or clinical usefulness. Conclusions: Measurement of scapular motion remains a challenge and reliable and valid measures must precede further research into scapular problems among survivors of breast cancer.

N2  - The glenopolar angle assesses the rotational alignment of the glenoid and may provide prognostic information and aid the management of scapula fractures. We have analysed the effect of the anteroposterior (AP) shoulder radiograph rotational offset on the glenopolar angle in a laboratory setting and used this to assess the accuracy of shoulder imaging employed in routine clinical practice. Fluoroscopic imaging was performed on 25 non-paired scapulae tagged with 2 mm steel spheres to determine the orientation of true AP views. The glenopolar angle was measured on all the bony specimens rotated at 10° increments. The mean glenopolar angle measured on the bone specimens in rotations between 0° and 20° and thereafter was found to be significantly different (p < 0.001). We also obtained the AP radiographs of the uninjured shoulder of 30 patients treated for fractures at our centre and found that none fitted the criteria of a true AP shoulder radiograph. The mean angular offset from the true AP view was 38° (10° to 65°) for this cohort. Radiological AP shoulder views may not fully project the normal anatomy of the scapular body and the measured glenopolar angle. The absence of a true AP view may compromise the clinical management of a scapular fracture. © 2013 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.

N2  - Purpose: A semiautomatic method for the assessment of ligament length variations during different joint positions based on MRI data is proposed. Methods: Ligament lengths are represented as distances between points marking characteristic locations in the ligament insertion regions on the bones. These points are defined manually for one single reference joint position and for all other joint positions they are automatically mapped with high accuracy to the correct locations using image registration methods. The methodology is validated using data from 16 volunteers depicting the coracoclavicular ligaments in the left shoulder during different arm abductions. Results: The method yielded a superior reproducibility of the point locations over different joint positions compared to manual point marking. Significant ligament length variations were found for different abductions which was not possible with manual measurements. Acquisition related geometric distortions and inaccuracies during the registration and segmentation process were small. Conclusions: The proposed method provides superior accuracy for the in vivo analysis of ligament dynamics compared to manual measurements. This permits a better understanding of the ligament behavior during joint motion and offers new possibilities for presurgical planning which to date has not been possible with manual data analysis. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

N2  - Optoelectronic systems are widely used in 3D motion capture. However, the reliability of the motion estimation depends on soft tissue artefacts and should therefore be validated. Two different sets of humeral markers were studied on four subjects. Anatomical and kinematic measurements were combined and the plausibility of the relative position of the bones in the glenohumeral joint during motion was evaluated using a new coherence index. Our findings show that an identical protocol leads to a large variability of the articular coherence for the subjects. However, the use of an extra marker on the distal part of the humerus improves the humeral kinematics for three of the four subjects. Scientists and clinicians using 3D systems should remain aware of the influence of subject-specific morphology on the accuracy of the measure. Differences with a reference group may come from clinical reasons but also from measurement errors due to the inter-individual morphological differences. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Shoulder pain is one of the common complaints to physicians in general practice. Among therapeutic measures used to treat this pain, invasive techniques, such as joints and periarticular injection, as well as suprascapular and axillary nerve block, play a crucial role. Ultrasound guidance is a safe alternative to blind techniques, increasing the safety and accuracy of the procedure and reducing complications. A good understanding of the anatomy and sonoanatomy is of paramount importance in performing the ultrasound-guided injections. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Introduction:Abnormal scapular movements and position is related to shoulder dysfunctions. Lateral scapular slide test is used to determine scapular position in coronal plane; however, different studies have shown conflicting results for the reliability of the test in position of 90 degrees of abduction. According to the more functionality of scaption compare to the abduction as well as scaption is a familiar task for athletes, in current study, 90 degrees of scaption was used instead of 90 degrees of abduction and then the reliability of modified lateral scapular slide test (MLSST) was evaluated. Materials and Methods: Fifteen healthy overhead sport-men, aged 20 to 40, were recruited in the study. The minimal vertical distance between inferior angle of scapula and spinous process of T7 was measured by two examiners in one session and by one examiner in the next week using a caliper in neutral position (arm is relaxed at the side), 90 degrees of scaption and 180 degrees of elevation. Results: Reliability in neutral position was maximum (ICC 0.83 to 0.97, good to high). In 90 degrees of scaption, inter-rater and intra-rater reliability were 0.70 to 0.75 and 0.65 to 0.83, respectively. In 180 degrees of elevation, inter-rater reliability was 0.58 and intra-rater reliability was 0.84 to 0.89. Conclusion: 90 degrees of Scaption and 180 degrees of elevation, as a functional position in the athletes, may be used as choice positions in lateral scapular slide test.

N2  - Background The effect of high-speed movement on scapula kinematics is not clear from the literature. Understanding these effects is important for clinicians examining, managing and understanding scapula kinematic pathologies: impingement, glenohumeral instability, muscle patterning instability and athletic injuries. The scapula tracking methodology and the lack of quantified control of the movement's plane of elevation limits previous studies. The aim of the present study is to use improved dynamic scapula kinematic measurement to assess differences during planar movements across different speeds. Athletic and maximal speeds, neglected in previous studies, are the focus. Methods Thirteen subjects performed slow, fast and maximal scapula plane abduction and forward flexion. A previously validated skin-fixed scapula tracker was used and optimally calibrated. A stiff board controlled the plane of elevation. Scapula kinematics were consistent with the literature. Findings Large and statistically significant differences were found to exist between scapula kinematics at slow speeds compared to fast and maximal speeds in lateral rotation and protraction. Although some differences were observed in the plane of elevation between speeds, these were not considered to effect the conclusions. Interpretation The speed of movement should be considered an important factor affecting scapula kinematics. Clinical studies analysing muscle recruitment strategies and causes of injury in athletic tasks must account for changing kinematics rather than extrapolating slow or static measures and effective clinical examination and management of pathology must take these kinematic changes into account. Control of the plane of movement is challenging and its effectiveness must be quantified in future kinematic studies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to validate a reverse shoulder computer impingement model and quantify the impact of implant position on scapular impingement by comparing it to that of a radiographic analysis of 256 patients who received the same prosthesis and were followed postoperatively for an average of 22.2 months. Methods: A geometric computer analysis quantified anterior and posterior scapular impingement as the humerus was internally and externally rotated at varying levels of abduction and adduction relative to a fixed scapula at defined glenoid implant positions. These impingement results were compared to radiographic study of 256 patients who were analyzed for notching, glenoid baseplate position, and glenosphere overhang. Results: The computer model predicted no impingement at 0° humeral abduction in the scapular plane for the 38 mm, 42 mm, and 46 mm devices when the glenoid baseplate cage peg is positioned 18.6 mm, 20.4 mm, and 22.7 mm from the inferior glenoid rim (of the reamed glenoid) or when glenosphere overhang of 4.6 mm, 4.7 mm, and 4.5 mm was obtained with each size glenosphere, respectively. When compared to the radiographic analysis, the computer model correctly predicted impingement based upon glenoid baseplate position in 18 of 26 patients with scapular notching and based upon glenosphere overhang in 15 of 26 patients with scapular notching. Conclusions: Reverse shoulder implant positioning plays an important role in scapular notching. The results of this study demonstrate that the computer impingement model can effectively predict impingement based upon implant positioning in a majority of patients who developed scapular notching clinically. This computer analysis provides guidance to surgeons on implant positions that reduce scapular notching, a well-documented complication of reverse shoulder arthroplasty.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The shoulder has the greatest range of motion of any joint in the human body. This is due, in part, to the complex interplay between the glenohumeral (GH) joint and the scapulothoracic (ST) articulation. Currently, our ability to study shoulder kinematics is limited, because existing models isolate the GH joint and rely on manual manipulation to create motion, and have low reproducibility. Similarly, most established techniques track shoulder motion discontinuously with limited accuracy.
METHODS: To overcome these problems, we have designed a novel system in which the shoulder girdle is studied intact, incorporating both GH and ST motions. In this system, highly reproducible trajectories are created using a robotic actuator to control the intact shoulder girdle. High-speed cameras are employed to track retroreflective bone markers continuously.
RESULTS: We evaluated this automated system's capacity to reproducibly capture GH translation in intact and pathologic shoulder conditions. A pair of shoulders (left and right) were tested during forward elevation at baseline, with a winged scapula, and after creation of a full thickness supraspinatus tear.
DISCUSSION: The system detected differences in GH translations as small as 0.5 mm between different conditions. For each, three consecutive trials were performed and demonstrated high reproducibility and high precision.

N2  - A patient presented at our clinic with severe subacromial bursitis, which persisted for several months following a third booster injection with Cervarix™. Chronic subacromial bursitis manifested itself in this patient after what appeared to be the misinjection of vaccine in close proximity to the acromion. This bursitis was resistant to conventional physiotherapy and to corticosteroid therapy, but was responsive to arthroscopic surgery. Since such patients may present to an arthroscopic surgeon only months after receiving a vaccine injection, this etiological link may not be fully appreciated by treating clinicians. Further, the accuracy of injection in the deltoid region also appears under appreciated, and this report highlights the importance of accurate injection to the deltoid region or in certain cases, the value of simply changing the injection site to another larger muscle. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - We present our novel arthroscopic anatomic double-bundle coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction technique using a semitendinosus tendon autograft. The dorsal limb of the graft is positioned around the dorsal edge of the clavicle, re-creating the conoid ligament. The anterior limb proceeds superiorly and re-creates the trapezoid ligament. The solution effectively stabilizes the acromioclavicular joint and prevents anterior posterior translation. This new arthroscopic double-bundle coracoclavicular joint reconstruction is an effective and reliable method in stabilizing the clavicle and neutralizing the anterior-posterior translation, and we find it to be technically practical for the surgeon. © 2012 Arthroscopy Association of North America.

N2  - Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Objectives: To assess scapular kinematics and electromyographic signal amplitude of the shoulder musculature, before and after thoracic spine manipulation (TSM) in subjects with rotator cuff tendinopathy (RCT). Changes in range of motion, pain, and function were also assessed. Background: There are various treatment techniques for RCT. Recent studies suggest that TSM may be a useful component in the management of pain and dysfunction associated with RCT. Methods: Thirty subjects between 18 and 45 years of age, who showed signs of RCT, participated in this study. Changes in scapular kinematics and muscle activity, as well as changes in shoulder pain and function, were assessed pre-TSM and post-TSM using paired t tests and repeated-measures analyses of variance. Results: TSM did not lead to changes in range of motion or scapular kinematics, with the exception of a small decrease in scapular upward rotation (P = .05). The only change in muscle activity was a small but significant increase in middle trapezius activity (P = .03). After TSM, subjects demonstrated decreased pain during performance of the Jobe empty-can (mean ± SD change, 2.6 ± 1.1), Neer (2.6 ± 1.3), and Hawkins-Kennedy (2.8 ± 1.3) tests (all, P<.001). Subjects also reported decreased pain with shoulder flexion (mean ± SD change, 2.0 ± 1.5; P<.001) and improved shoulder function (force production, 2.5 ± 1.4 kg; Penn Shoulder Score, 7.7 ± 9.4; sports/performing arts module of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire, 16.4 ± 13.2) (all, P<.001). Conclusion: Immediate improvements in shoulder pain and function post-TSM are not likely explained by alterations in scapular kinematics or shoulder muscle activity. For people with pain associated with RCT, TSM may be an effective component of their treatment plan to improve pain and function. However, further randomized controlled studies are necessary to better validate this treatment approach. Copyright © 2012 Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy.

N2  - Posterior glenohumeral instability remains a difficult problem. There are still many controversies regarding surgical treatment, due to a lack of understanding the pathomechanical issues leading to posterior instability. This article presents a new arthroscopic technique of posterior bone block augmentation, which we found to be effective, repeatable and successful. This technique can be used for combined soft tissue and bony defects as well as for revisions after previous soft tissue reconstructions. © Istituti Ortopedici Rizzoli 2012.

N2  - Background: Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty has shown promising early and midterm results; however, complication rates remain a concern. Glenoid loosening and notching, for example, can be deleterious to the long-term success. A 15° inferior inclination angle has been shown to offer the most uniform compressive forces across the base plate and the least micromotion at the base plate-glenoid interface. The inferior inclination angle may also avoid scapular notching. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of obtaining 15° of inferior inclination of the base plate. Methods: The radiographs of 138 reverse total shoulder patients were included. Overall, glenoid inclination and change in inclination from preoperative radiographs were measured using a previously described standardized method. Measurements were obtained by 2 orthopedic surgeons, who repeated all measurements 3 weeks apart. The final angle and change in inclination were averaged. Results: Seventy-two patients had pre- and postoperative radiographs of sufficient quality to accurately measure inclination. Average pre- and postoperative inclination measured -4.8° (-27.2° to 28.1°) and -13.3° (-22.8° to 43.6°), respectively. The average change in inclination was -8.5° (-53.7o to 34.6o). No scapular notching was observed, which may relate to the lateralized center of rotation of the implant used in this study. Discussion: Overall, the average decrease in inclination was very close to the intended target value using the standard guide. However, patients with preoperative superior glenoid erosion from advanced rotator cuff tear arthropathy appeared to be consistently tilted superiorly, suggesting the standard guide may be inadequate in these patients. © 2012 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Alterations in scapular muscle activity, including excess activation of the upper trapezius (UT) and onset latencies of the lower trapezius (LT) and serratus anterior (SA) muscles, are associated with abnormal scapular motion and shoulder impingement. Limited information exists on the reliability of neuromuscular activity to demonstrate the efficacy of interventions. The purpose of this study was to characterize the reproducibility of scapular muscle activity (mean activity, relative onset timing) over time and establish the minimal detectable change (MDC). Surface electromyography (sEMG) of the UT, LT, SA and anterior deltoid (AD) muscles in 16 adults were captured during an overhead lifting task in two sessions, one-week apart. sEMG data were also normalized to maximum isometric contraction and the relative onset and mean muscle activity during concentric and eccentric phases of the scapular muscles were calculated. Additionally, reliability of the absolute sEMG data during the lifting task and MVIC was evaluated. Both intrasession and intersession reliability of normalized and absolute mean scapular muscle activity, assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), ranged from 0.62 to 0.99; MDC values were between 1.3% and 11.7% MVIC and 24 to 135. mV absolute sEMG. Reliability of sEMG during MVIC was ICC = 0.82-0.99, with the exception of intersession upper trapezius reliability (ICC = 0.36). Within session reliability of muscle onset times was ICC = 0.88-0.97, but between session reliability was lower with ICC = 0.43-0.73; MDC were between 39 and 237. ms. Small changes in scapular neuromuscular mean activity (>11.7% MVIC) can be interpreted as meaningful change, while change in muscle onset timing in light of specific processing parameters used in this study is more variable. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background: There is major controversy surrounding the use of hemiarthroplasty as compared with total shoulder arthroplasty for glenohumeral osteoarthritis, and long-term clinical outcomes of hemiarthroplasty are lacking. Methods: Of a cohort of thirty patients (thirty-one shoulders) who were treated with hemiarthroplasty for glenohumeral osteoarthritis and followed longitudinally at our institution, twenty-five were available for long-term follow-up; five died, and one refused to participate. Three of the five patients who died had revision arthroplasty before death, and the data from those three were therefore included in the final follow-up (final follow-up data therefore included twenty-seven patients and twenty-eight shoulders). Follow-up through phone conversations and postal mail surveys included the following: Short Form-36, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) shoulder outcome score, EuroQol, Simple Shoulder Test, modified Neer Score, and a unique, validated self-administered range-of-motion questionnaire. Correlations between clinical outcome and age, type of glenoid wear, and cause of osteoarthritis were determined. Results: The average follow-up was 17.2 years (range, thirteen to twenty-one years). There were eight revisions (three of fifteen shoulders with concentric glenoids, and five of sixteen shoulders with eccentric glenoids). For those shoulders not revised, the average ASES score was 70.54 (range, 36.67 to 91.67). Overall, active shoulder forward elevation and external rotation with the arm at 90° of abduction increased from 104° preoperatively to 141.8° (range, 45° to 180°) and 20.7° to 61.0° (range, 30° to 90°), respectively (p &;lt; 0.05), at the time of final follow-up. Of those who required revision arthroplasty, the average patient age at the time of the index procedure was 51.0 years (range, twenty-six to eighty-one years), while those not requiring revision averaged 57.1 years (range, twenty-seven to sixty-three years). The overall Neer satisfaction rating was 25%. The average Neer score and Neer rating for unrevised cases were significantly higher for concentric glenoid wear compared with eccentric glenoid wear (p = 0.015 and p = 0.001, respectively). Patients who had concentric glenoid wear had higher EuroQol scores (p = 0.020). The average Neer scores were 65.29 (range, forty-seven to seventy-eight) for primary osteoarthritis and 54.46 (range, forty to seventy-seven) for secondary osteoarthritis (p = 0.036). Conclusions: Only 25% of patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis treated with shoulder hemiarthroplasty are satisfied with their outcome at an average of seventeen years after the operation. Patients with concentric glenoid wear and primary osteoarthritis have better outcomes than those with eccentric glenoid wear and secondary osteoarthritis do, but patients in both groups experienced deterioration of results over time.

N2  - Background. A recent study in our laboratory found significant differences in scapular kinematics between the affected and unaffected sides of women reporting shoulder pain following treatment for breast cancer. An earlier smaller study from our laboratory found reduced muscle activity from four key muscles and an association with greater shoulder pain and disability. The aims of this study were to: correlate altered muscle activity from a larger sample with observed movement deviations; compare within subject movement and muscle deviations in survivors with healthy variation; explore the impact of a mastectomy vs. a wide local excision (WLE) on the observed deviations. Method. Cross-sectional study. One hundred and fifty-five women treated for unilateral carcinoma of the breast and 21 age-matched healthy women were included in the study. All patients filled out the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). Three-dimensional (3D)-kinematic data and EMG muscle activity were recorded during scaption on the affected and unaffected side. The association between kinematic data, EMG data, SPADI and covariates was determined using a two stage, random effects mixed multiple regression technique. Results. All scapula kinematic and muscle EMG parameters in both arms were altered in breast cancer survivors when compared to healthy participants. Altered movement patterns were different for left vs. right side affected. Mastectomy patients demonstrated greater movement deviations and reported significantly higher levels of pain than WLE patients. Conclusion. Shoulder morbidity is bilateral, greater in patients having a mastectomy and is present for up to six years post-surgery. This study and others now provide ample evidence to support prospective surveillance programmes that can be integrated into Survivorship Programmes. © 2012 Informa Healthcare.

N2  - Fluoroscopic imaging, using single plane or dual plane images, has grown in popularity to measure dynamic in vivo human shoulder joint kinematics. However, no study has quantified the difference in spatial positional accuracy between single and dual plane image-model registration applied to the shoulder joint. In this paper, an automatic 2D-3D image-model registration technique was validated for accuracy and repeatability with single and dual plane fluoroscopic images. Accuracy was assessed in a cadaver model, kinematics found using the automatic registration technique were compared to those found using radiostereometric analysis. The in vivo repeatability of the automatic registration technique was assessed during the dynamic abduction motion of four human subjects. The in vitro data indicated that the error in spatial positional accuracy of the humerus and the scapula was less than 0.30. mm in translation and less than 0.58° in rotation using dual plane images. Single plane accuracy was satisfactory for in-plane motion variables, but out-of-plane motion variables on average were approximately 8 times less accurate. The in vivo test indicated that the repeatability of the automatic 2D-3D image-model registration was 0.50. mm in translation and 1.04° in rotation using dual images. For a single plane technique, the repeatability was 3.31. mm in translation and 2.46° in rotation for measuring shoulder joint kinematics. The data demonstrate that accurate and repeatable shoulder joint kinematics can be obtained using dual plane fluoroscopic images with an automatic 2D-3D image-model registration technique; and that out-of-plane motion variables are less accurate than in-plane motion variables using a single plane technique. © 2012 IPEM.

N2  - Purpose: A detailed morphometry of the Hill-Sachs lesion and quantification of its volume was studied in 71 patients with traumatic anterior shoulder instability with radiographs and computerized arthrotomography. Methods The accuracy of the conventional radiographs and Bernageau view to visualize the humeral and the glenoid lesion was also assessed. This study also analysed the depth of the Hill-Sachs lesion (D) and the humeral head radius (R) from conventional radiograph and its location from the computerized arthrotomography. All the findings were analysed and correlated with the outcome of the arthroscopic stabilization procedure. Results: Sensitivity for demonstrating the Hill-Sachs lesion for the 45° internal rotation anteroposterior radiograph was 84%, whereas sensitivity for demonstrating the glenoid lesion for the comparative Bernageau view was 68%. The mean D/R ratio, the lateralization angle and the volume of the Hill-Sachs lesion were 16.2%, 188° and 1,019 mm3, respectively. The mean Hill-Sachs lesion volume represented 2.28% of the total humeral head volume. The D/R ratio, the lateralization angle and the volume of the Hill-Sachs lesion were significantly high in the recurrent dislocation group, whereas the D/R ratio and the lesion volume were also significantly high in the group that did not perform well following the stabilization procedure. The recurrence rate in this study was 16.6%, majority being from the recurrent dislocation group. Conclusion: This study confirms the interest as risk factor for a simple and reproducible radiographic quantitative measure of the Hill-Sachs lesion: D/R.

N2  - Introduction: Bone defects in the humeral head or antero-inferior edge of the glenoid cavity increase recurrence risk following arthroscopic Bankart repair. The present study sought to quantify such preoperative defects using a simple radiological technique and to determine a threshold for elevated risk of recurrence. Materials and methods: A retrospective study conducted in two centers enrolled patients undergoing primary arthroscopic Bankart repair for isolated anterior shoulder instability in 2005. The principle assessment criterion was revision for recurrent instability. Quantitative radiology comprised: the ratio of notch depth to humeral head radius (D/R) on AP view in internal rotation; Gerber's X ratio between antero-inferior glenoid cavity edge defect length and maximum anteroposterior glenoid cavity diameter on arthro-CT scan; and the D1/D2 ratio between the glenoid joint surface diameters of the pathologic (D1) and healthy (D2) shoulders on Bernageau glenoid profile views. Seventy-seven patients were included, with a mean follow-up of 44 months (range, 36-54). Results: Overall recurrence rate was 15.6%. Recurrence risk was significantly greater when the humeral notch length was more or equal to 20% of the humeral head diameter and the Gerber ratio more or equal to 40%. On Bernageau views, mean D1/D2 ratio was 4.2% (range, 0-23%) in patients without recurrence, versus 5.1% (range, 0-19) in those with recurrence (P=0.003). Discussion: Beyond the above thresholds, bone defect as such contraindicates isolated arthroscopic stabilization. The D/R and Gerber ratios are simple and reproducible quantitative measurements can be taken in routine practice, enabling preoperative planning of complementary bone surgery as needed. Level of evidence: Level IV; retrospective cohort study. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Objective: To analyse the accuracy and reproducibility of photogrammetry in detecting thoracic abnormalities in infants born prematurely. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: The Premature Clinic at the Federal University of São Paolo. Participants: Fifty-eight infants born prematurely in their first year of life. Outcome measures: Measurement of the manubrium/acromion/trapezius angle (degrees) and the deepest thoracic retraction (cm). Digitised photographs were analysed by two blinded physiotherapists using a computer program (SAPO; http://SAPO.incubadora.fapesp.br) to detect shoulder elevation and thoracic retraction. Physical examinations performed independently by two physiotherapists were used to assess the accuracy of the new tool. Results: Thoracic alterations were detected in 39 (67%) and in 40 (69%) infants by Physiotherapists 1 and 2, respectively (kappa coefficient. =0.80). Using a receiver operating characteristic curve, measurement of the manubrium/acromion/trapezius angle and the deepest thoracic retraction indicated accuracy of 0.79 and 0.91, respectively. For measurement of the manubrium/acromion/trapezius angle, the Bland and Altman limits of agreement were -6.22 to 7.22° [mean difference (d). =0.5] for repeated measures by one physiotherapist, and -5.29 to 5.79° (d=0.75) between two physiotherapists. For thoracic retraction, the intra-rater limits of agreement were -0.14 to 0.18. cm (d=0.02) and the inter-rater limits of agreement were -0.20 to -0.17. cm (d=0.02). Conclusion: SAPO provided an accurate and reliable tool for the detection of thoracic abnormalities in preterm infants. © 2011 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.

N2  - Background: Radiostereometric analysis measures the position of rigid bodies in 3 dimensions with very high precision and can be used to measure early micromotion of glenoid implants. Materials and methods: Radiostereometric analysis was used to measure migration of 11 partially cemented fluted pegged glenoid components in patients with osteoarthritis who underwent shoulder arthroplasty during a 2-year period. Patients were evaluated using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Constant scores and by a computed tomography (CT) scan at the 2-year follow-up. Results: Migration patterns could be classified into 2 groups: The first group showed little if any migration, the second group rotated by 4° or more as early as 3 months after operation. The maximum total point motion reached up to 2 mm by the 6-month follow-up. At 12 months, the 2 groups could be identified by the presence or absence of focal lucency around the central peg. At the end of 2 years, CT scans were able to classify the same 2 migration patterns by the presence or absence of osseointegration around the cementless central peg of the glenoid implant. The clinical effect of the absence of osseointegration in this novel glenoid component is unknown because both groups had similar clinical results at 2 years. Conclusion: Rapid early migration associated with focal lucency and absence of osseointegration was observed in 6 of 11 components. We postulate that lack of initial fixation leads to early movement of the glenoid component and failure of osseointegration. © 2012 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - The immediate goal of this study was to develop and validate a noninvasive, computational surface mapping approach for measuring scapular kinematics by using available motion capture technology in an innovative manner. The long-term goal is to facilitate clinical determination of the role of the scapula in children with brachial plexus birth palsy (BPBP). The population for this study consisted of fourteen healthy adults with prominent scapulae. Subject-specific scapular templates were created using the coordinates of five scapular landmarks obtained from palpation with subjects seated and arms relaxed in a neutral position. The scapular landmarks were re-palpated and their locations recorded in the six arm positions of the modified Mallet classification. The six Mallet positions were repeated with approximately 300 markers covering the scapula. The markers formed a surface map covering the tissue over the scapula. The scapular template created in the neutral position was iteratively fit to the surface map of each trial, providing an estimate of the orientation of the scapula. These estimates of scapular orientation were compared to the known scapular orientation determined from the scapular landmarks palpated in each Mallet position. The magnitude of the largest mean difference about an anatomical axis between the two measures of scapular orientation was 3.8° with an RMS error of 5.9°. This technique is practical for populations with visibly prominent scapulae (e.g., BPBP patients), for which it is a viable alternative to existing clinical methods with comparable accuracy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Elite throwing athletes have increased proximal humeral retrotorsion (HRT) and glenoid retroversion (GRV) in their throwing shoulders compared with their nonthrowing shoulders. These adaptive morphologic changes are thought to be independently protective against shoulder injury; however, their relationship to each other is poorly understood. To determine if an association exists between HRT and GRV within the same shoulders of professional pitchers. Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. The HRT and GRV measurements were determined using published techniques in asymptomatic bilateral shoulders of 32 professional pitchers (mean age, 23 years). Three measurements for each variable were averaged, and the reliability of the techniques was verified. The relationship between HRT and GRV within the same shoulders was determined with Pearson correlation coefficients. Paired t tests were used to compare HRT and GRV between the throwing and nonthrowing shoulder. Simple ratios were calculated between HRT and GRV. Humeral retrotorsion and GRV were both significantly greater on the throwing side compared with the nonthrowing side (HRT: throwing = 9.0° ± 11.4° and nonthrowing = 22.1° ± 10.7°, P < .001; GRV: throwing = 8.6° ± 6.0° and nonthrowing = 4.9° ± 4.8°, P = .001). Within the same shoulders, there was a statistically significant positive association between HRT and GRV on the throwing side (r = 0.43, P = .016) but not on the nonthrowing side (r = -0.13, P = .50). The HRT:GRV ratio was 2.3:1 for throwing shoulders and 7:1 for nonthrowing shoulders. The concurrent increases in dominant shoulder HRT and GRV were observed as a 2:1 "thrower's ratio." As this relationship was not observed on the nondominant shoulder, it suggests that bony adaptation of the proximal humerus and glenoid are coupled during skeletal development in the throwing shoulder. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

N2  - The objective of the research was to determine the optimal location and method of attachment for accelerometer-based motion sensors, and to validate their ability to differentiate rest and increases in speed in healthy dogs moving on a treadmill. Two accelerometers were placed on a harness between the scapulae of dogs with one in a pouch and one directly attached to the harness. Two additional accelerometers were placed (pouched and not pouched) ventrally on the dog's collar. Data were recorded in 1. s epochs with dogs moving in stages lasting 3. min each on a treadmill: (1) at rest, lateral recumbency, (2) treadmill at 0% slope, 3. km/h, (3) treadmill at 0% slope, 5. km/h, (4) treadmill at 0% slope, 7. km/h, (5) treadmill at 5% slope, 5. km/h, and (6) treadmill at 5% slope, 7. km/h. Only the harness with the accelerometer in a pouch along the dorsal midline yielded statistically significant increases (P< 0.05) in vector magnitude as walking speed of the dogs increased (5-7. km/h) while on the treadmill. Statistically significant increases in vector magnitude were detected in the dogs as the walking speed increased from 5 to 7. km/h, however, changes in vector magnitude were not detected when activity intensity was increased as a result of walking up a 5% grade. Accelerometers are a valid and objective tool able to discriminate between and monitor different levels of activity in dogs in terms of speed of movement but not in energy expenditure that occurs with movement up hill. © 2011.

N2  - Background: Accurate assessment of glenoid inclination is of interest for a variety of conditions and procedures. The purpose of this study was to develop an accurate and reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on standardized anterior-posterior (AP) radiographs and on computed tomography (CT) images. Materials and methods: Three consistently identifiable angles were defined: Angle α by line AB connecting the superior and inferior glenoid tubercle (glenoid fossa) and the line identifying the scapular spine; angle β by line AB and the floor of the supraspinatus fossa; angle γ by line AB and the lateral margin of the scapula. Experimental study: these 3 angles were measured in function of the scapular position to test their resistance to rotation. Conventional AP radiographs and CT scans were acquired in extension/flexion and internal/external rotation in a range up to ±40°. Clinical study: the inter-rater reliability of all angles was assessed on AP radiographs and CT scans of 60 patients (30 with proximal humeral fractures, 30 with osteoarthritis) by 2 independent observers. Results: The experimental study showed that angle α and β have a resistance to rotation of up to ±20°. The deviation from neutral position was not more than ±10°. The results for the inter-rater reliability analyzed by Bland-Altman plots for the angle β fracture group were (mean ± standard deviation) -0.1 ± 4.2 for radiographs and -0.3 ± 3.3 for CT scans; and for the osteoarthritis group were -1.2 ± 3.8 for radiographs and -3.0 ± 3.6 for CT scans. Conclusion: Angle β is the most reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on conventional AP radiographs, providing a resistance to positional variability of the scapula and a good inter-rater reliability. © 2012 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Shoulder motion has been mainly analysed in children based on thoraco-humeral (TH) joint kinematics, excluding the scapula-thoracic (ST) and gleno-humeral (GH) joints. In order to measure 3D scapulo-humeral motion using an optoelectronic system, we propose a protocol based on an acromion marker cluster (AMC), a functional method to determine the gleno-humeral rotation centre and different Euler sequences. This study investigated the validity of the AMC compared to the palpation of anatomical landmarks with a scapula locator, assessed the intra-session repeatability and the ability to discriminate differences of such a protocol in 10 typically developing children (TD) and 10 children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP) during 6 different tasks (flexion, abduction, horizontal abduction, hand to head, hand to controlateral shoulder and hand to back pocket). For both populations, the AMC method showed an overall Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5.5°. The AMC method under-estimated the protraction/retraction of the scapula during abduction. The within-session reliability was good to excellent for all tasks except the hand to back pocket task. The YXY recommended Euler sequence for TH and GH joints resulted in gimbal lock for most of the tasks whereas the XZY sequence could be used for most of the tasks and most of the children. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Introduction. Ultrasound imaging has gained acceptance in pain management interventions. Features of myofascial pain syndrome have been explored using ultrasound imaging and elastography. There is a paucity of reports showing the benefit clinically. This report provides three-dimensional features of taut bands and highlights the advantages of using two-dimensional ultrasound imaging to improve targeting of taut bands in deeper locations. Case Report. Fifty-eight-year-old man with pain and decreased range of motion of the right shoulder was referred for further management of pain above the scapula after having failed conservative management for myofascial pain syndrome. Three-dimensional ultrasound images provided evidence of aberrancy in the architecture of the muscle fascicles around the taut bands compared to the adjacent normal muscle tissue during serial sectioning of the accrued image. On two-dimensional ultrasound imaging over the palpated taut band, areas of hyperechogenicity were visualized in the trapezius and supraspinatus muscles. Subsequently, the patient received ultrasound-guided real-time lidocaine injections to the trigger points with successful resolution of symptoms. Conclusions. This is a successful demonstration of utility of ultrasound imaging of taut bands in the management of myofascial pain syndrome. Utility of this imaging modality in myofascial pain syndrome requires further clinical validation. Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Analysis of the function of glenohumeral ligaments (GHLs) during physical joint manipulations is hindered by an inability to adequately image these tissues during the movements. This restricts functional biomechanics studies only to the manoeuvres that may be replicated cadaverically. There is, however, a clinical imperative to be able to investigate complex manoeuvres that exacerbate symptoms but cannot be easily conducted physically in the laboratory. The aim of this study was to develop and validate an algorithm for a computer simulation model that allows the quantification of glenohumeral ligament lengths during function. Datasets of the humerus and scapula pair were segmented to provide individual surface meshes of the bones and insertion points of each glenohumeral ligament on both bones. An algorithm was developed in which the glenohumeral ligament attachment-to-attachment length was divided into two straight lines, plus an arc overlaying the spherical wrapping portions. The model was validated by simulating two classical cadaveric studies from the literature and comparing results. Predictions from the model were qualitatively similar to the results of the two cadaveric studies by a factor of 91.7% and 81.8%, respectively. Algorithm application will allow investigation of functional loading of the glenohumeral ligaments during simulated complex motions. This could then be used to provide diagnostic understanding and thus, inform surgical reconstruction.

N2  - Ultrasonography (US) is a helpful imaging tool in the evaluation of the musculoskeletal system. It has some advantages over the other imaging techniques, such as plain radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, represented by the non-invasiveness and multiplanar imaging capability, repeatability, lack of radiation burden, good patient acceptance, and relatively limited costs. US offers an excellent resolution and a possibility for real-time dynamic examination of the joints and surrounding soft tissues, as well as enables monitoring of therapeutic response. The most common clinical indications for US examination of the shoulder are rotator cuff and biceps tendon pathology (tenosynovitis, tendinosis, complete and partial tears, and impingement) and disorders of other soft-tissue structures (joint recesses, bursae, muscles, suprascapular and axillary nerves) as well as bony cortex abnormalities. US is very useful for US-guided procedures (biopsy, joint and bursae aspirations and injections, aspiration and dissolution of calcific tendinosis). The aim of this article is to analyze the current literature about US of the shoulder and to describe both normal and pathological findings.

N2  - The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of a modified two-dimensional electrical inclinometer to measure scapular upward rotation during static humeral elevation. Numerous techniques have been proposed to qualitatively and quantitatively measure upward rotation of the scapula. These techniques are limited by expense or an inability to be synchronized with other measurements, such as muscle activity and force output. For validity testing, static scapular upward rotation was measured separately with a digital protractor and electrical inclinometer while participants were at rest and 60°, 90° and 120° of humeral elevation in the scapular plane. For reliability testing, either 20min before or 20min after validity testing, participants performed the testing positions while measurements were taken with the electrical inclinometer only. Significant correlations existed between the modified electrical inclinometer and digital protractor at all four positions (r>0.996, p<0.001). The electrical inclinometer demonstrated good to excellent intra-rater reliability (ICC3,1>0.892, 95%CI: 0.785-0.988 and SEM<1.8°). These results support the use of the electrical inclinometer to measure scapular upward rotation. These findings provide clinicians and researchers with a practical instrument that can accurately measure scapular upward rotation in synchrony with other measurements, such as electromyography and isokinetic data. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging plays a major role in helping to identify rotator cuff disease and in demonstrating the pathology associated with external impingement. Many surgeons rely on MR imaging to assist in decision making and presurgical planning for patients with rotator cuff pain. This article reviews the etiology of external impingement and rotator cuff tears, and describes the MR imaging appearance of the normal and the pathologic rotator cuffs. It focuses on the supraspinatus tendon because this is the tendon involved in 95% of rotator cuff tears. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Conclusions about normal and pathologic shoulder motion are frequently made from studies using skin surface markers, yet accuracy of such sensors representing humeral motion is not well known. Nineteen subjects were investigated with flock of birds electromagnetic sensors attached to transcortical pins placed into the scapula and humerus, and a thermoplastic cuff secured on the arm. Subjects completed two repetitions of raising and lowering the arm in the sagittal, scapular and coronal planes, as well as shoulder internal and external rotation with the elbow at the side and abducted to 90°. Humeral motion was recorded simultaneously from surface and bone fixed sensors. The average magnitude of error was calculated for the surface and bone fixed measurements throughout the range of motion. ANOVA tested for differences across angles of elevation, raising and lowering, and differences in body mass index. For all five motions tested, the plane of elevation rotation average absolute error ranged from 0-2°, while the humeral elevation rotation average error ranged from 0-4°. The axial rotation average absolute error was much greater, ranging from 5° during elevation motions to approaching 30° at maximum excursion of internal/external rotation motions. Average absolute error was greater in subjects with body mass index greater than 25. Surface sensors are an accurate way of measuring humeral elevation rotations and plane of elevation rotations. Conversely, there is a large amount of average error for axial rotations when using a humeral cuff to measure glenohumeral internal/external rotation as the primary motion. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: The restoration of shoulder function is a major issue in brachial plexus palsy. Although several tendon and nerve transfers have been described, shoulder arthrodesis remains a reliable technique in this context. This study planned to compare surgical and functional outcomes of 2 glenohumeral arthrodesis bone graft techniques: massive subacromial corticocancellous versus cancellous only grafts. Methods: We reviewed 54 patients who had shoulder arthrodesis according to 2 parameters after a mean follow-up of 37 months. The primary outcome measure was the rate of fusion according to the surgical technique. A total of 26 patients received a massive subacromial corticocancellous bone autograft, and 28 patients received only cancellous bone. The secondary outcome measure was the range of scapulothoracic motion measured by a video-assisted method according to type of neurological lesion. Brachial plexus palsy was complete in 32 cases and partial in 22 cases. All patients had recovered active elbow flexion before undergoing shoulder arthrodesis. Of the 54 patients, 48 had no postoperative immobilization. Results: The overall fusion rate was 76% after the first surgical procedure and 94% at last follow-up. Reoperation led to fusion in 10 cases, whereas 3 cases never fused. Pseudarthrosis rate after first surgery was 4% in the group with massive subacromial graft versus 43% in the group with cancellous bone graft. The mean range of motion was 59° in abduction (57° for complete palsy and 62° for partial palsy) with 42 cases 45° or greater. The mean range of motion was 48° in rotation (50° for complete palsy and 46° for partial palsy) with 35 cases 45° or greater. Conclusions: Shoulder fusion provided active abduction greater than 45° in more than 75% of cases and active rotation greater than 45° in almost 65% of cases. Using a massive subacromial graft significantly reduced pseudarthrosis rate (P <.001). Type of study/level of evidence: Therapeutic III. © 2012 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

N2  - Background: The optimal degree of conformity between the glenoid and humeral components in total shoulder arthroplasty for best performance and durability is still a matter of debate. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of joint conformity on the bone-implant interface micromotions in a cementless glenoid implant. Materials and methods: Polyethylene inlays with different degrees of conformity (radial mismatch of 0, 2, 4, and 6 mm) were mounted on a cementless metal back and then implanted in a bone substitute. These glenoid components were loaded by a prosthetic humeral head during a force-controlled experiment. Normal-to-interface micromotions and bone substitute deformations were measured at different points of the interface. Rim displacement and humeral head translation were also measured. A finite element (FE) model of the experiments was implemented to estimate the normal- and tangent-to-interface micromotions in the entire bone-implant interface. Results: All measured variables increased with less-conforming PE inlays. Normal-to-interface micromotions were significantly larger (P < .05) when the radial mismatch was 6 mm compared with the fully conforming inlay. The FE model was in agreement and complemented the experimental results. FE model-predicted interface micromotions were already significantly larger when the radial mismatch was equal to 4 mm. Discussion: In a force-controlled experiment with a cementless glenoid component, a non-conforming PE inlay allows larger interface micromotions than a conforming inlay, reaching a magnitude that may hamper local bone ingrowth in this type of component. This is mainly because of the larger humeral head translation that boosts the effects of the so-called rocking-horse phenomenon.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to examine the acromion marker cluster (AMC) method of measuring scapular kinematics during the arm lowering, eccentric, phase. Twenty six participants completed arm elevation and lowering in the sagittal, frontal and scapular plane. The participants held their arm at 30° increments while the orientation of the scapula was recorded using an AMC and a scapular locator (SL). There were no significant differences between the AMC and SL during the lowering phase for sagittal and scapular plane arm movements. The AMC significantly underestimated upward rotation (max RMSE = 6.0°), and significantly overestimated posterior tilt (max RMSE = 7.2°) during arm lowering in the frontal plane. The reported root mean square errors, however, were within the ranges observed during the elevation phase and reported in previous literature. The AMC therefore provides a reasonable description of scapular kinematics during the arm lowering phase. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - To measure the scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) in outpatient settings, the motion analysis protocol named ISEO (INAIL Shoulder and Elbow Outpatient protocol) was developed, based on inertial and magnetic sensors. To complete the sensor-to-segment calibration, ISEO requires the involvement of an operator for sensor placement and for positioning the patient's arm in a predefined posture. Since this can affect the measure, this study aimed at quantifying ISEO intra- and inter-operator agreement. Forty subjects were considered, together with two operators, A and B. Three measurement sessions were completed for each subject: two by A and one by B. In each session, the humerus and scapula rotations were measured during sagittal and scapular plane elevation movements. ISEO intra- and inter-operator agreement were assessed by computing, between sessions, the: (1) similarity of the scapulohumeral patterns through the Coefficient of Multiple Correlation (CMC2), both considering and excluding the difference of the initial value of the scapula rotations between two sessions (inter-session offset); (2) 95% Smallest Detectable Difference (SDD95) in scapula range of motion.Results for CMC2 showed that the intra- and inter-operator agreement is acceptable (median≥0.85, lower-whisker ≥0.75) for most of the scapula rotations, independently from the movement and the inter-session offset. The only exception is the agreement for scapula protraction-retraction and for scapula medio-lateral rotation during abduction (inter-operator), which is acceptable only if the inter-session offset is removed. SDD95 values ranged from 4.4° to 8.6° for the inter-operator and between 4.9° and 8.5° for the intra-operator agreement.In conclusion, ISEO presents a high intra- and inter-operator agreement, particularly with the scapula inter-session offset removed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..

N2  - Following stroke, control of both the contralesional (paretic) and ipsilesional (less affected) arms is altered. The purpose of this study was to analyse the consequences of stroke on joint rotations of both shoulder girdles, that is, glenohumeral (GH) and scapula motion. Because of hemispheric specialization, we hypothesized that changes would relate to the side of hemisphere damage. Nine stroke patients with left, and 9 with right hemisphere damage (LHD and RHD) and 9 healthy subjects were included. Reaching movements to targets positioned close, far and high in three directions were recorded using an electromagnetic system. Initial and final postures of the scapula, GH and elbow joint were evaluated. Inter-joint rotations throughout the movements were analysed using principal component analysis (PCA). The main finding was that initial and final postures of the contralesional and ipsilesional shoulders differed depending on the side of brain lesion. On the contralesional side, there was less scapula protraction and GH lateral rotation for both groups. Scapula tilt was less anterior in LHD patients, and GH elevation was greater in RHD patients. On the ipsilesional side, GH lateral rotation was reduced in both groups, and scapula protraction was reduced only for LHD patients. PCA confirmed that postures of both shoulders of the LHD group were substantially different to the healthy subjects, while only the contralesional arm of the RHD subjects differed. These results add to existing knowledge of hemispheric specialization, suggesting that the left hemisphere plays a greater role in bilateral joint postures than the right hemisphere. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - This study aimed to determine the effect of isometric internal and external rotation at various degrees of shoulder abduction on the acromiohumeral distance (AHD). This was a prospective study that used a within-subject repeated-measures design and randomization of independent variables. Data from 29 of 58 (40 women, 18 men) prospectively enrolled healthy subjects were used for analysis. A still ultrasound image of the right subacromial space was taken to measure the AHD for each of three contraction conditions (rest, isometric internal, and external rotation) at three shoulder positions (neutral and 30 and 45 degrees of abduction). Intrarater reliability ranged from 0.86 to 0.99. At 45 degrees of shoulder abduction, the AHD was significantly smaller with isometric external rotation when compared with no contraction (P = 0.0015) and with isometric internal rotation (P = 0.0002). The AHD was not affected by resistive isometric internal rotation of the shoulder, although it decreased with resistive isometric external rotation at 45 degrees of shoulder abduction. Resistive isometric shoulder external rotation in a position of abduction should be used with caution when the goal is to maintain the AHD. Further research is required to determine the effects of isometric contraction in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome.

N2  - With the exception of displaced articular glenoid fractures, management of scapular fractures has largely consisted of benign neglect, with an emphasis on motion as allowed by the patient's pain. Better understanding of this injury has resulted in greater acceptance of surgical management of highly displaced variants. However, little agreement exists on indications for surgery, and there is no clear comparative evidence on outcomes for surgically versus nonsurgically managed fractures. Scapular fractures are the result of high-energy mechanisms of injury, and they often occur in conjunction with other traumatic injuries. In addition to performing meticulous physical and neurologic examination, the surgeon should obtain plain radiographs, including AP shoulder, axillary, and scapular Y views. Three-dimensional CT is used to determine accurate measurements in surgical candidates. Surgical approach, technique, and timing are individualized based on fracture type and other patient-related factors.

N2  - Shoulder rehabilitation can best be understood and implemented as the practical application of biomechanical and muscle activation guidelines to the repaired anatomic structures in order to allow the most complete return to function. The shoulder works as a link in the kinetic chain of joint motions and muscle activations to produce optimum athletic function. Functional shoulder rehabilitation should start with establishment of a stable base of support and muscle facilitation in the trunk and legs, and then proceeds to the scapula and shoulder as healing is achieved and proximal control is gained. The pace of this "flow" of exercises is determined by achievement of the functional goals of each segment in the kinetic chain. In the early rehabilitation stages, the incompletely healed shoulder structures are protected by exercises that are directed towards the proximal segments. As healing proceeds, the weak scapular and shoulder muscles are facilitated in their re-activation by the use of the proximal leg and trunk muscles to re-establish normal coupled activations. Closed chain axial loading exercises form the basis for scapular and glenohumeral functional rehabilitation, as they more closely simulate normal scapula and shoulder positions, proprioceptive input, and muscle activation patterns. In the later rehabilitation stages, glenohumeral control and power production complete the return of function to the shoulder and the kinetic chain. In this integrated approach, glenohumeral emphasis is part of the entire program and is towards the end of rehabilitation, rather than being the entire program and being at the beginning of the program. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Purpose: The relationship between glenoid version angle and rotator cuff pathology has been described. However, the effect of glenoid version angle on rotator cuff pathology is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an impact of glenoid version angle on rotator cuff pathology. Methods: All shoulder MRI examinations performed in the study centres between August 2008 and August 2009 were evaluated retrospectively. Shoulder MRI examinations having rotator cuff pathology such as trauma, degeneration, and acromion type 2-3-4 reported in previous studies were excluded from the study. Sixty-two shoulder MRIs with rotator cuff pathology having type 1 acromion morphology and 60 shoulder exams without rotator cuff pathology were included in the study. Glenoid version angle was calculated in axial images. Rotator cuff was evaluated in fat-suppressed T2-weighted and proton density-weighted images. Result: The mean values for glenoid version angle were 2.41° and 0.61° in the control and the study groups, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups (p∈>∈0.05). In addition, 26.6% and 33.8% of the glenoids were retroverted and 73.4% and 66.2% were anteverted in the control and the study groups, respectively (all p∈>∈0.05). Conclusion: This study demonstrated no significant relationship between glenoid version angle and rotator cuff pathology. Therefore, the pathologies that can be related to the cuff itself should be investigated if the pathology cannot be explained by an extrinsic cause in subjects with rotator cuff pathology. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - The notching phenomenon is one of the major concerns with reversed total shoulder arthroplasty. Repetitive contact between the humeral implant and the scapula (mechanical notching) produces progressive abrasion of the implant if the moving part is made of polyethylene. Its debris may then lead to active osteolysis (biological notching). Inversion of bearing materials, i.e. Glenosphere made of polyethylene and humeral Inlay made of metal, aims at the reduction of this phenomenon. However, the question arises if the tribological behavior would then be different. On an experimental setup, the gravimetric wear of both material configurations was measured after loading and moving over 500,000 cycles. The abrasion of the polyethylene Inlay due to mechanical notching was calculated by means of 3D CAD models with different notching stages. The loss of mass due to gravimetric wear was compared to the loss of mass caused by mechanical notching. After 500,000 cycles the measured amount of wear of the polyethylene components was between 8 and 10. mg for both tribological pairings. The calculated loss of mass of the polyethylene Inlay caused by mechanical notching ranged from 73 to 3881. mg. The results of this study indicate that the gravimetric polyethylene wear in the estimated life-time is very low and not significantly different between both material configurations. However, the polyethylene abrasion due to mechanical notching in the configuration with polyethylene Inlay is by far more important than any gravimetric wear. These results support the continued use of inverted bearings in reversed total shoulder arthroplasty. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: We analysed 11 patients with malignant musculoskeletal tumours of the humerus who underwent limb salvage surgery with total humeral custom endoprosthesis from 1990 to 2009. Methods: There were six male and five female patients, with a mean age of 17 years. The most common diagnosis was osteosarcoma. The average follow-up period was 66 months, with the maximum being 180 months. Functional and oncological outcomes were analysed. Results: The one and five year cumulative survival (Kaplan-Meier method) rates were 90.9% and 77.9%. The average Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Score (MSTS) was 80%. Two patients died due to metastasis. One patient had a forequarter amputation for local recurrence. The procedure provides fast recovery and relatively good restoration of elbow function, whereas active shoulder movements remain limited Conclusion: Total humeral customendoprosthetic replacement represents a viable treatment option in indicated patients, providing reliable and reasonable function of the upper limb, with a low complication rate. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

N2  - Objective: Recent evidence suggests that shoulder impingement syndrome arises from primary rotator cuff pathology and may be related to the inability of the rotator cuff to prevent superior humeral head migration in shoulder elevation. Impingement involves compression of subacromial structures, including the rotator cuff. Previously, clinical tests have been shown to be inaccurate in diagnosing rotator cuff impingement. A lack of anatomical validity might explain the inaccuracy of these tests. This study aimed to clarify the anatomical basis of subacromial compression of the rotator cuff by analysing the compression forces generated and observing the structures impinged in a variety of shoulder positions. Design: This observational case series involved the dissection of nine embalmed cadaveric shoulders. Method: Pressure transducers were placed deep to the coracoid process, coracoacromial ligament, the anterior acromion and the posterior acromion. Shoulders were moved into internal and external rotation from the positions of flexion, abduction and extension. At each position, pressure readings were recorded and structures being compressed observed visually. Results: Highest pressures were recorded in flexion/internal rotation at the coracoacromial ligament, in abduction/internal rotation at the coracoid process (both involving the rotator interval) and in abduction/internal rotation at the coracoacromial ligament (involving supraspinatus). Supraspinatus was also observed to be compressed in extension/external rotation (against the anterior acromion). Infraspinatus was compressed in extension/external rotation (against the posterior acromion), while subscapularis was compressed in flexion/internal rotation and flexion/external rotation (both against the coracoid process). Conclusion: This study identifies shoulder positions likely to impinge particular rotator cuff tendons. © 2011 Sports Medicine Australia.

N2  - Objectives: To establish the test-retest reliability of ultrasound measurements on acromio-humeral distance (AHD) and supraspinatus tendon thickness; and to explore their relationships with shoulder rotational strengths. Design: Test-retest observational study. Methods: Thirty-seven individuals (age: 21.5. ±. 1.4 years) participated in this study. Twenty-four were University volleyball players with 15 healthy and 9 players with shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS). Thirteen participants were healthy untrained individuals. Ultrasound measurements of AHD and supraspinatus tendon thickness were taken, and isokinetic testing of concentric shoulder internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) at a speed of 90°/s was performed. Results: The measurement of the AHD and the supraspinatus tendon thickness indicated excellent reliability (ICC. =. 0.922, and ICC. =. 0.933 respectively), and the minimum detectable difference (MDD) were 2.10. mm and 0.64. mm respectively. A cut-off AHD distance of 23.9. mm had a sensitivity of 0.67 and specificity of 0.71 (area under curve (AUC): 0.70; p=. 0.05) in identifying individuals with and without SIS. Hence, individuals with AHD larger than 23.9. mm had greater possibility of having SIS. Positive correlations were found in AHD with supraspinatus tendon thickness (. r=. 0.36, p<. 0.05) and shoulder external rotational strengths (. r=. 0.47-0.62, all p<. 0.05) and ER/IR ratios (. r=. 0.56-0.58, all p<. 0.05). Conclusions: Ultrasound measurements of AHD and tendon thickness have excellent reliability. The reported cut-off AHD highlighted the potential role of ultrasound measurements in volleyball players for early identification of SIS. The AHD was related to the supraspinatus tendon thickness and shoulder external rotation strengths. Our findings provide a scientific basis for muscle training in overhead athletes such as volleyball players. © 2011 Sports Medicine Australia.

N2  - Purpose Asymmetric stress imposed on the shoulder can lead to anterior shoulder instability in young athletes who perform repetitive overhead motions. A common treatment, surgical anterior capsule tightening, assumes that the instability is caused by abnormal anterior laxity. This study investigated the possibility that one element of overall imbalance, posterior capsular tightness, could be an underlying reason for shoulder instability. Surgical navigation technology, which is more accurate than whole-body motion-capture systems, was used to study anterior translational motions. Method The study was used four cadaver shoulders, with the scapula and rotator cuff muscles intact. Opto-electronic surgical navigation localization devices were mounted on the scapula and humerus to accurately capture positions and orientations. The shoulders were passively moved through 7 motions, 5 of simple angulation and 2 combinations of clinical interest. Each motion was repeated in 4 different soft-tissue states: rotator cuff intact, capsule intact, and surgically induced capsular tightnesses of 5 and 10mm. Results The shoulders had significantly greater anterior translation when the posterior capsule was artificially tightened (p < 0.05); this was particularly in movements that combined abduction with internal or external rotation, which are typical overhead sports motions. Overall translation was indifferent to whether the shoulders were intact or dissected down to the capsule, as was translation during flexion was indifferent to dissection state (p > 0.95). Conclusion Surgical navigation technology can easily be used to analyze cadaveric shoulder motion, with opportunities for adaptation to anesthetized patients. Results suggest that the inverse of artificial tightening, such as surgical release of the posterior capsule, may be an effective minimally invasive treatment of chronic shoulder dislocation subsequent to sports motions. © CARS 2012.

N2  - Purpose of the Study The aim of the study is to remind the medical community of the occurrence of rare dorsal glenohumeral dislocations and of the need to pay increased attention to radiographic and clinical examination in the patients in whom signs of this injury are also supported by medical history. When this dislocation becomes a chronic disorder, it can frequently be managed only by surgical intervention. The treatment algorithm used at the authors' institutions is described. Material In the period from 2000 to 2008, a total of l7 patients (9 women and 8 men) with an average age of 65.5 years (51 to 89 years) had surgery for inveterated dorsal glenohumeral dislocation. The average injury-surgery interval was 5.6 weeks (1 to 18 weeks). The average follow-up was 38 months (101 to 13 months). Methods Surgery was performed via an anterior deltoideopectoral approach. Under pathological conditions, the subscapular muscle was identified. When a large reverse Hill-Sachs defect was present, the lesser tuberosity with the subscapular tendon was osteomited (10 patients). After scar and granulation tissue had been removed, the humeral head was reduced. Using Neer's modification of the McLaughlin procedure, the excised lesser tuberosity fragment was transfered into the anteromedial defect in the humeral head and fastened with a screw. In the case of an unstable humeral head, this was held in the reduced position by two Kirschner wires either passed through the acromion or fixed to the glenoid (11 patients). The arm was immobilized in a brace for four weeks. Then the wires were removed and rehabilitation was started with avoidance of internal rotation. Results None of the patients had recurrent dislocation. All were satisfied with the outcome and capable of resuming their daily activities sufficiently. Six patients complained of occasional pain. The average value of active elevation was 113° (40° to 160°). Reduced muscle strength in abduction, as compared with the contralateral arm, was observed in two patients. Injury to the axillary vein was recorded in one patient. Two patients had a large haematoma of the arm with swelling of the whole extremity. Two of the 11 patients treated with Kirschner wires developed infection around the wires that healed after their removal at four weeks after surgery. Discussion The open reduction and stabilization of a posterior inveterated glenohumeral dislocation can be regarded as a rare procedure performed only occasionally even in specialized institutions. The international literature also provides information on only a few tens of such cases over a number of years. Causal procedures, performed through both an anterior and posterior approach, as well as extrafocal (rotational) osteotomy have been recommended. Currently, surgery from an anterior approach is preferred, because a reverse Hill-Sachs defect, if present, can be managed either by transfer of the lesser tuberosity with the subscapular tendon or by massive allograft. Conclusions The authors' experience suggests that Neer's modification of the McLaughlin procedure is the optimal treatment for posterior inveterated glenohumeral dislocation with an anteromedial defect of the humeral head. The excision of the lesser tuberosity with the subscapular tendon provides good access to the shoulder joint and thus allows for its reliable reduction. The fastening of a tuberosity fragment into the compression defect resolves one of the major risks for recurrent dislocation, without necessity to use allogenic material. Transfixation of the humeral head with Kirschner wires for four weeks is a reliable method of holding the head in the glenoid without risk of significantly restricting shoulder motion in the future.

N2  - Background: The Subacromial Impingement Syndrome (SIS) is the most common diagnosed disorder of the shoulder in primary health care, but its aetiology is unclear. Conservative treatment regimes focus at reduction of subacromial inflammatory reactions or pathologic scapulohumeral motion patterns (intrinsic aetiology). Long-lasting symptoms are often treated with surgery, which is focused at enlarging the subacromial space by resection of the anterior part of the acromion (based on extrinsic aetiology). Despite that acromionplasty is in the top-10 of orthopaedic surgical procedures, there is no consensus on its indications and reported results are variable (successful in 48-90%).We hypothesize that the aetiology of SIS, i.e. an increase in subacromial pressure or decrease of subacromial space, is multi-factorial. SIS can be the consequence of pathologic scapulohumeral motion patterns leading to humerus cranialisation, anatomical variations of the scapula and the humerus (e.g. hooked acromion), a subacromial inflammatory reaction (e.g. due to overuse or micro-trauma), or adjoining pathologies (e.g. osteoarthritis in the acromion-clavicular-joint with subacromial osteophytes). We believe patients should be treated according to their predominant etiological mechanism(s). Therefore, the objective of our study is to identify and discriminate etiological mechanisms occurring in SIS patients, in order to develop tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, applied clinical and experimental methods to identify intrinsic and extrinsic etiologic mechanisms comprise: MRI-arthrography (eligibility criteria, cuff status, 3D-segmented bony contours); 3D-motion tracking (scapulohumeral rhythm, arm range of motion, dynamic subacromial volume assessment by combining the 3D bony contours and 3D-kinematics); EMG (adductor co-activation) and dynamometry instrumented shoulder radiographs during arm tasks (force and muscle activation controlled acromiohumeral translation assessments); Clinical phenotyping (Constant Score, DASH, WORC, and SF-36 scores). Discussion: By relating anatomic properties, kinematics and muscle dynamics to subacromial volume, we expect to identify one or more predominant pathophysiological mechanisms in every SIS patient. These differences in underlying mechanisms are a reflection of the variations in symptoms, clinical scores and outcomes reported in literature. More insight in these mechanisms is necessary in order to optimize future diagnostic and treatment strategies for patients with SIS symptoms.Trial Registration: Dutch Trial Registry (Nederlands Trial Register) NTR2283.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of coracoclavicular screw fixation in displaced distal clavicular fractures. Methods: Sixteen patients with Neer Type 2 displaced distal clavicle fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. Fixation was performed using a coracoclavicular screw with washer application. After union the screw was removed under local anesthesia. Radiographic evaluation was performed and the clinical outcome was assessed using the Constant score. Results: All patients achieved painless osseous unions. However, one patient showed significant displacement of the fracture due to loosening of the screw one month after surgery. The screw was removed and the fracture was healed with some deformity. All patients returned to their preinjury level in 3 months. The mean Constant score was 98. Conclusion: Coracoclavicular screw fixation in the treatment of distal clavicular fractures is a reliable, simple and cost effective technique. © 2011 Turkish Association of Orthopaedics and Traumatology.

N2  - Tendon transfers have been proposed as a possible solution to restore pain-free functions, strength, and range of motion in patients with massive and irreparable cuff tears. The aim of this review is to establish the outcomes of (1) latissimus dorsi tendon transfer (LDT-T) surgery performed as a single procedure or in combination with other muscle-tendon transfer procedures, replacement, or both; (2) LDT-T in primary and revision surgery for massive irreparable rotator cuff tears; (3) the LDT-T procedure in relation to subscapularis and teres minor integrity; (4) the LDT-T procedure in relation to the reattachment position on the humeral head of the transferred tendon; (5) the LDT-T procedure performed as a single or a double incision; (6) arthroscopic, open, or combined approach: and (7) the LDT-T procedure in patients with preoperative osteoarthritis and a nonosteoarthritic condition with the evaluation of osteoarthritis progression. A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Studies of levels of evidence I-IV were included. The LDT-T surgical procedure, outcomes, and complications were evaluated. Twenty-two studies describing 493 shoulders in 487 patients were included in our study. There were no prospective randomized, controlled studies. LDT-T is a promising strategy for the management of massive and irreparable rotator cuff tears, even though no agreement was found on several aspects and options of LDT-T. Randomized prospective control studies are still awaited on this subject. © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Hypothesis/background: Suprascapular nerve injury may be a complication during shoulder arthroscopy. Our aim was to verify the reliability of the existing data, assess the differences between scapulae in the 2 genders and in the same subject, obtain a safe zone useful to avoid iatrogenic nerve lesions, and analyze the existing correlations between the scapular dimensions and the safe zone. Methods: We examined 500 dried scapulae, measuring 6 distances for each one, referring to the scapular body, glenoid, and the course of the suprascapular nerve, also catalogued according to gender and side. Differences due to gender were assessed comparing mean ± sd of each distance in males and females; paired t test was used to compare distances deriving from each couple. Successively, we calculated our safe zone and Pearson's correlation. Results: We found nonsignificant differences between the right and left distances deriving from each couple; differences due to gender were stated. We defined 3 kinds of safe zones referring to: 500 scapulae; males (139 scapulae) and females (147 scapulae). The correlation indexes calculated between the axis of the scapular body and glenoid, and the posterosuperior distance (referring to the suprascapular nerve) were 0.624, 0.694, 0.675, 0.638; while those with the posterior distance were 0.230, 0.294, 0.232, 0.284. Discussion/conclusions: Knowledge of the safe zone, for avoiding suprascapular nerve injury, is important; gender and specific scapular dimensions should be evaluated, as they influence the dimensions of the safe zone. The linear predictors should be used to obtain specific values of the posterosuperior limit in each patient. © 2011 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Standard, beaded radiostereometric analysis (RSA) and markerless RSA often use computed tomography (CT) scans to create three-dimensional (3D) bone models. However, ethical concerns exist due to risks associated with CT radiation exposure. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of decreasing CT dosage on RSA accuracy. Four cadaveric shoulder specimens were scanned using a normal-dose CT protocol and two low-dose protocols, where the dosage was decreased by 89% and 98%. 3D computer models of the humerus and scapula were created using each CT protocol. Bi-planar fluoroscopy was used to image five different static glenohumeral positions and two dynamic glenohumeral movements, of which a total of five static and four dynamic poses were selected for analysis. For standard RSA, negligible differences were found in bead (0.21±0.31. mm) and bony landmark (2.31±1.90. mm) locations when the CT dosage was decreased by 98% (p-values>0.167). For markerless RSA kinematic results, excellent agreement was found between the normal-dose and lowest-dose protocol, with all Spearman rank correlation coefficients greater than 0.95. Average root mean squared errors of 1.04±0.68. mm and 2.42±0.81° were also found at this reduced dosage for static positions. In summary, CT dosage can be markedly reduced when performing shoulder RSA to minimize the risks of radiation exposure. Standard RSA accuracy was negligibly affected by the 98% CT dose reduction and for markerless RSA, the benefits of decreasing CT dosage to the subject outweigh the introduced errors. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background: Baseplate micromotion of the reverse shoulder glenoid component can lead to implant loosening. We hypothesized that a remotely positioned displacement gage measures elastic deformation of the system rather than actual micromotion at the implant/bone interface. Methods: Reverse glenoid components were implanted into polyurethane blocks of 3 different densities. A 700 N compressive load was maintained and a vertical 700 N shear load was applied for 1000 cycles. In addition to the typical gage measurement, a digital image analysis of micromotion at the implant/block interface using high resolution cameras was performed. The measurements were validated on human specimens. A finite element model was implemented to study the isolated effect of block deformation on baseplate displacements. Findings: With the gage, typically reported micromotions were measured. Two orders of magnitude lower micromotions were detected using interface image-based analysis. The finite element simulation showed that elastic deformation alone can cause micromotion magnitudes as measured with displacement gages. Polyurethane blocks of 20 and 15 lbs per cubic foot density best reproduced micromotions as measured on human specimens. Interpretation: We found considerably less relative micromotion at the implant/bone interface than previously assumed. Gage measurements quantify elastic deformation and not true interface micromotion. High resolution digital imaging at the implant/bone interface is strongly recommended for an accurate assessment of reverse glenoid component micromotion. Tests should further adopt 20 or 15 pcf bone test surrogates. Further studies are required to identify the failure modes encountered in vivo, and a corresponding in vitro testing methodology can then be developed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The aim of this study was to measure which three-dimensional spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters differentiate upper limb movement characteristics in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP) from those in typically developing children (TDC), during various clinically relevant tasks. We used a standardized protocol containing three reach tasks (forwards, upwards, and sideways), two reach-to-grasp tasks (with objects requiring different hand orientations), and three gross motor tasks. Spatiotemporal (movement duration, trajectory straightness, maximum velocity, and timing of maximum velocity), as well as kinematic parameters (discrete angles and waveforms of the trunk, scapula, shoulder, elbow and wrist), were compared between 20 children with HCP (age 10.9 ± 2.9. years) and 20 individually age-matched TDC (age 10.9 ± 3.0. years). Kinematic calculations followed the recommendations from the International Society of Biomechanics. Results showed that children with HCP had longer movement durations, less straight hand trajectories, and lower maximum velocities compared to the TDC. Timing of maximum velocity did not differ between both groups. The movement pathology in children with HCP was highlighted by increased trunk movements and reduced shoulder elevation during reaching and reach-to-grasp. We also measured an increased anterior tilting and protraction of the scapula in children with HCP, although differences were not significant for all tasks. Finally, compared to the TDC, children with HCP used less elbow extension and supination and more wrist flexion to execute all tasks. This study reported distinct 3D upper limb movement characteristics in children with HCP and age-matched TDC, establishing the discriminative ability of the measurement procedure. From a clinical perspective, combining spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters may facilitate the identification of the pathological movement patterns seen in children with HCP and thereby add to a well-targeted upper limb treatment planning. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background: A wide variety of articles has been released on quantitative and/or qualitative description of the scapulo-humeral rhythm (SHR). Several coexisting SHR evaluation methods work out different shoulder movements. The results are consequently heterogeneous. This study focuses on the scaption to be comparative and because of its functional and frequently used sides. Objective: Define quantitative and qualitative patterns of the SHR of active scaption and report the consequences of its influential factors. Method: Studying literature describing the SHR of the active scaption using 3D methods. Results: Three studies describe SHR of the scaption in detail. The large variability inter-individual doesn't allow a quantification of a ciphered and common pattern. There is no alternative but to compare to the opposite healthy shoulder. Qualitatively speaking, the scapulo-thoracic joint seems to never participate more than the scapulo-humeral joint as far as a complete range of motion is concerned. Conclusion: The knowledge of the pattern of the scaption and its fluctuations due to the elements which could modify it, allows to guide the rehabilitation of its SHR.

N2  - Background: Glenohumeral (GH) joint steroid injection is one of the most well-known treatments for frozen shoulder. However, the low accuracy of GH joint injections and the improvement of symptoms after subacromial (SA) steroid injections led us to design a study that compares the efficacy of a steroid injection for primary frozen shoulder according to the injection site. Materials and methods: Patients with primary frozen shoulder were randomly divided into 2 groups according to the location of the injection: a GH group of 37 for the glenohumeral joint and an SA group of 34 for the subacromial space. Injections were completed using ultrasonographic guidance. Evaluations using a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, the Constant score, and passive range of motion (ROM) were completed at 3, 6, and 12 weeks after the injection. Results: The GH group showed lower pain VAS at 3 weeks, but no statistical difference was found between the 2 groups at 6 and 12 weeks. Improvement in pain was evident at every follow-up visit compared with the preinjection evaluation. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to the Constant score or ROM at serial follow-up. Conclusions: The GH steroid injection was not superior to a SA injection for patients with primary frozen shoulder even though injection at the GH joint led to earlier pain relief compared with the SA injection. SA steroid injection along with a GH injection is an alternative modality, and the treatment should be individualized and tailored appropriately. © 2011 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - The aims were to test the intraexaminer reproducibility and report the presence of specific clinical variables of scapular dyskinesis in cases with trapezius myalgia and healthy controls, along with general health and work ability. A total of 38 cases and 23 controls were tested for scapular dyskinesis, general health, and work ability, and 19 cases and 14 controls participated in the reproducibility study. Intraexaminer reproducibility was good to excellent for 6 of 10 clinical variables (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient [ICC] 0.76-0.91; kappa 0.84-1.00), and fair to good for four variables (ICC 0.42-0.74), test for muscular weakness having the lowest ICC (0.42). Cases showed significantly larger medial border misalignment, larger lower horizontal distance of the inferior scapular angle and larger passive shoulder internal rotation, by 110% (1.02cm), 15% (1.38cm), and 8% (5.5°), respectively. Cases with the highest degree of scapular dyskinesis showed reduced work ability and general health. The present specific clinical variables on scapular dyskinesis showed satisfactory intraexaminer reproducibility. An increased standardization must be implemented to increase reproducibility of tests for muscular weakness, and the interexaminer reproducibility must be tested for all variables. Finally, scapular dyskinesis in cases with trapezius myalgia must be followed longitudinally for clinical importance.

N2  - The imaging evaluation of the rotator cuff augments the clinical evaluation. Radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging all have various roles in the assessment of the rotator cuff, which can be combined with arthrography for added detail. Furthermore, ultrasound is a very useful technique that provides functional information that is not offered by simple anatomic imaging. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - BACKGROUND:: The optimal surgical approach for acute acromioclavicular (AC) dislocations is still controversial. The purpose of this study is to analyze the outcome of anatomic repair or approximation of intra-articular and extra-articular damage. METHODS:: Fifty-six patients with Rockwood type-III, IV, and V acute AC dislocations followed up for an average of 76.6 months were evaluated. Direct repair of clavicular muscle attachments, AC joint, and repair or approximation of coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments was done. A CC of 4.5-mm cortical lag screw was used to protect the repair for 60 days. At the final follow-up, clinical assessment, radiographic analysis, function according to American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Scale, Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand score, and the ability to return to previous work were used for evaluation. RESULTS:: At the time of final follow-up, the mean values of American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, University of California-Los Angeles, and Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores were 91.3 ± 6.1, 31.5 ± 2.3, and 2.8 ± 2.1, respectively. Reduction was maintained in all but two patients, and CC distance was not statistically different from that on the healthy side. Five patients had occasional pain during daily activities and one developed AC osteoarthritis. All patients maintained their previous jobs. CONCLUSIONS:: The anatomic repair of damage in AC dislocations is a reliable treatment although it is not always feasible. Approximating torn ligaments can still produce good results under the rigid CC screw protection. Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkims.

N2  - Diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis is a clinical diagnosis based on history and physical examination. Afflicted patients exhibit active and passive loss of motion in all planes and a positive capsular stretch sign. The effect of adhesive capsulitis on acromioclavicular biomechanics leading to tenderness has not been documented in the literature. This study reports on the incidence of acromioclavicular tenderness in the presence of adhesive capsulitis. Furthermore, we note the natural history of such acromioclavicular joint pain in relation to that of adhesive capsulitis. Over a 2-year period (2005-2007), 84 patients undergoing initial evaluation for adhesive capsulitis were prospectively examined with the use of validated outcome measures and physical examination. Acromioclavicular joint tenderness results were compared and analyzed on initial evaluation and final follow-up of at least 1 year. Forty-eight patients (57%) with adhesive capsulitis had acromioclavicular joint pain on examination. At final follow-up, as range of motion improved, a significant increase in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons/Penn shoulder score and decrease in number of patients with acromioclavicular pain was noted with only 6 patients with residual pain (P<.05). In the presence of adhesive capsulitis, there is not only compensatory scapulothoracic motion but also acromioclavicular motion. This often results in transient symptoms at the acromioclavicular joint, which abate as the frozen shoulder resolves and glenohumeral motion improves. This is important to recognize to avoid unnecessary invasive treatment of the acromioclavicular joint when the patient presents with adhesive capsulitis.

N2  - Introduction: Biologic resurfacing of the glenoid has hitherto failed to adequately restore the geometry and biology of the glenoid. We hypothesised that a new concept for a press-fit osteochondral allograft glenoid replacement would restore the anatomic geometry of the glenoid, with primary stability guaranteed by the construct through press-fit fixation alone. Material and methods: Five sawbone models of human scapulae and 5 models using sheep scapulae were prepared for testing of 3 different interface designs (cross, rectangle, and dovetail). Micromotion at the graft interface was assessed in response to 1000 cycles of 30 N shear and 100 N compressive load, and maximal craniocaudal force was determined under 500 N compressive load. Results: In sawbones, mean (range) micromotion ranged from 38 (13-88) μm for cross to 208 (89-335) μm for rectangle, and decreased to 29 (21-57) μm for cross to 104 (34-127) μm for rectangle after 1000 cycles of applied shear force. In sheep bone, the mean (range) of micromotion was 15 (9-22) μm for dovetail to 51 (10-503) μm for cross and decreased to 15 (10-20) μm for dovetail to 44 (24-199) μm for cross; after 1000 cycles with the rectangle design, it decreased from 32 (25-217) μm to 16 (9-143) μm. Discussion: Despite biomechanical differences, in vitro allograft stability was generally adequate for all tested designs, particularly after the graft was allowed to "seat" by repetitive loading. While various geometries are potentially candidates for press-fitting a glenoid allograft to a host scapula, a rectangular interface between graft and host provided a favorable combination of both technical feasibility and biomechanical reliability. Conclusion: The concept of an osteochondral glenoid allograft for glenoid reconstruction is technically feasible and demonstrates adequate primary stability in vitro. © 2011 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - The aim of this study was to establish the optimal methodology for skin-fixed measurement of the scapula during dynamic movement. This was achieved by comparing an optimally positioned Scapula Tracker device (ST) to a previously described palpation device, taken as the true measure of scapular kinematics. These measurements were compared across a range of calibration positions, including the use of multiple calibration positions for a single movement, in order to establish an optimal calibration approach. Ten subjects' scapular motion was measured using this ST and a previously described Acromial Method (AM). The two datasets were compared at a standard, an optimal and a 'multiple' calibration position, thus allowing a direct comparison between two common skin-fixed methods to track the bony kinematics of the scapula across different calibration positions. A comparison was also made with a bone-fixed technique from the literature. At both the standard and optimal calibration positions the ST was shown to be the more accurate measure of internal rotation and posterior tilt, particularly above 100° of humerothoracic elevation. The ST errors were found to be acceptable in relation to clinically important levels. Calibration positions have been shown to have a significant effect on the errors of both skin-fixed measurement techniques and therefore the importance of correct calibration is highlighted. It has thus been shown that a ST can be used to accurately quantify scapular motion when appropriately calibrated for the range of motion being measured. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Although flexion is a common component of the routine clinical assessment of the shoulder the muscle recruitment patterns during this movement are not clearly understood making valid interpretation of potential muscle dysfunction problematic. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively examine shoulder muscle activity during flexion in order to compare the activity levels and recruitment patterns of shoulder flexor, scapular lateral rotator and rotator cuff muscles. Electromyographic (EMG) data were recorded from 12 shoulder muscles sites in 15 volunteers. Flexion was performed in standing in the sagittal plane at no load, 20%, and 60% of each subject's maximum load. EMG data were normalized to maximum values obtained during maximum voluntary contractions. Results indicated that anterior deltoid, pectoralis major, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, serratus anterior, upper, and lower trapezius were activated at similar moderate levels. However, subscapularis was activated at low levels and significantly lower than supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Similar activity patterns across time were demonstrated in the muscles that produce flexion torque, laterally rotate the scapula, as well as supraspinatus and infraspinatus, and did not change as flexion load increased. The onset of activity in supraspinatus and anterior deltoid occurred at the same time and prior to movement of the limb at all loads with infraspinatus activity also occurring prior to movement onset at the medium and high load conditions only. Posterior rotator cuff muscles appear to be counterbalancing anterior translational forces produced during flexion and it would appear that supraspinatus is one of the muscles that consistently "initiates" flexion. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Motion of human trunk segments in healthy subjects during activities of daily living has been described either with oversimplified models or with cumbersome techniques of isolated anatomical complex. This study describes multi-segmental trunk motion based on a new technique which is a compromise between technical limitations, implied with the experiments, and clinical relevance. Methods: The thorax segment was tracked by the optimal spatial matching of four thoracic markers. The separate bi-dimensional shoulder line rotations and translations with respect to the thorax were calculated by markers on the two acromions. Spine motion was characterised by a 5-link-segment model from additional four skin markers, in the anatomical reference frame based on four pelvic spine markers. These 14 markers were tracked in 10 healthy subjects and one clinical case during static upright posture, chair rising-sitting, step up-and-down and level walking, and also during elementary flexion and extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation movements of the entire trunk. Findings: Intra-subject repeatability over ten repetitions was found to be high for most of the measurements, with average standard deviations of less than 1.8° for all planar rotations at the spine, and less smaller than 1 mm for shoulder translations. Large motion, albeit with different patterns, was found in all subjects, also revealing interesting couplings over the three anatomical planes. Interpretation: Considerable subject-specific motion occurs at each of these different trunk segments in all three anatomical planes, in simple exercises and in motor tasks of daily living. Measurements taken with the present new trunk model in pathological subjects shall reveal corresponding patterns and ranges of motion in abnormal conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: The scapula locator method has associated intra-observer and inter-observer errors caused by the dependency on the observer to locate the scapular landmarks. The potential effect of the pressures applied by the observer on the measured scapular kinematics when this method is used has also been overlooked so far. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of using feedback on the pressures applied on the scapula using the locator on the intra-observer and inter-observer reliabilities of the method as well as on the kinematics obtained using this method. Methods: Three observers tracked the scapular motion of the dominant shoulder of each subject using the locator with no reference to pressure-feedback for three trials of bilateral elevation in the scapular plane and using the locator with pressure-feedback for three other trials. Variations between the measurements obtained were used to calculate the intra-observer errors and variations between the measurements obtained by the three observers for the same subject were used to calculate inter-observer errors. Repeated-measures ANOVA tests were used to look at differences between the two methods in terms of intra-observer and inter-observer errors and scapular kinematics. Findings: Using pressure-feedback reduced the intra-observer errors but had no effect on the inter-observer errors. Different scapular kinematics was measured using the two methods. Interpretations: Pressure-feedback improves the reliability of the scapula locator method. Differences in the scapular kinematics suggest that unregulated pressures have an effect on the physiological scapular motion. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Shoulder dislocation is an injury with potential long-term consequences that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Patient positioning and imperfect radiographic views may result in discomfort, added examination time, and problematic diagnosis. The scapular Y radiograph has been shown to be useful in diagnosing shoulder dislocation but is not considered sufficient in isolation. Using a synthetic bone shoulder model, we propose a novel technique wherein osseous landmarks are used to form angles that significantly improved diagnostic accuracy for shoulder dislocation, even in significantly rotated and otherwise indeterminate scapular Y radiographs. The glenohumeral joint is the most mobile, but the least stable, joint in the body. It relies solely on static and dynamic soft tissue restraints for stability. 1 This lack of bony constraints makes the shoulder susceptible to instability and dislocation, with nearly 70,000 shoulder dislocations presenting to emergency rooms annually in the United States. 2 These visits result in innumerable and frequently uninterpretable radiographs generally consisting of anteroposterior (AP), axillary lateral, and scapular Y views. A myriad of special views are useful for identifying specific bony lesions of the humerus or glenoid associated with dislocation. Despite its frequency, radiographic examination of the dislocated shoulder can be problematic. Patient positioning and imperfect radiographic views may result in discomfort, added examination time, and difficulty in diagnosis. Although radiographically derived measurements are common adjuncts in the diagnosis of many other musculoskeletal problems, these are not standard for the shoulder. Shoulder dislocation has long-term consequences, and prompt accurate diagnosis is paramount. 3 The scapular Y radiograph has been shown to be useful in diagnosing shoulder dislocation but is generally not considered sufficient for the diagnosis in isolation. 4 Using a synthetic bone model, this article describes a novel technique defining shoulder location based on the following bony landmarks (Figure ): the center of the acromioclavicular joint (AC), the center of the humeral head (H), the posterolateral corner of the acromion process (A), and the tip of the coracoid process (C). The landmarks form the AC-C-H and AC-A-H angles (Figure). These angles, when used, significantly improve diagnostic accuracy, even in the setting of otherwise indeterminate radiographs.

N2  - The acromial tracker is used to measure scapular rotations during dynamic movements. The method has low accuracy in high elevations and is sensitive to its attachment location on the acromion. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the attachment position and shoulder orientation during calibration on the tracker accuracy. The tracker was attached to one of three positions: near the anterior edge of the acromion process, just above the acromial angle and the meeting point between the acromion and the scapular spine. The scapula locator was used to track the scapula during bilateral abduction simultaneously. The locator was used to calibrate the tracker at: no abduction, 30°, 60°, 90° and 120° humerothoracic abduction. ANOVA tests compared RMS errors for different attachment positions and calibration angles. The results showed that attaching the device at the meeting point between the acromion and the scapular spine gave the smallest errors and it was best to calibrate the device at 60° for elevations ≤90°, at 120° for elevations >90° and at 90°or 120° for the full range of abduction. The accuracy of the tracker is significantly improved if attached appropriately and calibrated for the range of movement being measured. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: The scapular muscular system is the major determinant of scapular positioning. In addition, strength and muscular endurance develops from childhood through adolescence. It is not known whether differences in scapular positioning and motor control between adults and children may exist. Methods: Ninety-two shoulders of 46 adults (mean = 39.4; 18-86 years; SD = 22.5), and 116 shoulders of 59 children (mean = 11.6; 6-17 years; SD = 3.5), were included in the study. Scapular positioning data were collected using a clinical assessment protocol including visual observation of titling and winging, measurement of forward shoulder posture, measurement of scapular upward rotation, and the Kinetic Medial Rotation Test (KMRT). Results: The observation protocol for scapular winging and tilting did not show significant differences between adults and children. After controlling for height, forward shoulder posture (relaxed (0.28 cm/cm (0.06) vs. 0.31 cm/cm (0.07) and retracted (0.15 cm/cm (0.05) vs. 0.20 cm/cm (0.06)) were significantly smaller in children than in adults (P < 0.01). In addition, children showed greater scapular upward rotation (18.6°; SD 9.6°) than adults (14.5°; SD 10.9°) at 90° shoulder abduction. No significant differences were seen between children (19% positive test) and adults (24% positive test) using the KMRT. Conclusion: Children and adults show significant but small differences in scapular upward rotation and forward shoulder posture. These data provide useful reference values using a clinical protocol. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - This study describes the reliability of a protocol for upper limb three-dimensional movement analysis (UL-3DMA) in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP). The UL-3DMA is based on the ISB-recommendations, and contains a set of functional and clinically relevant tasks. Tasks were selected to reflect the characteristic movement deficits seen in children with HCP. The protocol consists of three reach tasks (forwards, upwards, sideways); two reach-to-grasp tasks (with objects requiring different hand orientations); and three gross motor tasks. Within and between session reliability was tested in a group of 12 children with HCP, aged 6-15 years. Reliability of movement duration/speed and joint angles at endpoint was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient; similarity of the waveforms with the coefficient of multiple correlation. Measurement errors were calculated for all parameters. Results indicated good within and between session reliability for movement duration/speed. Trunk, scapula, shoulder, elbow and wrist angles at endpoint generally showed moderately high to very high reliability. High levels of reliability were also found for scapula, shoulder and elbow waveforms and lower levels for the wrist and trunk. Within and between session measurement errors were below 5° and 7°, respectively, for most kinematic parameters. Joint angles in the transverse plane, as well as wrist flexion generally showed higher between session errors (7-10°).This study indicates that the proposed protocol is a reliable tool to quantify upper limb movements in children with HCP, providing a sound base for its clinical application. Further research is needed to establish the discriminative ability of the UL-3DMA. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Hypothesis: Glenoid erosion and medial migration of the humeral head prosthesis have been observed after most types of shoulder arthroplasty. A method of measuring the change in humeral head position with time after shoulder prosthetic arthroplasty was applied it to 14 shoulders that underwent humeral hemiarthroplasty with concentric glenoid reaming. We hypothesized that the measurement technique would be reproducible and that the rate of wear would be small in the series of shoulders studied. Materials and methods: Standardized anteroposterior and axillary radiographs were obtained after surgery. Two examiners measured the position of the humeral head center in relation to scapular reference coordinates for the anteroposterior and axillary projections and plotted these values against time after surgery. The change in position was characterized as the slope of this plot. Shoulders were included if there were at least 3 sets of postoperative films, the last being at least 2 years after surgery. Results: The slopes measured by the 2 examiners agreed within 0.5 mm/y for the anteroposterior and the axillary projections. For the series of shoulder arthroplasties, the rate of movement of the head center toward the scapula was less than 0.4 mm/y for either examiner in either projection. Discussion: Medial migration is a concern after any type of shoulder arthroplasty, whether a hemiarthroplasty, a biological interpositional arthroplasty, or a total shoulder arthroplasty. Quantifying the rate of medial migration over time after shoulder arthroplasty is an important element of clinical follow-up. Conclusions: This is an inexpensive, practical, and reproducible method that can be used to determine the rate of medial migration of the humeral head on plain radiographs after shoulder arthroplasty. The average rate of medial migration in the shoulders in this study was small. © 2011.

N2  - Study Design. Retrospective cohort study. Objective. To evaluate the internal consistency, construct validity and test-retest reliability of the Symptom Intensity Rating Scale (SIRS) in a clinical sample of people with cervical spine dysfunction. Summary of Background Data. The SIRS was developed by experienced clinicians at the Melbourne Whiplash Centre as an assessment tool and outcome measure for people with cervical spine dysfunction. The 12-item scale rates the severity of neck, shoulder shoulder blade and arm pain, neck and arm weakness, headaches dizziness nausea neck stiffness, pins and needles, and numbness. Methods. Internal consistency was explored by itemitem and corrected item-total correlations, Cronbach alpha, and Principle Components analysis. Construct validity was examined by correlation of SIRS scores with Neck Disability Index (NDI) scores, and with cervical range of motion (ROM). Test-retest reliability was determined by examining a subset of patients with NDI scores that changed by less than 10% points. Results. A dataset of 397 cases was analyzed. Missing data for the SIRS was very low. Item intercorrelations ranged from weak (<0.3) to moderate (>0.6). Corrected item-total correlations ranged from 0.35 to 0.63. Cronbach alpha was 0.85. Principle Components Analysis identified 2 correlated subscales. SIRS total scores were correlated with NDI scores at initial (r = 0.574) and final (r = 0.757) assessment. Correlations between initial SIRS scores and ROM were absent or weak, and correlations between final SIRS and ROM were stronger. Test-retest reliability Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (2,1) of the SIRS for a subset of 65 cases with unchanged NDI scores was 0.858 (95% CI 0.766-0.913). The standard error of measurement was 8 points and the Minimum Detectable Change (90% confidence) 18.7 points. Conclusion. The SIRS is a sufficiently reliable, internally consistent scale that can be used to make valid inferences about symptom severity in ambulatory patients with cervical spine dysfunction.

N2  - The most recent non-invasive methods for the recording of scapular motion are based on an acromion marker (AM) set and a single calibration (SC) of the scapula in a resting position. However, this method fails to accurately measure scapular kinematics above 90° of arm elevation, due to soft tissue artifacts of the skin and muscles covering the acromion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy, and inter-trial and inter-session repeatability of a double calibration method (DC) in comparison with SC. The SC and DC data were measured with an optoelectronic system during arm flexion and abduction at different angles of elevation (0-180°). They were compared with palpation of the scapula using a scapula locator. DC data was not significantly different from palpation for 5/6 axes of rotation tested (. Y, . X, and . Z in abduction and flexion), where as SC showed significant differences for 5/6 axes. The root mean square errors ranged from 2.96° to 4.48° for DC and from 6° to 9.19° for SC. The inter-trial repeatability was good to excellent for SC and DC. The inter-session repeatability was moderate to excellent for SC and moderate to good for DC. Coupling AM and DC is an easy-to-use method, which yields accurate and reliable measurements of scapular kinematics for the complete range of arm motion. It can be applied to the measurement of shoulder motion in many fields (sports, orthopaedics, and rehabilitation), especially when large ranges of arm motion are required. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Measuring the motion of the scapula and humerus with sub-millimeter levels of accuracy in six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) is a challenging problem. The current methods to measure shoulder joint motion via the skin do not produce clinically significant levels of accuracy. Thus, the purpose of this study was to validate a non-invasive markerless dual fluoroscopic imaging system (DFIS) model-based tracking technique for measuring dynamic in-vivo shoulder kinematics. Our DFIS tracks the positions of bones based on their projected silhouettes to contours on recorded pairs of fluoroscopic images. For this study, we compared markerlessly tracking the bones of the scapula and humerus to track them with implanted titanium spheres using a radiostereometric analysis (RSA) while manually manipulating a cadaver specimen's arms. Additionally, we report the repeatability of the DFIS to track the scapula and humerus during dynamic shoulder motion. The difference between the markerless model-based tracking technique and the RSA was ±0.3. mm in translation and ±0.5° in rotation. Furthermore, the repeatability of the markerless DFIS model-based tracking technique for the scapula and humerus was ±0.2. mm and ±0.4°, respectively. The model-based tracking technique achieves an accuracy that is similar to an invasive RSA tracking technique and is highly suited for non-invasively studying the in-vivo motion of the shoulder. This technique could be used to investigate the scapular and humeral biomechanics in both healthy individuals and in patients with various pathologies under a variety of dynamic shoulder motions encountered during the activities of daily living. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Abnormal scapular movement is widely believed to be an important factor in clinical pathology of the shoulder joint complex. Validated non-invasive techniques for measuring scapular movement have been developed, but the effect of marker placement on accuracy is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy and reliability of different groupings of markers to achieve the best accuracy and reliability for measuring scapular kinematics. Eight healthy young adult subjects were recruited. An optoelectronic marker grid was applied to the skin overlying the scapula. Two bone pins with optoelectronic marker carriers were inserted into the scapula. The accuracy of six surface marker configurations was determined by comparing the measured kinematics with scapular bone pins (the gold standard). Four humeral movements were tested: glenohumeral abduction, glenohumeral horizontal adduction, hand behind back, and forward reaching. All three rotations had a significant difference in the accuracy of the patches (p = 0.04 to p < 0.0001). For posterior tipping there was a significant effect of movement (p = 0.003) and a significant interaction (p < 0.0001). There was also a significant interaction for external rotation (p = 0.001). The marker grouping with the largest cranio-caudal spread had the highest accuracy for measuring posterior tilting (RMS 1.9°). Markers closer to the scapular spine were more accurate for tracking external rotation (RMS 2.0°) while an intermediate grouping of markers were most accurate for quantifying upward rotation (RMS 1.9°). The reliability between days ranged between 3.8° and 7.5° (based on RMS difference between trials) and there was a significant interaction between patch and movement (p < 0.0001). Intraclass correlation coefficients show moderate to good agreement for most arm movements and scapular rotations. Thus, there exists distinct optimal configurations of non-invasive marker locations for accurately measuring scapular kinematics.

N2  - Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) indicates a 20° or greater loss of internal rotation of the throwing shoulder compared with the nondominant shoulder. To determine whether GIRD and a deficit in total rotational motion (external rotation + internal rotation) compared with the nonthrowing shoulder correlate with shoulder injuries in professional baseball pitchers. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Over 3 competitive seasons (2005 to 2007), passive range of motion measurements were evaluated on the dominant and nondominant shoulders for 170 pitcher-seasons. This included 122 professional pitchers during the 3 seasons of data collection, in which some pitchers were measured during multiple seasons. Ranges of motion were measured with a bubble goniometer during the preseason, by the same examiner each year. External and internal rotation of the glenohumeral joint was assessed with the participant supine and the arm abducted 90° in the plane of the scapula, with the scapula stabilized anteriorly at the coracoid process. The reproducibility of the test methods had an intraclass correlation coefficient of .81. Days in which the player was unable to participate because of injury or surgery were recorded during the season by the medical staff of the team and defined as an injury. Pitchers with GIRD (n = 40) were nearly twice as likely to be injured as those without but without statistical significance (P = .17). Pitchers with total rotational motion deficit greater than 5° had a higher rate of injury. Minor league pitchers were more likely than major league pitchers to be injured. However, when players were injured, major league pitchers missed a significantly greater number of games than minor league pitchers. Compared with pitchers without GIRD, pitchers with GIRD appear to be at a higher risk for injury and shoulder surgery.

N2  - This study proposed a child-friendly measurement procedure for the three-dimensional analysis of upper limb movements, based on a comprehensive movement protocol. Within and between session reliability was tested in a group of 10 typically developing children (TDC) (mean age 10.3 ± 3.2. years). The movement protocol was constructed for children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP) and contained three reach tasks (forwards, upwards, sideways), three reach-to-grasp tasks (with objects requiring different hand orientations) and three gross motor tasks. Upper limb kinematics were calculated following the ISB-guidelines. Reliability of movement duration/speed and endpoint joint angles was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient; similarity of the waveforms with the coefficient of multiple correlation; measurement errors were also calculated.Reliability coefficients were generally high for movement duration/speed and most kinematic parameters. Endpoint angles for scapular tilting, shoulder elevation plane and elevation, elbow flexion-extension and wrist ulnar-radial deviation showed highest reliability. Angular waveforms were best repeated for scapular medio-lateral rotation and pro-retraction, shoulder elevation plane and elevation, and elbow flexion-extension. Results also seemed task-dependent.This study indicated that the proposed procedure could be used reliably to quantify upper limb movements in TDC. However, to compose proper age-related standards for the different tasks, larger study samples are needed. This will also help with a well-founded task-selection depending on the joints of interest. Finally, further research will need to establish the reliability in children with HCP. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Optoelectronic tracking systems are rarely used in 3D studies examining shoulder movements including the scapula. Among the reasons is the important slippage of skin markers with respect to scapula. Methods using electromagnetic tracking devices are validated and frequently applied. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a new method for in vivo optoelectronic scapular capture dealing with the accepted accuracy issues of validated methods. Eleven arm positions in three anatomical planes were examined using five subjects in static mode. The method was based on local optimisation, and recalculation procedures were made using a set of five scapular surface markers. The scapular rotations derived from the recalculation-based method yielded RMS errors comparable with the frequently used electromagnetic scapular methods (RMS up to 12.6° for 150° arm elevation). The results indicate that the present method can be used under careful considerations for 3D kinematical studies examining different shoulder movements. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

We present a method for pulsed mode radiofrequency (PRF) lesioning of the suprascapular nerve using ultrasound guidance in patients with severe pain from frozen shoulder. Design. Patients with frozen shoulder were treated by using real-time, high-resolution ultrasound guidance to facilitate PRF lesioning of the suprascapular nerve. Setting and Patients. Two patients with frozen shoulder of a tertiary hospital were reported. Measures. Pain intensity and shoulder movement before and after procedure were recorded. Results. In the two cases presented, both patients experienced pain relief and increased shoulder flexibility for 5-6 months. Conclusion. Ultrasound can not only quickly and effectively identify the suprascapular notch and nerve, but also helps the operator manipulate and advance the needle to a more precise position. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Subacromial impingement syndrome (SAIS), which is associated with pain and a loss of function, has a high occurrence in the physically active population. Not all patients respond positively to treatment. Classifying patients can improve decision-making. The scapular kinematic and clinical impairments can aid in classifying the patients who are more likely to respond to physical therapy treatment. Thirty-three subjects (males, 20-33 years) presenting SAIS were studied to determine altered scapular kinematics and clinical impairments. Three measurements were collected: (1) three-dimensional scapular kinematics during performing functional tasks; (2) impairment outcomes of range of motion and muscle force; and (3) self-reported measurements of pain, satisfaction, and function. All patients received 6-week (2 times per week) physical therapy treatment. Improvement with treatment was determined using the Global Rating of Change Scale. Scapular kinematics and clinical impairments were first identified by t-test in predicting improvement and then combined into a multivariate prediction method. A prediction method with three variables (Flexilevel Scale of Shoulder Function score < 41, muscle power of serratus anterior < 27.4% body weight, degree of scapular internal rotation at 30° shoulder elevation during descending arm phase in unloaded condition < 0.7°) were identified. It appears that scapular kinematics and impairment features can be used to classify subjects with SAIS in addition to self-report. Prospective validation of the proposed prediction method requires further investigation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background: Trunk lean over the stance limb during gait has been linked to a reduction in the knee adduction moment, which is associated with joint loading. We examined differences in knee adduction moments and frontal plane trunk lean during gait between subjects with knee osteoarthritis and a control group of healthy adults. Methods: Gait analysis was performed on 80 subjects (40 osteoarthritis). To define lateral trunk lean two definitions were used. The line connecting the midpoint between two reference points on the pelvis and the midpoint between the acromion processes was projected onto the lab frontal plane and the pelvis frontal plane. Pelvic tilt was also measured in the frontal plane as the angle between the pelvic and lab coordinate systems. Angles were calculated across the stance phase of gait. We analyzed the data, (i) by extracting discrete parameters (mean and peak) waveform values, and (ii) using principal component analysis to extract shape and magnitude differences between the waveforms. Findings: Osteoarthritis subjects had a higher knee adduction moment than the control group (α = 0.05). Although the discrete parameters for trunk lean did not show differences between groups, principal component analysis did detect characteristic waveform differences between the control and osteoarthritis groups. Interpretation: A thorough biomechanical analysis revealed small differences in the pattern of motion of the pelvis and the trunk between subjects with knee osteoarthritis and control subjects; however these differences were only detectable using principal component analysis. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Purpose To evaluate the reproducibility and safety of a novel arthroscopic technique combining a Bristow-Latarjet procedure with a Bankart repair and to report the early clinical and radiologic results. Methods Forty-seven consecutive patients with glenoid bone loss and capsular deficiency were treated with this all-arthroscopic technique; six patients had a failed arthroscopic capsulolabral repair. The coracoid fragment was osteotomized, passed with the conjoined tendon through the subscapularis muscle, and fixed in the standing position with a cannulated screw on the abraded glenoid neck. The capsule and labrum were then reattached on the glenoid rim, leaving the coracoid bone block in an extra-articular position. Potential intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded. All patients were reviewed and had postoperative radiographs; 35 had computed tomography scans. Results The procedure was performed entirely arthroscopically in 41 of 47 patients (88%); a conversion to open surgery was needed in 6 patients (12%). The axillary nerve was identified in all cases, and no neurologic injuries were observed. No patient had any recurrence of instability at the most recent follow-up (mean, 16 months). The mean Rowe score was 88 ± 16.7, and the mean Walch-Duplay score was 87.6 ± 12.9. The Subjective Shoulder Value was 87.5% ± 12.7%. The bone block was subequatorial in 98% of the cases (46 of 47) and flush to the glenoid surface in 92% (43 of 47); it was too lateral in 1 (2%) and too medial (>5 mm) in 3 (6%). There was 1 bone block fracture and 7 migrations. Conclusions The arthroscopic Bristow-Latarjet-Bankart procedure is reproducible and safe. This procedure allows restoration of shoulder stability in patients with glenoid bone loss and capsular deficiency, as well as in the case of failed capsulolabral repair. Arthroscopy offers the advantage of providing adequate visualization of both the glenohumeral joint and the anterior neck of the scapula, allowing accurate placement of the bone block and screw. Surgeons should be aware that the procedure is technically difficult and potentially dangerous because of the proximity of the brachial plexus and axillary vessels. Training on cadaveric specimens and transition from open to mini-open and, finally, to all arthroscopic is recommended.

N2  - Reasons for performing study: The function of the forelimb is fundamental to understanding both sound and pathological locomotion. The precise movements of the equine shoulder are hidden by layers of skin and muscle and hence the shoulder is normally modelled as a simple pivot during locomotion which assumes that any translational motion is negligible.Objectives: To record and quantify the sliding motion of the scapula during locomotion, using a novel imaging technique. Methods: Scapula motion during locomotion in the horse was calculated by tracking the ripple of the shoulder blade's movement under an array of markers placed over the soft tissue. Results: Interstride variability was low. Sliding of up to 80 mm in the plane of progression (cranio-caudal) was observed; however, the limits of motion varied by <5 mm in the gaits examined, despite variations in stride length. Stride length appeared to be increased by scapula rotation in the plane of progression, and this flexion-extension was largest in trot and was not significantly different between walk and canter. This was in agreement with the distance travelled by the trunk whilst the hoof was on the ground. Substantial sliding in a dorsal-ventral direction was shown and varied with the gait used, both in magnitude and timing, possibly providing a shock absorption mechanism. The sliding did not increase as much as would be expected in canter and this coincided with a more lateral positioning of the scapula and increased impact on the ribcage.Conclusions: It has been assumed that scapula-thoracic sliding increases stride length and hence economically increases locomotor speed. The extra motion of the scapula recorded appeared to absorb shock from forelimb impact and maintain the economy of locomotion, but did not increase with speed and the muscular pretensioning implied could actually impair ventilation. © 2010 EVJ Ltd.

N2  - Shoulder pain is a frequent clinical problem facing primary care physicians. Despite its common occurrence, many clinicians are unfamiliar with the diagnosis and treatment of many common shoulder ailments. Because therapy for most shoulder disorders can be made at the initial consultation, a good history and physical remain paramount. The purpose of this paper is to review the basic approach to diagnosis and management of shoulder pain. It will summarize a pragmatic approach to the initial history, with particular attention to differentiating extrinsic and intrinsic etiologies. Physical exam techniques for evaluating shoulder pain will be reviewed, including provocation testing for specific disorders. Specific disorders covered include supraspinatus tendonitis, subdeltoid bursitis, frozen shoulder, biceps tendonitis, and acromioclavicular (AC) joint arthritis.

N2  - Background: Reported healing rates of a subscapularis tenotomy have been extremely variable in the literature. The purpose of this study was to document the subscapularis healing rate after subscapularis tenotomy using ultrasound, and to correlate healing with physical examination findings and shoulder internal rotation strength. Methods: Fifteen patients who underwent total shoulder arthroplasty due to unilateral osteoarthritis were evaluated after a minimum of 6 months follow-up with ultrasound, physical examination, and internal rotation strength testing. At surgery, a subscapularis tenotomy utilized to approach the shoulder. Postoperatively, no formal physical therapy program was utilized. Results: Seven of the 15 shoulders had a complete tear of the repaired subscapularis tendon based on ultrasound examination. The lift-off and abdominal compression tests correlated poorly with the ultrasonographic condition of the subscapularis. The bear hug test using dynamometry did correlate with tendon integrity. Patients with a subscapularis tear after arthroplasty experienced significant weakness in isometric (P = .01) and isokinetic (P < .01) internal rotation strength testing, as well as significantly worse DASH scores (P = .04). No patient demonstrated anterior subluxation on examination or by radiograph. Conclusion: Subscapularis tear after total shoulder arthroplasty is a common finding, which cannot be diagnosed reliably by physical examination or radiographs. In this population, subscapularis integrity did not correlate with pain or subjective patient outcome. Failure to heal the subscapularis tenotomy is probably more common than has been previously reported based on only physical examination testing. © 2010 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Background: Because the human shoulder has many degrees of freedom that allow redundant means of producing the same net humerothoracic motion, there are many impediments to objective, repeatable assessment of shoulder function in vivo. Devices designed to date have suffered from poor reliability. In this study we introduce a new device and methods to evaluate human shoulder kinematics and evaluate its reproducibility from subject to subject and from day to day. Methods: This was a controlled laboratory study. Using electromagnetic motion sensors to record the position and orientation of the thorax, scapula, and humerus, we quantified the kinematic response of twenty four normal shoulders in response to known internal-external torque application. A four-parameter logistic function was selected to characterize the strident features of the torque-rotation relationship. Findings: Our analysis in conjunction with the measurement technique described herein, allowed the passive glenohumeral internal-external range of motion to be differentiated from other motion components and was determined to within 9.6% of full scale over three repeated trials. Range of motion was the most reliable biomechanical outcome, more so than computed indices of glenohumeral flexibility and hysteresis. The exact profile of the torque-rotation response, and therefore the repeatability of the calculated outcomes, was unique from shoulder to shoulder. Interpretation: The development of the capacity for precise, non-invasive measurement of shoulder biomechanics over time is a requisite step towards optimizing treatment of shoulder injury and disease. Our current methods are superior to previous attempts at trying to non-invasively evaluate the biomechanics of the glenohumeral joint. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint is one of the most common shoulder problems in general orthopaedic practice. The question of whether surgery should be used remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative effects of surgical versus conservative (non-surgical) interventions for treating acromioclavicular dislocations in adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to February 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2009), EMBASE (1988 to February 2009), and LILACS (1982 to February 2009), trial registries and reference lists of articles. There were no restrictions based on language or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared surgical with conservative treatment of acromioclavicular dislocation in adults were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All review authors independently performed study selection. Two authors independently assessed the included trials and performed data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials were included in this review. These involved a total of 174 mainly male participants. Two trials were randomised and one was quasi-randomised. None used validated measures for assessing functional outcome.Fixation of the acromioclavicular joint using coracoclavicular screws, acromioclavicular pins or, usually threaded, wires was compared with supporting the arm in a sling or similar device. There were no significant differences between the two groups in unsatisfactory longer-term (one year) shoulder function based on a composite measure including pain, movement and strength or function (risk ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 0.75 to 2.95), nor in treatment failure that generally required an operation (risk ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 4.12). However, there were fixation failures in all three trials. Particularly, the trial using wires reported a high incidence of wire breakage (16/39 (41%)). Two trials reported that surgery significantly delayed the return to work. The methods used in the three trials also meant a routine second operation for implant removal was necessary. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine when surgical treatment is indicated for acromioclavicular dislocation in adults in current practice. Sufficiently powered, good quality, well-reported randomised trials of currently-used surgical interventions versus conservative treatment for well-defined injuries are required.

N2  - The pathomechanics of the throwing shoulder have yet to be fully elucidated. The focus of this study reported here was to further characterize the morphology of the glenoid in a population of elite throwing athletes. We obtained magnetic resonance imaging scans of 38 professional baseball players (dominant shoulders) and of 35 age matched nonthrowing control patients (17 dominant and 18 nondominant shoulders). Seven measurements were made by 3 blinded reviewers on 3 axial images per patient: version of superior glenoid, middle glenoid, inferior glenoid, superior capsulolabral junction, middle capsulolabral junction, inferior capsulolabral junction, and depth of concavity of glenoid in a middle slice. Mean age of the 38 players (24 pitchers, 14 fielders) was 26.8 years, and mean age of the 35 control patients was 27.6 years. Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from .55 to .84 for the version measurements. There were no statistically significant differences between the pitchers and the fielders on any of the 7 measurements, but such differences were found between the throwers and the dominant-shoulder control patients on all 7 measurements. There were only 2 differences (version of superior glenoid, depth of concavity of glenoid in a middle slice) between dominant- and nondominant- shoulder control patients. There was significantly more retroversion in the osseous and soft tissues of the elite throwing athletes than in the nonthrowing control patients. This increased retroversion may play a role in development of internal impingement in the overhead athlete.

N2  - Realistic muscle path representation is essential to musculoskeletal modeling of joint function. Algorithms predicting these muscle paths typically rely on a labor intensive predefinition of via points or underlying geometries to guide wrapping for given joint positions. While muscle wrapping using anatomically precise three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) models of bone and muscle has been achieved, computational expense and pre-processing associated with this approach exclude its use in applications such as subject-specific modeling. With the intention of combining advantageous features of both approaches, an intermediate technique relying on contact detection capabilities of commercial FE packages is presented. We applied the approach to the glenohumeral joint, and validated the method by comparison against existing experimental data. Individual muscles were modeled as a straight series of deformable beam elements and bones as anatomically precise 3D rigid bodies. Only the attachment locations and a default orientation of the undeformed muscle segment were pre-defined. The joint was then oriented in a static position of interest. The muscle segment free end was then moved along the shortest Euclidean path to its origin on the scapula, wrapping the muscle along bone surfaces by relying on software contact detection. After wrapping for a given position, the resulting moment arm was computed as the perpendicular distance from the line of action vector to the humeral head center of rotation. This approach reasonably predicted muscle length and moment arm for 27 muscle segments when compared to experimental measurements over a wide range of shoulder motion. Artificial via points or underlying contact geometries were avoided, contact detection and multiobject wrapping on the bone surfaces were automatic, and low computational cost permitted wrapping of individual muscles within seconds on a standard desktop PC. These advantages may be valuable for both general and subject-specific musculoskeletal modeling. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - When performing radiostereometric analysis (RSA), computed tomography scans are often taken to obtain the landmarks used to create anatomical coordinate systems (CSs) for quantifying joint kinematics. Different conventions for defining CSs lead to an inability to compare results among studies. The International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) has proposed a set of CSs; however, the landmarks needed to create the recommended scapular CS require the entire scapula to be scanned, thereby also exposing breast and other tissues to radiation. The main purpose of this work was to investigate an alternate definition of the CS that has repeatably attainable landmarks and axes as close as possible to those recommended by the ISB, while limiting the portion of the scapula requiring scanning. Intra- and inter-investigator variabilities of landmark digitization were quantified in one model of a scapula and one cadaveric specimen. Based on the variability of the digitizations, an alternative CS was defined. The differences between the ISB and alternative CSs were evaluated on 11 cadaveric specimens. Beaded biplanar RSA was performed on the glenohumeral joint model in 15 different configurations and the resulting kinematics were calculated for each set of landmark digitizations using both sets of coordinate systems. While the kinematic angles obtained using the alternative CS were statistically different from those obtained using the ISB standard, these differences were small (on the order of 5°) and therefore considered to be of little clinical significance. In all likelihood, the benefits of decreasing radiation exposure outweigh these differences in angles. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate the use of intramedullary nailing in the management of both "combined" and "extended" fractures of the humeral head and shaft. Design: Retrospective case series study. Setting: Level I trauma center. Patients and Intervention: Twenty-one consecutive patients who underwent intramedullary nail insertion for "extended" or "combined," closed, nonpathologic fractures of the humeral head and shaft between October 1999 and December 2006 were included in the study. Two patients were lost to follow up and one died before fracture healing. Main Outcome Measurements: Evaluation of outcomes was assessed with the use of the Constant score. Results: There were no neurovascular problems or infections. Eighteen fractures united from 4 to 7 months postoperatively. One case of avascular necrosis of the humeral head, one case of acromion impingement, and one case of unacceptable loss of reduction occurred. Shoulder range of motion was not regained fully in any case and mild shoulder discomfort remained in eight patients. The mean Constant score for all 18 patients was 74.4 (range, 20-95) for the affected side and 89.17 points for the uninjured side. The percentage created from the mean affected/unaffected side scores was 83.4%. Conclusions: Intramedullary nailing for proximal humeral fractures associated with shaft extension or segmental involvement appears to offer a reliable treatment option.

N2  - The aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of the moiré fringe projection technique (MFPT) to quantify the scapular motions relative to the thorax. This system was composed of a LCD projector, a digital photographic camera, and a microcomputer. To automatically obtain the scapular profiles, the phase shifting method was combined with the MFPT. Four fringes were projected on the scapula and four on the reference planes. By the simple subtraction of the reference values from the scapular phase maps, the map due to the moiré fringes could be digitally obtained. After the phase decoding, the tridimensional (3D) profiles were obtained without prior information about the samples and the calculations of the scapular kinematics were carried out using dedicated software. On average, the movements of lateral rotation ranged from -1.8±6.1° to -26.5±3.5°; the protraction from 28.4±4.7° to 27.7±6.8°, and the posterior tilt from -6.4±7.8° to -21.7±6.1°, during the arm elevation in the scapular plane performed by six healthy subjects. For the test-retest reliability, the intra-class correlation coefficients ranged from 0.92 to 0.997 and the maximum estimated error was 0.8%. The MFPT allowed the scapular 3D measurements to be obtained in a digital and non-invasive manner. The main advantages compared with other existing systems were its ease in implementation, the use of standard optical components, and its possible clinical applications. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Numerous techniques have been employed to monitor humeral head translation due to its involvement with several shoulder pathologies. However, most of the techniques were not validated. The objective of this study is to compare the accuracy of manual digitization and contour registration in measuring superior translation of the humeral head. Eight pairs of cadaver scapulae and humerii bones were harvested for this study. Each scapula and humerus was secured in a customized jig that allowed for control of humeral head translations and a vise that permitted rotations of the scapula about three axes. Fluoroscopy was used to take images of the shoulder bones. Scapular orientation was manipulated in different positions while the humerus was at 90° of humeral elevation in the scapular plane. Humeral head translation was measured using the two methods and was compared to the known translation. Additionally, accuracy of the contour registration method to measure 2-D scapular rotations was assessed. The range for the root mean square (RMS) error for manual digitization method was 0.27. mm - 0.43. mm and the contour registration method had a RMS error ranging from 0.18. mm - 0.40. mm. In addition, the RMS error for the scapular angle rotation using the contour registration method was 2.4°. Both methods showed acceptable errors. However, on average, the contour registration method showed lesser measurement error compared to the manual digitization method. In addition, the contour registration method was able to show good accuracy in measuring rotation that is useful in 2-D image analysis. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background: Accurate analysis of osseous glenoid morphology is important in treating glenohumeral arthritis and instability. Two-dimensional computed tomography scans are used to evaluate glenoid alignment. Accuracy of this method is dependent on the angle of axial reconstruction in relation to the position of the scapula. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of scapular rotation in the coronal and sagittal planes on glenoid version as measured on two-dimensional images. Methods: Computer-generated three-dimensional models of scapulae from computed tomography scans of thirty-six shoulders in whole-body cadavers were generated. The anatomic geometry of these models had been previously validated. The position of the scapulae relative to the gantry was determined. The three-dimensional models were rotated in 1° increments in the coronal and sagittal planes. Glenoid version was measured on two-dimensional images for each of the rotation increments. Version variability at each rotation increment was calculated. Results: The anatomic glenoid version (independent of the resting position of the scapula) was an average (and standard deviation) of 2.0° ± 3.8° of retroversion. The average difference between anatomic glenoid version and clinical glenoid version (depending on the position of the scapula on the original computed tomography axial images) was 6.9° ± 5.6° (range, 0.1° to 22.5°). Version variability with coronal or sagittal rotation was significant for all degrees of rotation (p < 0.0001). Scapular abduction had the greatest effect on version variation and resulted in 0.42° of relative anteversion for every 1° of abduction in the coronal plane. In the sagittal plane, internal rotation resulted in relative anteversion. Conclusions: Any malalignment of ≥1° of the scapula in the coronal or sagittal plane will create inaccuracies in measuring glenoid version. The plane of axial reconstruction should be aligned with the scapula when two-dimensional computed tomography images are used to measure glenoid version. These findings support the use of three-dimensional models to evaluate glenoid version. Clinical Relevance: When computed tomography scans are made to evaluate glenoid version, the plane of axial reconstruction must be taken into account. In contrast, glenoid version measured on three-dimensional models is independent of scapular position. Copyright © 2010 by The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Incorporated.

N2  - Non-accidental injury (NAI) in children includes orthopaedic trauma throughout the skeleton. Fractures with soft-tissue injuries constitute the majority of manifestations of physical abuse in children. Fracture and injury patterns vary with age and development, and NAI is intrinsically related to the mobility of the child. No fracture in isolation is pathognomonic of NAI, but specific abuse-related injuries include multiple fractures, particularly at various stages of healing, metaphyseal corner and bucket-handle fractures and fractures of ribs. Isolated or multiple rib fractures, irrespective of location, have the highest specificity for NAI. Other fractures with a high specificity for abuse include those of the scapula, lateral end of the clavicle, vertebrae and complex skull fractures. Injuries caused by NAI constitute a relatively small proportion of childhood fractures. They may be associated with significant physical and psychological morbidity, with wide-ranging effects from deviations in normal developmental progression to death. Orthopaedic surgeons must systematically assess, recognise and act on the indicators for NAI in conjunction with the paediatric multidisciplinary team. ©2010 British Editorial Society of Bone and Joint Surgery.

N2  - Study Design: Before and after intervention trials. Objective: To investigate the effect of cervical muscular fatigue on joint position sense. Summary of Background Data: Although fatigue-related degradation of proprioceptive acuity at lower and upper limbs is well documented, to date no study has investigated whether muscular fatigue induced at the neck could modify joint position sense. Methods: A total of 9 young healthy adults were asked to perform the cervicocephalic relocation test to the neutral head position, that is, to relocate the head on the trunk, as accurately as possible, after full active cervical rotation to the left and right sides. This experimental task was executed in 2 conditions of No fatigue and Fatigue of the scapula elevator muscles. Absolute and variable errors were used to assess the cervical joint repositioning accuracy and consistency, respectively. Results: Less accurate and less consistent repositioning performances were observed in Fatigue relative to No fatigue condition, as indicated by increased absolute and variable errors, respectively. Conclusion: Results of the present experiment evidence that cervical joint position sense, assessed through the cervicocephalic relocation test to the neutral head position, is degraded by muscular fatigue. © 2010, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Physiological tremor and strength during the maintenance of shoulder position occur during a precision aiming task, such as archery. It is unclear how positions for precision demands affect physiological tremor and associated muscular activities. The purpose of this study was to assess the tremor amplitude and muscular activities of the shoulder between the various positions for precision demands. Ten males (age 21.9 +/- 2.0 years) participated in the study. Electromyography (EMG) was quantified on eight humeral/scapular muscles. The tremor was measured by the acceleration component of a motion tracking sensor in the 3-7 Hz and 8-12 Hz frequency bands. Participants simulated six preparatory archery shooting positions (3 arm angles x 2 arm draw positions) and performed isometric contractions. The relative root mean square (RMS) amplitudes of the shoulder muscles were significantly greater for the full drawing position compared with the partial position (humeral muscles: P = 0.011; scapular muscles: P = 0.026). In the full drawing position, increased humeral/scapular muscle EMG amplitude was moderately associated with an increased power spectrum of 8-12/3-7 Hz tremor in humerus/scapula motion (R = 0.43-0.57). To minimize fluctuations in high strength muscle performance, 90 degrees of elevation in the full drawing position may be a suitable position for demands in archery. In addition, scapular muscle amplitude is important for stability to reduce humerus tremor during archery performance.

N2  - Purpose To investigate the reproducibility of shoulder bony landmarks location using the EOS® low-dose stereoradiography system, in order to validate this new tool for the study of gleno-humeral pseudo-kinematics. Methods An inter and intraobserver reproducibility study of shoulder bony landmarks location concerning 22 healthy volunteers. This study concerned the neutral position, arm at rest. Humerus and scapula were modeled with simple geometric shapes using specific software. Those shapes were positioned on A-P and lateral x-rays views. Images analysis of the 22 subjects was carried out three times (nr = 3), by two observers (no = 2), for a total of ntot = 132 analyses. Results We obtained a very good reproducibility for the humeral head center and the diaphysis axis with 95% confidence interval (IC95%) inferior to 1.09 mm and 0.41°, respectively. The uncertainty was higher for the lateral and medial epicondyles. Regarding the scapular bony landmarks, we observed a good reproducibility for the tip of the coracoid process, the inferior glenoid rim, and the axillar border with a 95% confidence interval lower than 2.13, 2.91 mm, and 3.67°, respectively. The uncertainty was higher for the most postero-lateral point of the acromion and the superior glenoid rim. Conclusion Our analysis of the x-rays obtained with the EOS® low-dose stereoradiography system assessed the location reliability and reproducibility of specific scapular and humeral bony landmarks. This work opens the way to gleno-humeral pseudo-kinematics analysis using EOS® imaging system.

N2  - Noninvasive measurement of scapular kinematics using skin surface markers presents technical challenges due to the relative movement between the scapula and the overlying skin. The objectives of this study were to develop a noninvasive subject-specific skin correction factor that would enable a more accurate measurement of scapular kinematics and evaluate this new technique via comparison with a gold standard for scapular movement. Scapular kinematics were directly measured using bone pins instrumented with optoelectronic marker carriers in eight healthy volunteers while skin motion was measured simultaneously with optoelectronic markers attached to the skin surface overlying the scapula. The relative motion between the skin markers and the underlying scapula was estimated over a range of humeral orientations by palpating and digitizing bony landmarks on the scapula and then used to calculate correction factors that were weighted by humeral orientation. The scapular kinematics using these correction factors were compared with the kinematics measured via the bone pins during four arm movements in the volunteers: abduction, forward reaching, hand behind back, and horizontal adduction. The root-mean-square (rms) errors for the kinematics determined from skin markers without the skin correction factors ranged from 5.1 deg to 9.5 deg while the rms errors with the skin correction factors ranged from 1.4 deg to 3.0 deg. This technique appeared to perform well for different movements and could possibly be extended to other applications. Copyright © 2009 by ASME.

N2  - Purpose: The purposes of this study were to (1) assess the inter-rater reliability and validity of 2 clinical assessment methods of categorizing scapular dyskinesis and (2) quantify the frequency of asymmetry of bilateral scapular motion in injured and uninjured shoulders by use of 3-dimensional (3D) kinematic analysis. Methods: We evaluated 56 subjects, 35 with shoulder injury and 21 with no symptoms. Two blinded evaluators categorized the scapular motion of all subjects to determine inter-rater reliability using 2 observational methods ("yes/no" and "4 type") to evaluate scapular dyskinesis. Subjects were also instrumented with electromagnetic receivers to assess bilateral 3D scapular kinematics to determine the presence of dyskinesis and establish criterion validity of the 2 methods. Results: The inter-rater percent agreement and the degree of this agreement as measured by κ statistic showed that the yes/no method produced a higher inter-rater percent agreement (79%, κ = 0.40) than the 4-type method (61%, κ = 0.44). The yes/no method had a higher sensitivity (76%) and positive predictive value (74%) when compared with the 3D criterion. A χ2 analysis found significantly more multiple-plane asymmetries in symptomatic subjects (54%) in flexion compared with asymptomatic subjects (14%) (P = .002). Conclusions: The yes/no method allows multiple-plane asymmetries to be considered in clinical assessment and therefore renders this a good screening tool for the presence of scapular dyskinesis. Kinematic analysis shows that asymmetries are common in symptomatic and asymptomatic populations. Testing in flexion showed a higher frequency of multiple-plane scapular asymmetries in the symptomatic group. Clinical Relevance: Identification of scapular dyskinesis is a key component of the shoulder examination. The clinician's ability to establish the presence or absence of scapular dyskinesis by observation is enhanced using a simple yes/no method especially when testing subjects in shoulder forward flexion. Although scapular asymmetries appear to be a prevalent finding, dyskinesis in the presence of shoulder symptoms should be considered a potential factor contributing to the dysfunction in the presence of shoulder symptoms should be considered a potential factor contributing to the dysfunction. © 2009 Arthroscopy Association of North America.

N2  - Context: Scapular strength deficits have been linked to shoulder dysfunction. Objective: To establish normative data on the scapulothoracic musculature in normal subjects using a handheld dynamometer. Design: Descriptive normative data study. Setting: Field research. Subjects: 172 subjects with varying levels of overhead activity. Methods: A handheld dynamometer was used to test the upper, middle, and lower trapezius; rhomboids; and serratus anterior. Main Outcome Measures: A 2-factor ANOVA was performed for each of the muscles by activity level and unilateral ratio by activity-level analyses. Post hoc analysis included multiple pairwise comparisons, using the Dunn-Bonferroni correction method. Results: Activity level did not significantly affect the unilateral ratios: Elevation:depression was 2.5:1, upward:downward rotation was 1.5:1, and protraction:retraction was 1.25:1. A rank order from strongest to weakest was established through significant comparisons. Conclusion: The unilateral ratios along with the rank order should be considered when discussing scapular rehabilitation protocols. © 2009 Human Kinetics, Inc.

N2  - Hypothesis: The impingement mechanisms of the Neer and Hawkins sign remain unclear. In addition, there is still a lack of agreement regarding the arm rotation when performing the Neer sign. Materials and methods: Eight fresh frozen cadaveric shoulders were investigated. The specimens were attached to a shoulder-positioning device to which a compression force was applied. Subacromial contact pressure was measured with a flexible force sensor. The Neer sign was performed in three arm rotations (neutral, internal, and external). Results: The contact sites of the coracoacromial arch side were common in both signs; however, those of the humeral head side were anatomically different: the supraspinatus tendon in the Neer sign and the subscapularis tendon in the Hawkins sign. The mean contact pressure in the Neer sign performed with the arm in internal rotation was greater than that in the Neer sign with the arm in other rotations. Discussion: The data from this study indicate that the Neer and Hawkins signs do not represent the same impingement mechanism. The contact sites on the humeral head side were anatomically different. Additionally, it was found that the maximum contact pressure for the Neer sign is with internal rotation of the arm.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively analyze the research progress of repair mode and repair material during acromioclavicular dislocation operation. DATA SOURCE: The first author retrieved CNKI database (http://dlib.cnki.net) and PubMed database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) published from January 1996 to April 2009, with the key words of "acromioclavicular joint, dislocation, operative treatment, literature review". DATA SELECTION: Original articles and articles with reliable evidences, definite opinion, full analysis, and the same content as literatures were included. Duplicated studies were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Literatures addressing repair mode and repair materials for acromioclavicular dislocation operation were included, containing 206 Chinese articles and 229 English articles. 391 literatures with old or duplicated contents were excluded, finally 44 were coincided with criteria. RESULTS: As the acromioclavicular joint is a kind of non-rigid and micro-movement joint, the traditional kinds of rigid fixation are non-anatomical and the result of these treatments is below expectation. During the process of exploring treatments, we gradually come to realize the importance of coracoclavicular ligament was very important to keep the stability of acromioclavicular joint. Repairative and reconstructive style and repairing materials had been the current focus. CONCLUSION: This article reviews the advances in acromioclavicular joint fixation, coracoclavicular interval fixation, coracoclavicular reconstruction and repairing, dynamic muscle transfers and excision of the distal clavicular clavicle, pointing out their advantages and disadvantages as well as the research direction in the future. Traditional fixation method requires solving the problems of how to dissect and reset acromioclavicular joint. The method of reestablishing and repairing coracoclavicular ligament in material choice, biomechanics, long-term clinical follow-up should be improved.

N2  - The shoulder complex is prone to numerous pathologies and instabilities due to its large range of motion. The extent of injury is assessed through a series of observations and physical examinations. It is hypothesized that objective kinematic analysis of the shoulder could yield useful functional insights to aid clinical practice. Non-invasive motion analysis techniques to monitor shoulder function have been developed using passive markers; however, accurate measurement of scapula kinematics is problematic because of overlying tissue. The scapula locator is the accepted standard by which alternative non-invasive techniques of scapula tracking are validated. In this study, the viability of using skin-mounted markers to measure dynamic scapula movement is determined. Complete kinematic descriptions of ten healthy shoulders were obtained. Elevations of the glenohumeral joint were similar with both techniques, indicating that the skin marker method is suitable for gathering functional glenohumeral data. The main differences of note are seen at the scapulothoracic articulation where the skin marker method underestimated lateral rotation by more than 50 degrees at maximum elevation. However, the correlation between the two approaches is greater than 0.7, suggesting that it may be possible to derive linear regression models to predict dynamic scapulothoracic lateral rotation accurately using skin-mounted scapula markers.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The management of acromioclavicular (AC) injuries has long been debated. We analyzed our results in treating such cases using hook plates and ligament suture. DESIGN: Retrospective nonrandomized study. SETTING: Level I Trauma Center (University Hospital). PATIENTS: Twenty-five patients (mean age 41 years) with complete Tossy III AC joint disruptions. Using the Rockwood classification, 15 dislocations were classified as type V injuries, 9 as type III injuries, and 1 as a type IV injury. INTERVENTION: All patients were operatively treated using AC hook plates with ligament suturing after a median delay of 7 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and radiographic evaluation using Constant-Murley functional score and Taft et al criteria. RESULTS: A retrospective clinical and radiographic evaluation of 23 patients was performed after an average follow-up period of 30 months. The mean Constant score was 97 (range, 90-100) points, and the mean Taft score was 10.6 points. All but 1 patient were satisfied with their treatment outcome. Eight cases showed some loss of reduction after plate removal. A poor correlation existed, however, between clinical and radiographic results. CONCLUSIONS: The hook plate is a reliable fixation tool for complete AC joint dislocations, ensuring immediate stability and allowing early mobilization with good functional and cosmetic results. Routine plate removal should however be reevaluated. Copyright © 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Context: The reliability of the measurement of the distance between the posterior border of the acromion and the wall and the reliability of the modified lateral scapular slide test have not been studied. Overall, the reliability of the clinical tools used to assess scapular positioning has not been studied in musicians. Objective: To examine the intertester reliability of scapular observation and 2 clinical tests for the assessment of scapular positioning in musicians. Design: Intertester reliability study. Setting: University research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Thirty healthy student musicians at a single university. Main Outcome Measure(s): Two assessors performed a standardized observation protocol, the measurement of the distance between the posterior border of the acromion and the wall, and the modified lateral scapular slide test. Each assessor was blinded to the other's findings. Results: The intertester reliability coefficients (κ) for the observation in relaxed position, during unloaded movement, and during loaded movement were 0.41, 0.63, and 0.36, respectively. The κ values for the observation of tilting and winging at rest were 0.48 and 0.42, respectively; during unloaded movement, the κ values were 0.52 and 0.78, respectively; and with a 1-kg load, the κ values were 0.24 and 0.50, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the measurement of the acromial distance was 0.72 in relaxed position and 0.75 with the participant actively retracting both shoulders. The ICCs for the modified lateral scapular slide test varied between 0.63 and 0.58. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the modified lateral scapular slide test was not a reliable tool to assess scapular positioning in these participants. Our data indicated that scapular observation in the relaxed position and during unloaded abduction in the frontal plane was a reliable assessment tool. The reliability of the measurement of the distance between the posterior border of the acromion and the wall in healthy musicians was moderate. © by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effects of internal fixation with double endobutton for the treatment of acromioclavicular joint dislocation of Tossy Grade III. METHODS: From 2007.7 to 2008.12, 27 patients with acromioclavicular joint dislocation of Tossy Grade III were fixed with double endobutton. Among the patients, 17 patients were male and 10 patients were female, with an average age of (35.0 +/- 1.3) years (ranged from 23 to 60 years). Fourteen patients were injured by traffic accident, 6 patients were work-related injuries, 4 patients were sports injuries, and 3 patients were injured by falling down. Sixteen patients had injuries in the left, and 11 patients in the right. All the patients were Tossy III type dislocation without clavicle fracture. The therapeutic effects were evaluated by Karlsson criteria based on range of motion of acromioclavicular joint, pain, muscle force and postreduction X-ray. RESULTS: All the patients were followed up for 6 to 14 months, mean 10.2 months. According to the Karlsson score criteria, 24 patients obtained an excellent result, 2 fair and 1 poor. CONCLUSION: Fixation with double endobutton is to be a new method for the treatment of acromioclavicular joint dislocation, which has the advantages of minimal trauma, reliable fixation, early functional rehabilitation and so on.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Impingement syndrome is probably the most common cause of shoulder pain. Abnormal abduction and proximal humeral translation are associated with this condition. We evaluated whether the relative distribution between glenohumeral and scapular-trunk motions (the scapulohumeral rhythm) and the speed of motion of the arm differed between patients with impingement and a control group without shoulder symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 30 patients with shoulder impingement (Neer stage 2) and 11 controls were studied during active abduction and 21 patients and 9 controls were studied during passive abduction. Dynamic RSA at a speed of 2 simultaneous exposures per second was used to record the shoulder motions for 5-6 seconds. RESULTS: Within the interval statistically evaluated (observations between 20-55 degrees of relative active abduction in the glenohumeral joint), the patient group showed more scapular and trunk motions (p = 0.04), especially at up to 40 degrees. The pattern of motion at passive abduction was somewhat similar to that in the controls. Both controls and patients showed an increasing absolute (i.e. global) proximal displacement of the center of the humeral head with increasing active and passive abduction of the glenohumeral joint and humerus, without any certain difference between the groups. The mean maximum absolute proximal displacement in the patient and control groups amounted to about 30 mm and 20 mm, respectively. The corresponding relative displacement (with fixed scapula) was only 2.0 and 0.5 mm. Active abduction was initiated with angular velocity of about 50 and 80 degrees per second, respectively, in the patients and the controls. In both groups it decreased with progressing abduction down to about 20 degrees per second (controls) after 3 seconds without there being any statistically significant difference. The angular velocities at passive abduction showed a similar pattern, still without any difference. In both groups, the speed of proximal translation during active abduction peaked 0.5-1 second later than the speed of rotation and remained relatively even for about 1 second, followed by a deceleration. INTERPRETATION: We found that the glenohumeral-thoracoscapular ratio during abduction of the arm in our study, measured as the distribution of motion between the glenohumeral joint and the trunk in both controls and patients with impingement, was less than or equal to 1:1. This finding differs from earlier results, probably due to the use of a method with high resolution and small influence of motions out of the frontal plane. The reason for reduced glenohumeral motions in the early phase of active abduction in the patient group is uncertain, but pain or avoidance of pain elicited by the motion was probably of importance.

N2  - Introduction: The scapula is a relatively uncommon site for primary bone sarcomas. Tumors arising from the scapula are often initially contained by the rotator cuff muscles that protect pertinent adjacent muscles as well as the brachial plexus and axillary blood vessels. Limb-sparing resection of a scapula sarcoma is technically complex and requires meticulous dissection and mobilization of the brachial plexus and axillary blood vessels. Several muscles must be capable of being preserved in order to reconstruct the scapula and shoulder girdle with a special customized total scapula replacement. The goal of reconstruction is to restore a stable shoulder girdle to preserve elbow and hand function. Methods and Results: In the procedure demonstrated in this video, limb-sparing scapula resection and reconstruction was performed for a patient with a multicentric epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. The steps of the procedure are detailed along with accommodations made for the multicentric nature of the tumor. To allow for optimal postoperative function and maximum soft tissue coverage, a small constrained scapular prosthesis was utilized. The glenohumeral ligaments were reconstructed with a Gore-Tex aortic graft. Multiple muscle rotation flaps were performed to cover and protect the prosthesis as well as restore shoulder girdle stability. Conclusion: Limb-sparing surgery for scapula sarcomas and anatomic reconstruction with a constrained total scapula prosthesis is a reliable and safe technique for resecting selected sarcomas and reconstructing the shoulder girdle. A stable shoulder girdle can be restored for optimal hand and elbow function. A total scapula prosthetic reconstruction is the authors' procedure of choice when the deltoid, trapezius, rhomboid, latissimus, and serratus anterior muscles are capable of being preserved. The functional outcome is superior to a forequarter amputation and a flail (nonreconstructed) shoulder in which the extremity is left hanging by soft tissues (nonanatomic method). © 2009 Society of Surgical Oncology.

N2  - The acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) is a common source of pain and disability. Several provocative tests are used to diagnose ACJ lesions. The aim of this study was to evaluate anatomic changes of the ACJ using dynamic ultrasonography during provocative tests. Eighty ACJs of 40 healthy volunteers were subjected to dynamic ultrasonographic examinations. Examinations were performed in a resting position and during passive external rotation, cross body adduction, and active compression testing. Deep joint space distance and capsule displacement were measured ultrasonographically. Mean deep joint space distances during cross body adduction (6.4 6 1.6 mm) and active compression (6.6 6 1.8 mm) testing were significantly smaller than during passive external rotation testing (7.7 6 1.7 mm, P < 0.01) or rest (8.1 6 1.8 mm, P < 0.01). Mean capsule displacements during active compression (3.5 6 0.8 mm) and cross body adduction (3.4 6 0.7 mm) testing were significantly greater than those during passive external rotation testing (2.9 6 0.7 mm, P < 0.01) or rest (2.5 6 0.7 mm, P < 0.01). Dynamic ultrasonography revealed that the cross body adduction and active compression tests applied more stress to the ACJ than the passive external rotation test, which suggests that these two tests are likely to be more useful provocative tests for the diagnosis of ACJ lesions. Furthermore, the dynamic properties of ultrasonography could be used to estimate the suitability and validity of provocative tests in other musculoskeletal diseases. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - This study aimed to find the most appropriate marker location, or combination thereof, for the centre of the humeral head (Wang et al. in J Biomech 31: 899-908, 1998) location representation during humeral motion. Ten male participants underwent three MRI scans in three different humeral postures. Seven technical coordinate systems (TCS) were defined from various combinations of an acromion, distal upper arm and proximal upper arm clusters of markers in a custom Matlab program. The CHH location was transformed between postures and then compared with the original MRI CHH location. The results demonstrated that following the performance of two near 180° humeral elevations, a combined acromion TCS and proximal upper arm TCS produced an average error of 23 ± 9 mm, and 18 ± 4 mm, which was significantly smaller (p < 0.01) than any other TCS. A combination of acromion and proximal upper arm TCSs should therefore be used to reference the CHH location when analysing movements incorporating large ranges of shoulder motion. © International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering 2009.

N2  - The functional outcome of shoulder replacement is related to the condition of the rotator cuff. Rotator cuff disease is a common problem in candidates for total shoulder arthroplasty; this study relates the functional status of the rotator cuff to the initial stability of a cementless glenoid implant. A 3D finite element model of a complete scapula was used to quantify the effect of a dysfunctional rotator cuff in terms of bone-implant interface micromotions when the implant is physiologically loaded shortly after surgery. Four rotator cuff conditions (from fully intact to progressively ruptured rotator cuff tendons) as well as two bone qualities were simulated in a model. Micromotions were significantly larger in the worst modeled cuff dysfunction (i.e. the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons were fully dysfunctional). Micromotions were also significantly different between conditions with healthy and poor bone quality. The implant's initial stability was hardly influenced by a dysfunctional supraspinatus alone. However, when the infraspinatus was also affected, the glenohumeral joint force was displaced to the component's rim resulting in larger micromotions and instability of the implant. © The Author(s) 2009.

N2  - The objective of the study was to compare the precision of shoulder anatomical landmark palpation using a CAST-like method and a newly developed anatomical palpator device (called A-Palp) using the forefinger pulp directly. The repeated-measures experimental design included four examiners that twice repeated measurements on eleven scapula and humerus anatomical landmarks during two sessions. Inter-session and inter-examiner precision was determined on volunteers. A-Palp accuracy was obtained from in vitro measurements and using virtual palpation on 3D bone models. Error propagation on the motion representation was also analyzed for a continuous motion of abduction movement performed in the shoulder joint. Palpation results showed that CAST and A-Palp methods lead to similar precision with the Maximal A-Palp calibration error being 1.5 mm. In vivo precision of the CAST and A-Palp methods varied between 4 mm (inter-session) and 8 mm (inter-examiner). Mean propagation of the palpation error on the motion graph representation was 2° and 5° for scapula and humerus, respectively. A-Palp accuracy was 3.6 and 8.1 mm for scapula and humerus, respectively. The A-Palp seems promising and could probably become an additional method next to today's marker-based motion analysis systems (i.e., Helen-Hayes configuration, CAST method). © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty is a treatment option for cuff tear arthropathy. Scapular notching remains a concern. This biomechanical study compared the range-of-motion in different designs of glenospheres and hence the relative risk of scapular notching. Method: A precision coordinate device was used to investigate four different designs of glenospheres (SMR prosthesis); 36mm concentric (Standard), 36 mm eccentric, 44 mm concentric, and 44 mm eccentric glenospheres. The centre of rotation in each design was first established. The position of the humeral prosthesis was recorded in the plane of the scapula to compare the degree of adduction and the total range-of-motion. Results: Eccentric glenospheres were found to improve range-of-motion by allowing a higher degree of adduction. Larger diameter glenospheres were found to improve range-of-motion by increasing adduction and abduction. Compared to the 36 mm concentric (standard) glenosphere, the 36 mm eccentric glenosphere improved adduction by 14.5 degrees, the 44 mm concentric glenosphere improved adduction by 11.6 degrees, the 44 mm eccentric glenosphere improved adduction by 17.7 degrees. Conclusion: Eccentric glenospheres with a center-of-rotation placed more inferiorly were shown to improve adduction. This design may reduce the clinical incidence of scapular notching. Level of evidence: Basic science study. © 2009 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Knowledge of the anatomy of the glenohumeral ligaments is useful in detecting pathology. These ligaments are variable in number and variable in size. Stability of the glenohumeral joint is based on multiple factors. Therefore glenohumeral ligament lesions are associated with coexisting structural abnormalities including capsule, labrum, rotator cuff, coracoacromial arch and bone. Magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography is the method of choice to visualize intraarticular pathology.

N2  - Digitizing bony landmarks is a common technique used to measure scapular position, but it has not been validated against a gold standard. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of this technique for four physiological arm movements using optoelectronic markers mounted on scapular bone pins as a gold standard. Eight subjects had bone pins inserted into their lateral scapular spine. Three points were digitized on the scapula with an optoelectronic probe: the medial root of the scapular spine, the posterolateral corner of the acromion, and the inferior angle of the scapula. The four active movements tested in this study were glenohumeral abduction, glenohumeral horizontal adduction, hand behind back, and forward reaching. The three bony landmarks were digitized six times in three different positions for each movement. Data from one subject were rejected secondary to pin loosening. The overall position-specific r.m.s. errors ranged from 2.0 degrees to 12.5 degrees. The full abduction position had considerably higher r.m.s. errors than the other positions (posterior tipping, 12.5 degrees; upward rotation, 7.3 degrees; internal rotation, 12.0 degrees). It appears that the digitization of bony landmarks may be a valid method for measuring changes in scapular attitude with the following caveats: the full abduction position has a high r.m.s. error, and small scapular motions have high percentage errors.

N2  - The object of this study was to assess interobserver reliability in 23 tests concerning physical examination of the shoulder girdle. A physical therapist and a physical therapist/manual therapist independently performed a physical examination of the shoulder girdle in 91 patients with shoulder complaints of varying severity and duration. The observers assessed 23 items in total: active and passive abductions, passive external rotation, hand in neck (HIN) test, hand in back (HIB) test, impingement test according to Neer, springing test of the first rib and joint play test of the acromioclavicular joint. The interobserver reliability was evaluated by means of a Cohen's Kappa, the weighted Kappa and the intraclass correlation (ICC). Criteria for acceptable reliability were: Kappa value ≥ 0.60, ICC ≥ 0.75 or an absolute agreement ≥ 80%. The results showed that Kappa values varied from 0.09 (springing test first rib, stiffness) to 0.66 (springing test first rib, pain), weighted Kappa varied from 0.35 (pain during HIB) to 0.73 (range of motion HIB) and ICC varied from 0.54 (abduction passive starting point painful arc) to 0.96 (active and passive ranges of motion in abduction). In total 11 (48%) items fulfilled the criteria of acceptable reliability. In conclusion, there appears to be a great deal of variation in the reliability of the tests used in the physical examination of the shoulder girdle. Over 50% of the tests did not meet the statistical criteria for acceptable reliability. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of the reach distance on the muscle activation during a reach-to-grasp movement in the sitting position. Ten healthy male volunteers were tested. Surface EMG were recorded for the deltoid scapular, the deltoid clavicular, the triceps brachii, the biceps brachii and the brachoradialis. These muscles have been selected for their contribution to the cylindrical palmar prehension motion in the sagittal plane. Three distances have been tested: 20, 30 and 40 cm. For each distance, ten repeated measures have been recorded. From this in vivo data, the repeatability of the protocol has been tested. For this, relative (ICC) and absolute (SEM) reliabilities are determined in order to evaluate the intra operator repeatability of this protocol. It appears that the ICC values obtained are between 0.78 and 0.99 in all the conditions (15 conditions corresponding to three distances and five muscles). The intra operator repeatability is thus confirmed. From these surface EMG recordings the muscle activations have been calculated as the iEMG value. It appears that the muscle activation is greater with increased distances. The results contribute to the identification of the levels of muscle activation amplitude during a simple reach-to-grasp movement that is common in prehension research. This knowledge is essential in order to calculate the muscle forces and to integrate these forces in the prehension models developed nowadays in the robotic, rehabilitation, ergonomics field of research. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Context: The body of knowledge concerning shoulder kinematics in patients with rotator cuff tears is increasing. However, the level of understanding regarding how pain and tear size affect these kinematic patterns is minimal. Objective: To identify relationships between pain associated with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear, tear size, and scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) and to determine whether pain and tear size serve as predictors of SHR. Design: A test-retest design was used to quantify pain and SHR before and after a subacromial lidocaine injection. Correlation and multivariate analyses were used to identify relationships among pain, tear size, and SHR. Setting: Orthopaedic biomechanics research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Fifteen patients (age range, 40-75 years) with diagnosed full-thickness rotator cuff tears participated. They were experiencing pain at the time of testing. Intervention(s): Shoulder kinematic data were collected with an electromagnetic tracking system before and after the patient received a lidocaine injection. Main Outcome Measure(s): Pain was rated using a visual analog scale. Three-dimensional scapular kinematics and glenohumeral elevation were assessed. Scapular kinematics included anterior-posterior tilt, medial-lateral tilt, and upward-downward rotation. A regression model was used to calculate SHR (scapular kinematics to glenohumeral elevation) for phases of humeral elevation and lowering. Results: Linear relationships were identified between initial pain scores and SHR and between tear size and SHR, representing an increased reliance on scapular motion with increasing pain and tear size. Pain was identified as an independent predictor of SHR, whereas significant findings for the effect of tear size on SHR and the interaction between pain and tear size were limited. Conclusions: We noted an increased reliance on scapular contributions to overall humeral elevation with increasing levels of pain and rotator cuff tear size. Pain associated with a rotator cuff tear serves as a primary contributor to the kinematic patterns exhibited in patients with rotator cuff tears. © by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.

N2  - Context: Shoulder injuries are common in athletes involved in overhead sports, and scapular dyskinesis is believed to be one causative factor in these injuries. Many authors assert that abnormal scapular motion, so-called dyskinesis, is related to shoulder injury, but evidence from 3-dimensional measurement studies regarding this relationship is mixed. Reliable and valid clinical methods for detecting scapular dyskinesis are lacking. Objective: To determine the interrater reliability of a new test designed to detect abnormal scapular motion. Design: Correlation design using ratings from multiple pairs of testers. Setting: University athletic training facilities. Patients or Other Participants: A sample of 142 athletes (from National Collegiate Athletic Association Divisions I and III) participating in sports requiring intense overhead arm use. Intervention(s): Participants were videotaped from the posterior aspect while performing 5 repetitions of bilateral, weighted (1.4-kg [3-lb] or 2.3-kg [5-lb]) shoulder flexion and frontal-plane abduction. Videotapes from randomly chosen participants were subsequently viewed and independently rated for the presence of scapular dyskinesis by 6 raters (3 pairs), with each pair rating 30 different participants. Raters were trained to detect scapular dyskinesis using a self-instructional format with standardized operational definitions and videotaped examples of normal and abnormal motion. Main Outcome Measure(s): Scapular dyskinesis was defined as the presence of either winging or dysrhythmia. Right and left sides were rated independently as normal, subtle, or obvious dyskinesis. We calculated percentage of agreement and weighted kappa (κw) coefficients to determine reliability. Results: Percentage of agreement was between 75% and 82%, and κw ranged from 0.48 to 0.61. Conclusions: The test for scapular dyskinesis showed satisfactory reliability for clinical use in a sample of overhead athletes known to be at increased risk for shoulder symptoms. © by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.

N2  - Context: Although clinical methods for detecting scapular dyskinesis have been described, evidence supporting the validity of these methods is lacking. Objective: To determine the validity of the scapular dyskinesis test, a visually based method of identifying abnormal scapular motion. A secondary purpose was to explore the relationship between scapular dyskinesis and shoulder symptoms. Design: Validation study comparing 3-dimensional measures of scapular motion among participants clinically judged as having either normal motion or scapular dyskinesis. Setting: University athletic training facilities. Patients or Other Participants: A sample of 142 collegiate athletes (National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I and Division III) participating in sports requiring overhead use of the arm was rated, and 66 of these underwent 3-dimensional testing. Intervention(s): Volunteers were viewed by 2 raters while performing weighted shoulder flexion and abduction. The right and left sides were rated independently as normal, subtle dyskinesis, or obvious dyskinesis using the scapular dyskinesis test. Symptoms were assessed using the Penn Shoulder Score. Main Outcome Measure(s): Athletes judged as having either normal motion or obvious dyskinesis underwent 3-dimensional electromagnetic kinematic testing while performing the same movements. The kinematic data from both groups were compared via multifactor analysis of variance with post hoc testing using the least significant difference procedure. The relationship between symptoms and scapular dyskinesis was evaluated by odds ratios. Results: Differences were found between the normal and obvious dyskinesis groups. Participants with obvious dyskinesis showed less scapular upward rotation (P < .001), less clavicular elevation (P < .001), and greater clavicular protraction (P = .044). The presence of shoulder symptoms was not different between the normal and obvious dyskinesis volunteers (odds ratio = 0.79, 95% confidence interval = 0.33, 1.89). Conclusions: Shoulders visually judged as having dyskinesis showed distinct alterations in 3-dimensional scapular motion. However, the presence of scapular dyskinesis was not related to shoulder symptoms in athletes engaged in overhead sports. © by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.

N2  - Objective: This study presents an effective repair method for the hemimandibular and oral defects produced during the ablation of advanced oral malignant tumours. Methods: Nine patients (five males and four females ranging in age from 18 to 74 years; mean age 51.3 years) with advanced oral malignant tumours were treated at our institution. Trapezius osteomyocutaneous island flaps (TOIFs) including the acromion, spine, and part of the medial scapular border were used to repair the hemimandibular and oral defects. Results: No major flap failure occurred. Donor-site problems have been minimal, with limited shoulder motion in all patients. The functional results in terms of speech, swallowing, and facial contour were satisfactory. The patients were followed for 6-24 months (average 15.2 months): six of them are alive with no disease, two alive with disease; and one has died of a lung metastasis. Conclusion: The TOIF is large, simple, and reliable, and is preferred for reconstructing hemimandibular and oral defects. © 2008 European Association for Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery.

N2  - Accurate spatial location of joint center (JC) is a key issue in motion analysis since JC locations are used to define standardized anatomical frames, in which results are represented. Accurate and reproducible JC location is important for data comparison and data exchange. This paper presents a method for JC locations based on the multiple regression algorithms without preliminary assumption on the behavior of the joint-of-interest. Regression equations were obtained from manually palpable ALs on each bone-of-interest. Results are presented for all joint surfaces found on the clavicle, scapula and humeral bone. Mean accuracy errors on the JC locations obtained on dry bones were 5.2±2.5 mm for the humeral head, 2.5±1.1 mm for the humeral trochlea, 2.3±0.9 mm for the humeral capitulum, 8.2±3.9 mm for the scapula glenoid cavity, 7.2±3.2 mm for the scapular aspect of the acromio-clavicular joint, 3.5±1.8 mm for the clavicular aspect of the sternoclavicular joint and 3.2±1.4 mm for the clavicular aspect of the acromio-clavicular joint. In-vitro and in-vivo validation accuracy was 5.3 and 8.5 mm, respectively, for the humeral head center location. Regression coefficients for joint radius dimension and joint surface orientation were also processed and reported in this paper. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objectives: To assess interexaminer agreement in a structured, manual, clinical examination of the neck. To correlate these data with the score in a functional questionnaire (a validated, French-language version of the neck pain and disability scale). Patients: Fifty-nine ambulatory patients (26 males and 33 females, mean ± SD age: 46.3 ± 12 yrs) with common neck pain but no radiation below the elbow. Methods: Two medical practitioners (a junior and a senior consultant) assessed neck rotation (in degrees) and the presence of pain during maximum neck flexion and extension, muscle palpation trapezius, levator scapulae, splenius cervicis, semispinalis) and cervical spine palpation. Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated for qualitative variables. Angular rotational values (as a continuous variable) were compared using the p coefficient. Pearson coefficient was used to correlate the number of tender spots to the results of the questionnaire. Results: There was no significant interexaminer difference (±10°) in the neck rotation measurement. Kappa was (i) 0.71 and 0.76 for pain in flexion or extension, respectively, (ii) 0.44 on average for palpation of various muscles and (iii) 0.53 on average for cervical spine palpation. The number of tender spots correlated strongly with the questionnaire score (Pearson's coefficient: 0.35; p = 0.007). Conclusion: The interexaminer agreement for our clinical examination was moderate. The number of tender spots correlated strongly with the functional impairment. Pain at the lower attachment of the levator scapulae was associated with dysfunction of the median or upper cervical spine. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  - Shoulder injuries are often related to rotator cuff muscles. Although there are various models for muscle force estimation, it is difficult to ensure that the results obtained with such models are reliable. The aim of the current study was to compare two models of muscle force estimation. Eight subjects, seven male and one female (mean age of 24 yr; mean height of 1,83 m), performed five isokinetic maximum concentric contractions of internal and external shoulder rotation. Two models with different algorithms were used. In both, the input data consisted of the measured internal rotation moment. Comparisons were made between the difference and the average results obtained with each model of muscle force estimation. There was reasonable agreement among the results for force between the two models for subscapularis, pectoralis major, and anterior deltoideus muscles results. Conversely, poor correlation was found for the latissimus dorsi, teres major, and middle deltoid. These results suggest that the algorithm structure might have a strong effect on muscle force estimation results. © 2009 Human Kinetics, Inc.

N2  - Exercises to retrain the orientation of the scapula are often used by physiotherapists to optimise shoulder girdle function. The movements and muscle activity required to assume this position have not yet been quantified. Further, patients often find this a difficult exercise to learn accurately, with no data being available on the accuracy of repeated performance. The primary objective of this study was to quantify the movements occurring during a commonly used scapular orientation exercise. The secondary objective was to describe the ability of subjects to learn this position after a brief period of instruction. A group of normal subjects (13 subjects; mean age 32, SD=9) were taught the scapular orientation exercise. Measurement of the position and muscle actions were made with a motion analysis system and surface electromyography. Further comparison was made of the accuracy of repeated trials. The most consistent movements were upward (mean=4°, SEM=0.9°) and posterior rotation (mean=4°, SEM=1.6°). All parts of the trapezius muscle demonstrated significant activity in maintaining the position while latissimus dorsi did not. Repeated trials showed that subjects were able to accurately repeat the movement without guidance. The key movements of, and immediate efficacy of a teaching approach for, scapular orientation have been established. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: Mouth-breathing is a common clinical condition among school-age children and some studies have correlated this condition with quality of life and postural alterations. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the orientation and position of the scapula, thoracic spine and head posture among mouth-breathing (MB) children and nasal-breathing (NB) children. Methods: Twenty-one male MB children and 21 male NB children between 8 and 12 years of age participated in the study. Data were obtained through a stereophotogrammetry system that uses passive markers over anatomical landmarks to capture the position of the segments. Internal rotation, upward rotation, anterior tilt, scapular elevation and abduction were measured bilaterally as well as thoracic kyphosis, forward head position and shoulder protrusion. Results: The MB children showed increased scapular superior position in relation to the NB group. No statistically significant differences were found between groups regarding the angular and linear measurements of the scapula. To verify reliability, three measurements were taken for each variable in the study. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) showed results above 0.8 for all the variables except for the internal rotation angle (I-Rot), below 0.5, probably due to uncertainty in the palpation of the inferior angle of the scapula. Ninety-five percent of the NB children and 58% among the MB children had been breastfed, this difference was statistically significant. There were statistically significant differences between groups regarding the domains of the Autoquestionnaire Qualité de Vie Enfant Imagé (AUQEI) scale and body mass index, which was higher among the NB children. Conclusions: MB children increased scapular superior position in comparison to NB children due probably to the position of forward head, leading to an alteration in the positioning of the mandible. The absence of significantly difference in posture pattern between groups in the present study could attributed to height-weight development in this age, as the posture of children changes in order to adapt to new body proportions, regardless of health status. The results observed in this study demonstrate the importance of using reliable measurements in the postural assessment of MB and NB children helping physical therapists to focus their strategies during rehabilitation in more specific conditions. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Disorders of the shoulder complex can be accompanied by changes in the movement pattern of the scapula. However, scapular motion is difficult to measure. A possible non-invasive method for dynamic three-dimensional kinematic measurement of the human scapula is the use of a marker cluster placed on the flat part of the acromion. A small light-weight acromion marker cluster (AMC) is presented in this study. In order to assess validity, kinematics obtained with the AMC were compared to simultaneous scapula locator (SL) recordings in a series of postures. The test/retest variability of replacement of the AMC, was also assessed. Measurement errors appeared to be sensitive for the plane of movement, the degree of humerus elevation, and replacement of the AMC. The AMC generally under-estimated scapula motion, compared to the SL. Some significant differences were found between the two methods, although the absolute differences were small (maximum mean difference 8.4° in extreme position). In humerus forward flexion and abduction the maximum mean differences were 6° or lower. In conclusion, the AMC is a valid method of measuring scapular movement during arm elevation that could be used in shoulder pathologies. Placement and planes of movement should be carefully considered and elevation of the humerus should not exceed 100°. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Clavicular crook plate is designed based on anatomic features of acromioclavicular joint, which matches clavicle appearance, and well attaches the shaft. Not passing through the joint, the internal fixation exhibits many advantages, such as convenient usage, reliable fixation and micromovement of fixed acromioclavicular joint. So the patients could move the joint early and avoid osteoarthritis. Allogenous tendon has abundant sources, simple sampling process, and short repairing duration and can reduce injury to patients. Cryopreserved allogenous tendon has low antigenicity and immunological refection, good histocompatibility. Reconstructed coracoclavicular ligament by allogenous tendon has good material intensity, and can meet the requirements of local stress, better substitute integrity and function of coracoclavicular ligament. Moreover, it has precise effect and simple operation. It acts as long-term fixator following plate removal, thus is important supplement of clavicular crook plate fixation. Clavicular crook plate fixation in combination with allogenous tendon transplantation reconstructs acromioclavicular joint stability, effectively provides early mechanical stability and subsequent biological stability, and maximizes restoration of acromioclavicular joint structure and function.

N2  - Physical therapy is an intervention commonly used in the treatment of subjects with frozen shoulder symptoms, with limited proven effect. The purpose of this study was to identify the kinematic features of patients with frozen shoulder who are more likely to respond to physical therapy. Thirty-four subjects presenting frozen shoulder syndrome were studied to determine altered shoulder kinematics and functional disability. Subjects received the same standardized treatment with passive mobilization/stretching techniques, physical modalities (i.e. ultrasound, shortwave diathermy and/or electrotherapy) and active exercises twice a week for 3 months. Initially, subjects were asked to perform full active motion in 3 tests: abduction in the scapular plane, hand-to-neck and hand-to-scapula. During the test, shoulder kinematics were measured using a 3-D electromagnetic motion-capturing system. In the initial and follow-up sessions, the self-reported Flexilevel Scale of Shoulder Function (FLEX-SF) was used to determine functional disability from symptoms. Improvement with treatment was determined using percent change in FLEX-SF scores over three months of treatment [(final score-initial score)/initial score×100, >20% improvement and <=20% nonimprovement]. Shoulder kinematics were first analysed for univariate accuracy in predicting improvement and then combined into a multivariate prediction method. A prediction method with two variables (scapular tipping >8.4° during arm elevation, and external rotation >38.9° during hand to neck) were identified. The presence of these two variables (positive likelihood ratio=15.71) increased the probability of improvement with treatment from 41% to 92%. It appears that shoulder kinematics may predict improvement in subjects with frozen shoulder syndrome. Prospective validation of the proposed prediction method is warranted. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - A comparison of electromyographic (EMG) activity of muscles between and within subjects, and during separate occasions of testing, requires normalization. The most common way for generating the reference level used for normalizing shoulder EMG data is with a maximum isometric voluntary contraction (MVIC). The purpose of this study was to develop a parsimonious set of standardized tests that generate an MVIC in all the major muscle groups of the shoulder. Twelve muscles of the dominant shoulder of 15 subjects were examined using a combination of surface and intramuscular electrodes during 15 tests. The results indicated that many tests maximally activated more than one muscle simultaneously. Four tests were identified as being sufficient for generating an MVIC in the 12 muscles examined and are recommended as the standard set for normalizing shoulder muscle EMG: abduction 90° with internal rotation ("empty can"), internal rotation in 90° abduction ("internal rotation 90°"), flexion at 125° with scapula resistance ("flexion 125°"), and horizontal adduction at 90° flexion ("palm press"). The use of these shoulder normalization tests will make comparisons between shoulder EMG studies more reliable. © 2008 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Purpose of the study: Scapula alata resulting from a deficient musculus serratus anterior leads to shoulder instability, pain and loss of elevation. Etiologies include fascioscapulohumeral dystrophy and lesion of the thoracicus longus nerve. Dynamic (muscle transfer) or static (scapulopexia or scapulothoracic arthrodesis) stabilization methods can be proposed. The purpose of this study was to assess fusion and function after eight scapulothoracic arthrodeses performed in five patients. We used cerclage with compression after intercostal avivement to increase the contact surface. Material and methods: This retrospective study included four men and one woman. Three patients had fascioscapulohumeral dystrophy who underwent bilateral arthrodeses and two patients with post-traumatic injury to one thoracicus longus nerve. All scapulothoracic joints were unstable; six were painful. There was a cosmetic prejudice in all cases. Preoperative function was 71 ± 6° antepulsion (range: 60-80°) and 71 ± 7° abduction (range: 60-80°). Postoperative assessment included: reduction of the scapula alata, gain in motion, Constant score (raw and weighed), subjective assessment of daily activity, complications, respiratory function in patients with double arthrodesis and bone fusion on the CT scan. Results: Patient follow-up was 21.5 months on average. The scapula alata was reduced in all cases. Mean gain in motion was 39 ± 21° antepulsion and 41 ± 26° abduction. The raw Constant score was 77.75 ± 11.4/100 and the weighted score was 81.5 ± 9.1/100. Daily activity was scored 100% in four of five patients. Complications were transient intercostal dysesthesia, mild exercise-induced pain, one pneumothorax which did not require drainage. There was no evidence of an impact on respiratory function. The control scans revealed fusion in five shoulders and nonunion in three. Discussion: Scapulothoracic arthrodesis enabled reduction of the scapula alata and improved shoulder function for elevation and daily activities. The gain in motion and Constant score were satisfactory and similar to other results in the literature. The main drawback was deficient external rotation. Pain was mild and resulted from the deafferentation. It resolved six months postoperatively. Secondary exercise-related pain was mild with little impact. Technically, authors have proposed using different ribs for the fusion, depending on the patient's morphology and searching for a good position for the scapula for external rotation. There have been few postoperative complications: we had one pneumothorax and no neurological, vascular or pulmonary complications. Our results are the first reporting CT fusion findings. Indirect signs of nonunion on plain x-rays reported in earlier studies are not fully reliable, since our CT scans demonstrated nonunion in three shoulders. The lack of fusion does not mean poor function, as was also noted by others, since function was improved (mean gain 27° flexion and 25° abduction). © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We report an alternative to the modified Weaver-Dunn technique that can achieve stable coracoclavicular reconstruction while avoiding sacrifice of the coracoacromial arch. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze the functional outcomes and radiographic features of patients treated with coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction with use of a proximally based conjoined tendon transfer. METHODS: The cases of thirty-eight patients with type-IV, type-V, and selected type-III acromioclavicular dislocations according to the Rockwood classification system, who were followed for an average follow-up of 38.7 months, were evaluated retrospectively. Transfer of the lateral half of the conjoined tendon to the distal aspect of the clavicle in a proximally based fashion, with additional coracoclavicular fixation, was performed in all patients. At the latest follow-up evaluation, radiographic analysis and the scores on the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Constant and Murley, and Simple Shoulder Test questionnaires were used to provide a final evaluation of shoulder function. The ability to return to work and the ability to return to sports were also recorded. RESULTS: At the time of final follow-up, the mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score was 91.4, with a mean pain score on the visual analog scale of 1.8, mean forward flexion of 148.2deg;, and mean external rotation of 38.0°. The mean Constant and Murley score was 90.6. The new number of positive answers on the Simple Shoulder Test was 10.9. The overall rate of satisfaction (an excellent or good result) was 89% (thirty-four patients). Thirty-five (92%) of the thirty-eight patients returned to their previous work, and thirty-two (84%) returned to their preinjury level of sports. CONCLUSIONS: The proximally based conjoined tendon transfer is a reliable treatment for a high-grade acromioclavicular dislocation. The lateral half of the conjoined tendon is a safe graft source with ample length, and this technique avoids sacrifice of the coracoacromial ligament. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV.

N2  - Lewis JS, Valentine RE. Intraobserver reliability of angular and linear measurements of scapular position in subjects with and without symptoms. Objective: To assess intraobserver reliability of angular and linear clinical measurements of scapular position. Design: Test-retest analyses. Setting: Outpatient department in National Health Service teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. Participants: Subjects (n=45) without symptoms (21 men, 24 women; age range, 23-56y) and 45 subjects (22 men, 23 women; age range, 19-84y) with shoulder symptoms (defined as pain in the C5-6 dermatome reproduced by shoulder movement and not reproduced with cervical movement). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) models 2,1 and 2,3, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and SE of measurements for 68% confidence and 2 SEs of measurement (for the 95% CI) for the bilateral angular measurements of scapular rotation and tilt, and the bilateral linear measurements of lateral scapular displacement (protraction) and vertical displacement (elevation). Results: For subjects without symptoms, ICC2,3 results ranged from .75 to .98. The 2 SE results for the angular movements ranged from 1.8° to 2.4° and from 0.4 to 1.0cm for the direct linear measurements. Subjects with symptoms: ICC2,3 results ranged from .61 to .98. The 2 SE results for the angular movements ranged from 1.4° to 2° and from 0.6 to 1cm for the direct linear measurements. Conclusions: Repeated-measure (ICC2,3) results were more reliable than single-measure (ICC2,1) results. Very good to excellent intraobserver reliability was demonstrated for the angular and linear measurements of interest in both shoulders of subjects with and without symptoms. The 2 SE results provide guidance about the error associated with the individual measurements and will assist the clinician determining whether a change in the static position of the scapula has occurred as a result of intervention or over time.

N2  - The shoulder is one of the most complex joints of the human body, mainly because of its large range of motion, but also because of its active muscular stabilisation. Actually, the numerous stabilizing muscles and degrees of freedom yield indeterminate biomechanical models. To solve this indeterminate, most models use reverse dynamics with a simplified ball-socket joint, preventing therefore the natural humerus translation. In this paper, an algorithm was specifically developed to solve the indeterminate problem by a feedback control of muscle activation, allowing the natural humerus translation. Abduction was considered in the scapular plane, accounting for the three deltoid parts and the rotator cuff muscles. The major aim of this study was to validate the numerical algorithm, which was here restricted to two-dimensions in order to compare the numerical solution to a known algebraic one. This comparison gave a relative error below 0.1%. The joint reaction force was comparable to other models and the humerus translation was in agreement with in vivo or in vitro studies. © 2007 IPEM.

N2  - Background In this paper we describe and assess the feasibility of a computer-assisted method which could be useful to investigate the mechanism of subacromial impingment of the shoulder. Methods The relationship between the infraspinatus and supraspinatus and the coracoacromial (CA) arch during passive elevation and abduction are described. The methodology is based on the use of a tracker for recording surfaces and passive movements and data elaboration using dedicated software. Results In four cadavers, we observed that the minimal distances between the rotator cuff insertions and CA arch were realized at 45° abduction between the acromion and infraspinatus, at 50-90° elevation between the acromion and supraspinatus and also at 45-70° abduction between the CA ligament and supraspinatus. This study showed that the proposed method is able to provide repeatable kinematic data (ICC ≥ 0.90), numerical anatomical data comparable with the literature and, moreover, individual measurements on the shoulder joint. Conclusions This preliminary results support the extension of the methodology to an in vivo protocol to be used during computer-assisted arthroscopic surgery. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Assessment of the glenohumeral joint relies upon a detailed, time-dependent history of the presenting complaint and a thorough examination of its subtle signs. As such, the complex is most appropriately approached as a unit, rather than as a discrete number of examinable components. However, understanding the interactions between these components means that a high level of skill is needed to adequately assess the joint, and learning these skills is compounded by the large number of eponymous tests described for examining separate elements. The stabilising mechanisms of the shoulder may crudely be classified as passive (non-contractile) or active (contractile) in function; this artificial distinction neglects the role of contractile tissue in maintaining stability whilst not contracting, but serves to facilitate understanding, and indeed categorise modes and methods of physical examination. Indeed, modes of failure are specific to these groupings. Determining the degree of instability caused by the passive stabilising mechanisms is commonly fraught with both intra- and inter-rater discrepancy, and as such, requires a great deal of experience to implement and interpret. However, an evidence-based approach to a clinical examination sequence can improve its predictive value. A critical review of the literature on examination of passive stabilising mechanisms is presented, followed by a distillation of current concepts resulting in the presentation of an evidence-based approach to examination that is practical, and can be implemented successfully by all involved in the rehabilitation process.

N2  - Background: Although nonoperative treatment is considered the standard of care for the treatment of grade I and II acromioclavicular joint injuries, the treatment of grade III injuries is controversial. There are as many methods of nonoperative treatment as there are for operative stabilization. That is why we conducted a literature research to find out the best evidence regarding the treatment of acute grade III acromioclavicular dislocation. Method: The research was limited to RCTs, systematic review and meta-analysis in the most representative databases. Even if research identifies more than 600 articles, only five were included in the study because there were RCTs, and systematic reviews, but no meta-analysis articles were found. Moreover, no meta-analysis was performed because of differences of data published in the three RCTs (different type of surgical treatments and different outcome measures). Results: From the literature evaluation, clinical results seem to be comparable between the operative and the conservative treatments, but complications are more evident in the surgery group. Since there is not a preponderance of positive papers showing the benefits of a surgical technique over conservative therapy, the nonoperative treatment is still considered a valid procedure in the grade III acromioclavicular separation. Conclusion: More prospective randomized studies using validated outcome measures are needed to identify the suitable operation techniques for the acute injuries. © Springer-Verlag 2008.

N2  - Multiple fixation options exist for coracoclavicular stabilization, but many are technically demanding and require hardware removal. In the study reported here, we reviewed a specific fixation technique that includes suture anchors moored in the base of the coracoid process. We retrospectively reviewed 24 consecutive cases of patients who underwent coracoclavicular stabilization with a suture anchor for a type III or type V acromioclavicular (AC) joint separation or a group II, type II or type V distal clavicle fracture. Eighteen of the 22 patients had full strength and painless range of motion (ROM) in the affected extremity by 3 months and at final follow-up (minimum, 24 months; mean, 39 months). Two patients were lost to follow-up. Four patients had early complications likely secondary to documented noncompliance. Two of these 4 patients underwent reoperation with a similar procedure and remained asymptomatic at a minimum follow-up of 15 months. One patient underwent osteophyte and knot excision 7 months after surgery and remained asymptomatic at 30 months. Our results suggest that coracoclavicular stabilization using a suture anchor technique is a safe and reliable method of treating acromioclavicular joint separations and certain distal clavicle fractures in the compliant patient.

N2  - Patients with rotator cuff tear arthropathy can be treated successfully with a reverse total shoulder prosthesis. In patients with significant glenoid bone loss, achieving stable bone fixation can be challenging, as the surgeon must know when bone grafting is necessary and when the plan to implant the reverse total shoulder prosthesis should be abandoned because of the likelihood of early implant loosening. The purposes of this study were (1) to determine the initial stability of a metal glenoid implant fixed in a glenoid with a central cavitary defect and (2) to determine whether an altered screw configuration would sufficiently resist implant micromotion and, thereby, allow bone ingrowth to occur. The Delta III reverse total shoulder glenoid implant was fixed into foam scapulae with a uniform density similar to normal glenoid bone density. The control group implants were fixed into foam scapulae without a glenoid defect, by use of the standard surgical technique for screw placement. The second group was fixed into foam scapulae containing a central cavitary glenoid defect, by use of the standard surgical technique for screw placement. The central cavitary defect was meant to simulate the bone loss typically found after the removal of a loose pegged glenoid implant, and it was created with a 4-pegged glenoid drill guide. A third group was fixed into foam scapula with a central cavitary glenoid defect, with an experimental screw configuration by use of a posterior screw directed toward the spine of the scapula and an anterior screw directed inferior to the central peg. All specimens were loaded with 500 cycles of 1 body weight (70 kg) to simulate the forces generated during arm elevation that occur during the first 3 months after surgery. Micromotion between the implant and the foam bone was measured with a digital video motion analysis system (accuracy, ± 2.6 μm). After loading of the implant with 70 kg for 500 cycles in the superior direction, the mean micromotion was 54 μm (SD, 22) in the control group, 159 μm (SD, 70) in the second group, and 86 μm (SD, 32) in the third group (P = 0.003). Fixing the posterior screw into the spine of the scapula and directing the anterior screw below the central peg decreased the micromotion of a metal glenoid implant fixed in a glenoid with a cavitary defect by 46% and, more importantly, reduced the micromotion below the critical threshold of 150 μm, which is necessary for bone ingrowth and long-term survival of the implant. © 2008 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Fish eye STUDY DESIGN: Clinical measurement validity study. Fish eye OBJECTIVES: To validate the measurement of the pectoralis minor muscle length using palpable landmarks and to explore the accuracy of the measurement using a clinical instrument. Fish eye BACKGROUND: The pectoralis minor is believed to adaptively shorten. Individuals with a relatively short pectoralis minor demonstrate scapular kinematic alterations that have been associated with shoulder impingement. Fish eye METHODS AND MEASURES: A 3-dimensional electromagnetic motion capture system was used to calculate the length of the pectoralis minor in 11 cadavers, using 2 measurement techniques. In addition, a measurement with the electromagnetic system using palpable landmarks was compared to a measurement with both a caliper and tape measure in vivo. Fish eye RESULTS: In cadavers, a measurement using palpable landmarks was determined to be a valid measure of the actual muscle length visualized and measured following dissection. There was a high intraclass correlation coefficient and a small root-mean-square error between these 2 measures. High intraclass correlation coefficients were also calculated in vivo when measurements with the clinical instruments were compared with the electromagnetic device measures. Fish eye CONCLUSION: A measurement using palpable landmarks for pectoralis minor length validly represents the muscle length in cadavers. A caliper or tape measure may be used clinically with high accuracy and may help clinicians determine the need for and the effectiveness of interventions for lengthening this muscle.

N2  - Fish eye STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. Fish eye OBJECTIVES: To determine the 3-dimensional motions occurring between the scapula relative to the clavicle at the acromioclavicular joint during humeral elevation in the scapular plane. Fish eye BACKGROUND: Shoulder pathology is commonly treated through exercise programs aimed at correcting scapular motion abnormalities. However, little is known regarding how acromioclavicular joint motions contribute to normal and abnormal scapulothoracic motion. Fish eye METHODS AND MEASURES: Thirty subjects (16 males, 14 females) participated. Subjects with positive symptoms on clinical exam or past history of shoulder pathology, trauma, or surgery were excluded. Electromagnetic surface motion analysis was performed tracking the thorax, clavicle, scapula, and humerus. Subjects performed 3 repetitions of scapular plane abduction. Passive motion data were also collected for scapular plane abduction from cadaver specimens. Data were analyzed using within-session reliability and descriptive statistics as well as repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to determine the effect of elevation angle from rest to 90° humeral elevation. Reliability was determined from repeated trials in the same session without removing sensors or redigitizing landmarks. Fish eye RESULTS: Angular values were highly repeatable within session (ICC>0.94; SEM, <2.3°). During active scapular plane abduction from rest to 90°, average acromioclavicular joint angular values demonstrated increased internal rotation (approximately 4.3°), increased upward rotation (approximately 14.6°), and increased posterior tilting (approximately 6.7°) (P<.05). Passive motions on cadavers demonstrated similar kinematic patterns. Fish eye CONCLUSIONS: Significant motion occurs at the acromioclavicular joint during active humeral elevation, contributing to scapular motion on the thorax. This information provides a foundation for understanding normal acromioclavicular joint motion as a basis for further investigation of pathology and rehabilitation approaches.

N2  - Acromioclavicular joint (AC) injuries are common in the young athletic population. There is general agreement that grade I and grade II separations are best managed nonoperatively, whereas grades IV to VI warrant surgical stabilization. In contrast, considerable controversy exists surrounding the best method of treatment for grade III AC separations. The trend in recent literature is toward the initial nonoperative management of these injuries. However, consideration of other factors such as type of sport, timing of injury relative to athletic season, or the throwing demands in an injured dominant arm may play a role in the decision to treat grade III injuries operatively or nonoperatively. We offer a protocol algorithm for treating grade III AC separations for managing this controversial injury. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to compare the postural characteristics of idiopathic scoliosis (IS) patients with different types of spinal curvature and to compare a motion capture and a sequential digitization technique to estimate the postural characteristics of the IS patients. METHODS: A total of 57 IS patients underwent a radiological, clinical, and postural geometric evaluations in an upright standing position as part of their regular follow-up. The posteroanterior radiograph of the trunk was used to measure the amplitude of spinal curvature. The postural evaluation was performed using a motion capture and sequential digitization technique providing the necessary 3-dimensional positions of anatomical landmarks. These landmarks were used to calculate postural parameters defining the position and orientation of the pelvis, shoulders, and shoulder blades. These measurements included lateral shift and angular measures of rotation and tilt. RESULTS: Significant differences in the frontal and transverse planes were found between the right thoracic (RTh), left thoracolumbar, and RTh-left lumbar (RThLL) patients. These characteristics were most prominent in the transverse plane for RTh patients, in the frontal plane for left thoracolumbar patients, and in the frontal and transverse planes for the RThLL lumbar patients. A strong positive intraclass correlation was also found between the parameters estimated with the motion capture system and with the sequential digitization system. CONCLUSIONS: Unique postural characteristics that are related to the type of the spinal curvature are evident in adolescents who have IS. Further work is necessary to assess how these measures may be used to monitor the progression of the spinal deformity. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Quantifying the postural alignment of IS patients using surface anthromopetric landmarks provides an opportunity to characterize the unique postural attributes that accompany each type of spinal curvature. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - Introduction: Three cases of successfully treated Rockwood type V acute acromioclavicular joint dislocation in high activity patients with modified (reinforced) coracoacromial ligament transfer were reported. Materials and methods: All patients were operated on within 3 weeks after injury. The operation is constructed with three parts, namely the coracoclavicular ligament repair with 2 suture anchors, the coracoacromial ligament transfer, and internal fixation of the acromioclavicular joint with short-hook-3-hole plate as a temporary support until ligaments heal. Postoperatively, the patient's shoulder is lightly immobilized with a sling. The sling is removed at the first postoperative day and the patient is allowed to begin circumduction exercises with a gradual increase. No overhead activities or full abduction was allowed until the hook plate removal at three months. Results: The mean follow-up duration was one year. Mean Constant score at a year was 95 out of a maximum of 100. Mean ASES score at a year was 29 out of a maximum of 30. Although follow-up was a short period, both subjective and objective assessments including X-ray evaluation were excellent. Conclusion: Combination of the repaired coracoclavicular ligament with the suture anchors and the transferred coracoacromial ligament must keep more rigid strength against redisplacement, and the temporary hook plate strongly prevents the ligaments from any stress during their healing period. Since reliable stability from the initial postoperative stage can ease mandatory limitation in daily activities earlier, this reinforced procedure may consequently help early reinstatements of the patients.

N2  - The acromiohumeral distance (AHD) measured on conventional, true anteroposterior radiographs taken with the patient standing and the arm held in neutral rotation can predict the presence or absence of a large, chronic rotator cuff tears, and narrowing of the acromiohumeral distance can predict irreparability of rotator cuff tears. The relation between AHD measured on conventional radiographs and the integrity of the rotator cuff tendons is well known. Conversely, the correlation between the AHD on conventional radiographs and that measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans is unknown. It has also not been determined which method correlates better with fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff muscles and might thereby be a better prognostic value for the outcome of rotator cuff repair. Conventional radiographs, plus MRI and or CT studies taken at the same time of patients with rotator cuff tears, shoulder instability, primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis, or idiopathic frozen shoulder, were randomly selected, and the AHD was measured both on conventional radiographs and on MRI or CT. The values were correlated with the stage of fatty degeneration of the rotator cuff muscles in the cases of rotator cuff tears. The AHD on conventional radiographs was larger than on MRI and CT, and correlation of the values measured (conventional radiography vs MRI and CT) could be demonstrated. For rotator cuff diseases, a significant but moderate correlation (r = 0.6; P < .05) between conventional and MRI was identified, and the conventional values were approximately 0.6 mm greater than the corresponding MRI values. It is, therefore, possible to use the AHD read on MRI or CT studies for prognostic reasons, provided the values obtained are converted accordingly and remembering that the correlation of the values is only moderate. © 2008 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Rotator cuff tears are a common injury that affect a significant percentage of the population over age 60. Although it is widely believed that the rotator cuff's primary function is to stabilize the humerus against the glenoid during shoulder motion, accurately measuring the three-dimensional (3D) motion of the shoulder's glenohumeral joint under in-vivo conditions has been a challenging endeavor. In particular, conventional motion measurement techniques have frequently been limited to static or two-dimensional (2D) analyses, and have suffered from limited or unknown in-vivo accuracy. We have recently developed and validated a new model-based tracking technique that is capable of accurately measuring the 3D position and orientation of the scapula and humerus from biplane X-ray images. Herein we demonstrate the in-vivo application of this technique for accurately measuring glenohumeral joint translations during shoulder motion in the repaired and contralateral shoulders of patients following rotator cuff repair. Five male subjects were tested at 3-4 months following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Superior-inferior humeral translation was measured during elevation, and anterior-posterior humeral translation was measured during external rotation in both the repaired and contralateral shoulders. The data failed to detect statistically significant differences between the repaired and contralateral shoulders in superior-inferior translation (p=0.74) or anterior-posterior translation (p=0.77). The measurement technique overcomes the limitations of conventional motion measurement techniques by providing accurate, 3D, in-vivo measures of glenohumeral joint motion during dynamic activities. On-going research is using this technique to assess the effects of conservative and surgical treatment of rotator cuff tears. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Shoulder pain is defined as chronic when it has been present for longer than six months. Common conditions that can result in chronic shoulder pain include rotator cuff disorders, adhesive capsulitis, shoulder instability, and shoulder arthritis. Rotator cuff disorders include tendinopathy, partial tears, and complete tears. A clinical decision rule that is helpful in the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears includes pain with overhead activity, weakness on empty can and external rotation tests, and a positive impingement sign. Adhesive capsulitis can be associated with diabetes and thyroid disorders. Clinical presentation includes diffuse shoulder pain with restricted passive range of motion on examination. Acromioclavicular osteoarthritis presents with superior shoulder pain, acromioclavicular joint tenderness, and a painful cross-body adduction test. In patients who are older than 50 years, glenohumeral osteoarthritis usually presents as gradual pain and loss of motion. In patients younger than 40 years, glenohumeral instability generally presents with a history of dislocation or subluxation events. Positive apprehension and relocation are consistent with the diagnosis. Imaging studies, indicated when diagnosis remains unclear or management would be altered, include plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, and computed tomography scans. Plain radiographs may help diagnose massive rotator cuff tears, shoulder instability, and shoulder arthritis. Magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography are preferred for rotator cuff disorders. For shoulder instability, magnetic resonance imaging arthrogram is preferred over magnetic resonance imaging. Copyright © 2008 American Academy of Family Physicians.

N2  - Objective: To compile and critique research on the diagnostic accuracy of individual orthopaedic physical examination tests in a manner that would allow clinicians to judge whether these tests are valuable to their practice. Methods: A computer-assisted literature search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases (1966 to October 2006) using keywords related to diagnostic accuracy of physical examination tests of the shoulder. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool was used to critique the quality of each paper. Meta-analysis through meta-regression of the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was performed on the Neer test for impingement, the Hawkins-Kennedy test for impingement, and the Speed test for superior labral pathology. Results: Forty-five studies were critiqued with only half demonstrating acceptable high quality and only two having adequate sample size. For impingement, the meta-analysis revealed that the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the Neer test was 79% and 53%, respectively, and for the Hawkins-Kennedy test was 79% and 59%, respectively. For superior labral (SLAP) tears, the summary sensitivity and specificity of the Speed test was 32% and 61%, respectively. Regarding orthopaedic special tests (OSTs) where meta-analysis was not possible either due to lack of sufficient studies or heterogeneity between studies, the list that demonstrates both high sensitivity and high specificity is short: hornblowers's sign and the external rotation lag sign for tears of the rotator cuff, biceps load II for superior labral anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions, and apprehension, relocation and anterior release for anterior instability. Even these tests have been under-studied or are from lower quality studies or both. No tests for impingement or acromioclavicular (AC) joint pathology demonstrated significant diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion: Based on pooled data, the diagnostic accuracy of the Neer test for impingement, the Hawkins-Kennedy test for impingement and the Speed test for labral pathology is limited. There is a great need for large, prospective, well-designed studies that examine the diagnostic accuracy of the numerous physical examination tests of the shoulder. Currently, almost without exception, there is a lack of clarity with regard to whether common OSTs used in clinical examination are useful in differentially diagnosing pathologies of the shoulder.

N2  - Proper scapular motion is crucial for normal shoulder mechanics. Scapular motion affects glenohumeral joint function during throwing, yet little is known about this dynamic activity. Asymptomatic subjects (10 male and 10 female), ages 21 to 45, were analyzed. Electromagnetic surface sensors on the sternum, acromion, and humerus were used to collect 3-D motion data during three trials of low-velocity throwing. Scapular angular position data were described for five predetermined events throughout the throw corresponding with classic descriptions of throwing phases, and trial-to-trial reliability was determined. ANOVA compared scapular angles across events. Subjects demonstrated good to excellent reliability between trials of the throw (ICC 0.74-0.98). The scapula demonstrated a pattern of external rotation, upward rotation (peak of approx. 40°), and posterior tilting during the initial phases of the throw, progressing into internal rotation after maximum humeral horizontal abduction. During the arm acceleration phase, the scapula moved toward greater internal rotation and began anteriorly tilting. At maximum humeral internal rotation, the scapula ended in internal rotation (55°), upward rotation (20°), and anterior tilting (3°). Significant differences in scapular position (p < 0.05) were identified across the throwing motion. Scapular data identify events in the throwing motion in which throwers may be more susceptible to shoulder pathologies related to abnormal scapular kinematics. © 2008 Human Kinetics, Inc.

N2  - Different clinical tests have been suggested in the literature as significant indicators of anterior shoulder instability. Sometimes patients with recurrent anterior shoulder instability may show some muscular guarding thus making the evaluation of specific clinical tests very difficult. These patients may also report a medical history with posterior shoulder pain that can be also elicited during some clinical manoeuvres. From September 2005 to September 2006 we prospectively studied patients who underwent an arthroscopic anterior capsuloplasty. Shoulder clinical examination was performed including anterior shoulder instability tests (drawer, apprehension and relocation tests). Furthermore the exam was focused on the presence of scapular dyskinesia and posterior shoulder pain. The patients were also evaluated with ASES, Rowe, SST (Simple Shoulder Test), Constant and UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) scoring system preoperatively and at the latest follow-up time. In the period of this study we observed 16 patients treated for anterior gleno-humeral arthroscopic stabilisation, who preoperatively complained also of a posterior scapular pain. The pain was referred at the level of lower trapezium and upper rhomboids tendon insertion on the medial border of the scapula. It was also reproducible upon local palpation by the examiner. Four of these patients also referred pain in the region of the insertion of the infraspinatus and teres minor. After arthroscopic stabilisation the shoulder was immobilised in a sling with the arm in the neutral rotation for a period of 4 weeks. A single physician supervised shoulder rehabilitation. After a mean time of 6.8 months of follow-up, all the shoulder scores were significantly improved and, moreover, at the same time the patients referred the disappearance of the posterior pain. Posterior scapular shoulder pain seems to be another complaint and sign that can be found in patients affected by anterior shoulder instability. It can also be related to eccentric work of posterior stabilising muscles of scapula during the altered biomechanics observed in case of anterior shoulder instability. This pain responds positively to surgical intervention showing that re-centring the humeral head probably also re-establishes the periscapular muscle-firing pattern with a mechanism mediated by the proprioceptive system.

N2  - Image-based Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (IBRSA) integrates 2D-3D image registration and conventional RSA. Instead of radiopaque RSA bone markers, IBRSA uses 3D CT data, from which digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) are generated. Using 2D-3D image registration, the 3D pose of the CT is iteratively adjusted such that the generated DRRs resemble the 2D RSA images as closely as possible, according to an image matching metric. Effectively, by registering all 2D follow-up moments to the same 3D CT, the CT volume functions as common ground. In two experiments, using RSA and using a micromanipulator as gold standard, IBRSA has been validated on cadaveric and sawbone scapula radiographs, and good matching results have been achieved. The accuracy was: |μ|<0.083 mm for translations and |μ|<0.023° for rotations. The precision σ in x-, y-, and z-direction was 0.090, 0.077, and 0.220 mm for translations and 0.155°, 0.243°, and 0.074° for rotations. Our results show that the accuracy and precision of in vitro IBRSA, performed under ideal laboratory conditions, are lower than in vitro standard RSA but higher than in vivo standard RSA. Because IBRSA does not require radiopaque markers, it adds functionality to the RSA method by opening new directions and possibilities for research, such as dynamic analyses using fluoroscopy on subjects without markers and computer navigation applications. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Fisheye STUDY DESIGN: Two-group, repeated-measures design. Fisheye OBJECTIVES: To determine whether manually repositioning the scapula using the Scapula Reposition Test (SRT) reduces pain and increases shoulder elevation strength in athletes with and without positive signs of shoulder impingement. Fisheye BACKGROUND: Symptom alteration tests may be useful in determining a subset of those with shoulder pathology who may benefit from interventions aimed at improving scapular motion abnormalities. Fisheye METHODS AND MEASURES: One hundred forty-two college athletes underwent testing for clinical signs of shoulder impingement. Tests provoking symptoms were repeated with the scapula manually repositioned into greater retraction and posterior tilt. A numeric rating scale was used to measure symptom intensity under both conditions. Isometric shoulder elevation strength was measured using a mounted dynamometer with the scapula in its natural position and with manual repositioning. A paired t test was used to compare the strength between positions. The frequency of a significant increase in strength with scapular repositioning, defined as the minimal detectable change (90% confidence interval), was also assessed. Fisheye RESULTS: Of the 98 athletes with a positive impingement test, 46 had reduced pain with scapular repositioning. Although repositioning produced an increase in strength in both the impingement (P = .001) and nonimpingement groups (P = .012), a significant increase in strength was found with repositioning in only 26% of athletes with, and 29% of athletes without, positive signs for shoulder impingement. Fisheye CONCLUSION: The SRT is a simple clinical test that may potentially be useful in an impairment based classification approach to shoulder problems. Fisheye LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnosis, Level 4.

N2  - Many surgical treatment options exist for cuff tear arthropathy, but in our opinion, the most reliable options include the unconstrained hemiarthroplasty and the reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Currently our indications for a hemiarthroplasty consist of a patient with a contained head, no superior migration (Seebauer 1A and 1B), no previous violation of the coracoacromial arch, reasonable preoperative range of motion, and younger age. On the other hand, we believe indications for a reverse total shoulder arthroplasty include the older patient with a pseudoparalytic shoulder, superior migration (Seebauer type 2A or 2B), and loss of the coracoacromial arch. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - A repeated-measures design was used to assess glenohumeral rhythm in 10 patients with shoulder impingement and 10 pain-free persons and to assess the effects of subacromial injection on glenohumeral rhythm within the impingement group. Scapular-plane anterior-to-posterior x-rays of the scapula and humerus were obtained at 5 angles of arm elevation (resting, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees). For the impingement group, x-rays were repeated after subacromial injection (10 mL of 1% lidocaine). No significant differences in glenohumeral rhythm were found between the impingement and control groups across all arm-elevation angles.

N2  - Muscles actuating the shoulder girdle are important for stabilizing the scapula and coordinating phased kinematics of the shoulder complex. If these muscles become weak or imbalanced, joint instability and injury may result. Reliable measurement of shoulder strength is thus important for prevention, diagnosis, and rehabilitation of shoulder problems. To date, studies quantifying the strength of the shoulder girdle are limited. The purpose of this work was to design and evaluate a custom apparatus and corresponding protocol for measuring maximal, voluntary, isometric strength of the shoulder girdle during various forms of shrugging exercise. A custom apparatus was constructed as a rigid frame with a vertical post supporting a seat, seat back, and horizontal beam. The beam extends laterally on either side beyond and around the shoulders of a seated subject. A pair of arm extension members pivots on the beam about an axis aligned with the shoulder flexion-extension axis. These members can be locked in place at any angle. Between them is mounted a force-sensing grip assembly, which can be adjusted proximally or distally to accommodate varying shoulder girdle positions. Subjects grasp the grip assembly handles with extended elbows and push or pull as forcefully as possible. Nine female and ten male subjects participated in a protocol using the apparatus to measure maximum isometric force generated at three positions each for elevation, depression, protraction, and retraction of the shoulder girdle (3 positions × 4 modes = 12 tests). A video motion capture system was used to measure shoulder girdle angles. The reliability of the approach was evaluated based on the repeatability of measured shoulder elevation angle, protraction angle, and total force over three days of testing. The apparatus performed well during the tests, providing a stable, rigid, yet adjustable platform for measuring shoulder girdle strength. Repeatability of force measurements was interpreted as very good to excellent, with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (2,1) values ranging from 0.83 to 0.95 for all tests except one (ICC=0.79). Repeatability of angle measurements was interpreted as good to excellent. For tests measuring elevation and depression strength, the ICC of elevation angle ranged from 0.85 to 0.89. For tests measuring protraction and retraction strength, the ICC of protraction angle ranged from 0.68 to 0.88. This type of apparatus could be an effective clinical tool for measuring strength in the shoulder girdle muscles. Use of the video motion capture system is optional. Copyright © 2007 by ASME.

N2  - Rotator cuff tears cause morphologic changes to cuff tendons and muscles, which can alter muscle architecture and moment arm. The effects of these alterations on shoulder mechanical performance in terms of muscle force and joint strength are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a three-dimensional explicit finite element model for investigating morphological changes to rotator cuff tendons following cuff tear. The subsequent objectives were to validate the model by comparing model-predicted moment arms to empirical data, and to use the model to investigate the hypothesis that rotator cuff muscle moment arms are reduced when tendons are divided along the force-bearing direction of the tendon. The model was constructed by extracting tendon, cartilage, and bone geometry from the male Visible Human data set. Infraspinatus and teres minor muscle and tendon paths were identified relative to the humerus and scapula. Kinetic and kinematic boundary conditions in the model replicated experimental protocols, which rotated the humerus from 45° internal to 45° external rotation with constant loads on the tendons. External rotation moment arms were calculated for two conditions of the cuff tendons: intact normal and divided tendon. Predicted moment arms were within the 1-99% confidence intervals of experimental data for nearly all joint angles and tendon sub-regions. In agreement with the experimental findings, when compared to the intact condition, predicted moment arms were reduced for the divided tendon condition. The results of this study provide evidence that one potential mechanism for the reduction in strength observed with cuff tear is reduction of muscle moment arms. The model provides a platform for future studies addressing mechanisms responsible for reduced muscle force and joint strength including changes to muscle length-tension operating range due to altered muscle and tendon excursions, and the effects of cuff tear size and location on moment arms and muscle forces. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - A recent paper has described a new functional method, the symmetrical centre of rotation (SCoRE), for locating joint centre position [Ehrig, R.M., Taylor, W.R., Duda, G.N., Heller, M.O., 2006. A survey of formal methods for determining the centre of rotation of ball joints. Journal of Biomechanics 39 (15), 2798-2809]. For in vitro analyses, the SCoRE method showed better precision than helical axis (HA) or sphere fitting methods. Despites HA determination is very sensitive to small angular velocity, the International Society of Biomechanics has recommended to use HA for locating the glenohumeral joint centre. This paper aims at comparing the SCoRE method with the HA method for locating in vivo the glenohumeral joint centre according to the movement characteristics. Nine subjects performed 10 cycles of three different movements at two different velocities. For each test (combination of movements) the location of the centre of rotation was estimated with both methods (SCoRE and HA). Analyses focused on the 3D location of the glenohumeral joint centre and on the repeatability of location (standard deviation). This study showed that SCoRE and HA methods yielded the same GH location. Nevertheless, with SCoRE method, the location of the glenohumeral joint centre was different according to the test. This study evidenced that the SCoRE method was more precise than HA method (error of 3 mm versus 4.6 mm) and that the GH location with the SCoRE method was not affected by movements with slow velocities. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background: Posterior shoulder tightness with subsequent loss of humeral internal rotation range of motion has been linked to upper extremity lesions in overhead athletes. A valid clinical assessment is necessary to accurately identify posterior shoulder tightness as a contributor to injury. Purpose: To describe a modified supine assessment of posterior shoulder tightness by establishing the reliability, precision, clinical accuracy, and validity of the assessment. Study Design: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Intrasession, intersession, and intertester reliability and precision were established by comparing the commonly used side-lying assessment of posterior shoulder tightness and the described modified supine assessment. Clinical accuracy of both methods was obtained using an electromagnetic tracking device to track humeral and scapular motion. Construct validity was established by identifying posterior shoulder tightness in a group of overhead athletes (baseball pitchers and tennis players) reported in the literature to have limited humeral internal rotation and posterior shoulder tightness. Results: The side-lying intrasession intraclass correlation coeffecient (standard error of measurement), intersession intraclass correlation coeffecient (standard error of measurement), and intertester intraclass correlation coeffecient (standard error of measurement) were 0.83 cm (0.9), 0.42 cm (1.7), and 0.69 cm (1.4), respectively. The supine intrasession intraclass correlation coeffecient (standard error of measurement), intersession intraclass correlation coeffecient (standard error of measurement), and intertester intraclass correlation coeffecient (standard error of measurement) were 0.91° (1.1°), 0.75° (1.8°), and 0.94° (1.8°), respectively. In side-lying, the clinical accuracy expected was 0.9 ± 0.6 cm of error while, when measured supine, it was 3.5° ± 2.8° of error. Both assessments resulted in minimal scapular protraction (∼3.5°). Between groups, baseball pitchers and tennis players had significantly less internal rotation range of motion (P <.0001) and greater posterior shoulder tightness (P =.004) when measured in supine, but not in side-lying (P =.312). Conclusion: Both methods resulted in good clinician accuracy and precision, suggesting that both can be performed accurately. The supine method can be assessed more reliably than side-lying between both sessions and testers. Clinical Relevance: Clinicians may want to consider use of the supine method given the higher reliability, validity, and similar precision and clinical accuracy. © 2007 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.

N2  - Background: We report an alternative to the modified Weaver-Dunn technique that can achieve stable coracoclavicular reconstruction while avoiding sacrifice of the coracoacromial arch. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze the functional outcomes and radiographic features of patients treated with coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction with use of a proximally based conjoined tendon transfer. Methods: The cases of thirty-eight patients with type-IV, type-V, and selected type-III acromioclavicular dislocations according to the Rockwood classification system, who were followed for an average follow-up of 38.7 months, were evaluated retrospectively. Transfer of the lateral half of the conjoined tendon to the distal aspect of the clavicle in a proximally based fashion, with additional coracoclavicular fixation, was performed in all patients. At the latest follow-up evaluation, radiographic analysis and the scores on the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Constant and Murley, and Simple Shoulder Test questionnaires were used to provide a final evaluation of shoulder function. The ability to return to work and the ability to return to sports were also recorded. Results: At the time of final follow-up, the mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score was 91.4, with a mean pain score on the visual analog scale of 1.8, mean forward flexion of 148.2°, and mean external rotation of 38.0°. The mean Constant and Murley score was 90.6. The new number of positive answers on the Simple Shoulder Test was 10.9. The overall rate of satisfaction (an excellent or good result) was 89% (thirty-four patients). Thirty-five (92%) of the thirty-eight patients returned to their previous work, and thirty-two (84%) returned to their preinjury level of sports. Conclusions: The proximally based conjoined tendon transfer is a reliable treatment for a high-grade acromioclavicular dislocation. The lateral half of the conjoined tendon is a safe graft source with ample length, and this technique avoids sacrifice of the coracoacromial ligament. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level IV.

N2  - Smith J, Dahm DL, Kotajarvi BR, Boon AJ, Laskowski ER, Jacofsky DJ, Kaufman KR. Electromyographic activity in the immobilized shoulder girdle musculature during ipsilateral kinetic chain exercises. Objective: To quantify the electromyographic activity in the shoulder girdle musculature during ipsilateral kinetic chain exercises performed in a shoulder immobilizer in asymptomatic men. Design: Descriptive. Setting: Motion analysis laboratory at a tertiary care center. Participants: Five asymptomatic male volunteers, ages 24 to 32 years. Intervention: Fine-wire (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, upper subscapularis) and surface (deltoids, trapezii, biceps, serratus anterior) electrodes recorded electromyographic activity from each muscle during a split-stance cross-body rotation (twisting to the opposite side at high, mid, and low levels), split stance attempted ipsilateral floor touch, and attempted overhead reach. All movements were initiated from the immobilized scapula and were tested with and without a combined step. Main Outcome Measure: Mean peak normalized (percentage of maximum voluntary contraction [%MVC]) electromyographic activity of each muscle during each exercise. Results: For all exercises, biceps and infraspinatus activity remained low (<10% MVC), whereas upper subscapularis activity was moderate to very high (29%-68% MVC). Supraspinatus activity was low (<20% MVC) for all motions except the attempted overhead reach (23% MVC). Serratus electromyographic activity was less than 20% of MVC for all motions and was most responsive to added stepping (23%-136% MVC without stepping vs 24%-199% MVC with stepping). Cross-body rotation at lower heights progressively increased serratus activity while decreasing supraspinatus, upper trapezius, and anterior deltoid activity. Conclusions: Based on these electromyographic data, selected kinetic chain exercises could potentially be implemented during periods of shoulder immobilization. All exercises examined could potentially be safe after superior labral anteroposterior repair, but not after subscapularis repair. All exercises, with the exception of the attempted overhead reach, could potentially be safe after supraspinatus repair, with or without concomitant infraspinatus repair. Early activation of the serratus anterior could potentially be achieved by performing cross-body rotations, particularly at lower heights. © 2007 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

N2  - Objective: To verify if stabilizing the scapulothoracic joint without arthrodesis could lead to functional improvement of shoulder range of motion and clinical improvement of winged scapula, we incorporated four additional patients into our previous analysis to determine if the results obtained were long lasting, and to compare this fixation with the other techniques described in the literature, balancing the benefits with the complications. Design: A retrospective study. Participants: Thirteen patients with bilateral winged scapula affected by facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Nine of these patients had been analyzed in our previous study. Methods: Patients were operated on by bilateral fixing of the scapula to the rib cage using metal wires without arthrodesis (scapulopexy). Results: All patients experienced improvement in active range of motion of the shoulder and all of them had clinical improvement with complete resolution of the winged scapula. In all twenty-six surgical interventions of scapulopexy, a stable and long-lasting fixation of the scapula to the rib cage was achieved. The complications strictly associated to the surgical technique encountered were one pneumothorax, which was resolved spontaneously, and one wire breakage without trauma. Average follow-up was 10 years (range, 3 to 18 years). Conclusion: The scapulopexy used in this extended series of patients consisted of repositioning the scapula and fixing it to four ribs by using metal wires without performing arthrodesis.This technique has a low rate of complications, is reproducible, safe and effective, resulting in clinical and functional improvement. ©2007 Marshfield Clinic.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical effect of clavicular hook plate in treating Neer type II fracture of distal clavicle. METHODS: From March 2004 to April 2006, 15 patients suffering from Neer type II fracture of distal clavicle were treated with clavicular hook plate, including 12 males and 3 females with an average age of 39 years (range, 17-69 years). All patients had acute injury, including accident injury (8 cases) and falling injury (7 cases). The results were assessed by the JOA method. RESULTS: The wounds healed by first intention. No early complications were found. All patients were followed up for an average of 16.4 months (range, 9-34 months). The mean JOA score was 93.1. The mean pain parameter was 28.0, the fuction was 18.8 and the range of motion was 26.3. The X-ray films showed that bony union was obtained in all patients after 3-6 months, and the mean healing period was 3.9 months. No acromioclavicular subluxation and dislocation occurred. CONCLUSION: The principal advantages of this method are reliable fixation and early rehabilitation. It is necessary to protect rotator cuff and tissues behind acromioclavicular joint and remove the plate as soon as possible after bony union.

N2  - There have been several reports about the clavicular and acromioclavicular motion, but a precise motion has been unknown. The purpose of this study was to analyze the 3D kinematics of the clavicle and acromioclavicular joint during arm abduction, using 3D MR images obtained by a vertically open MRI. Seven subjects participated in this investigation, which included 14 shoulders. From a seated position, we obtained MR images of their shoulder in seven abducted positions of the arm in the coronal plane. We evaluated the 3D movements of each bone in the shoulder using the volume-based registration technique, and analyzed the clavicular positions relative to the lung and the scapular positions relative to the clavicle. During arm abduction, the clavicular motion relative to the lung showed 30.6° retraction, 7.3° elevation, and 33.2° posterior axial rotation. During arm abduction, the scapular motion relative to the clavicle showed 15.6° protraction, 21.5° upward rotation, and 22.2° posterior tilting. This study succeeded in describing the 3D clavicular and acromioclavicular motion including th axial rotation of the clavicle, and it revealed that both motions had large degrees of rotations. © 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society.

N2  - Fisheye STUDY DESIGN: Case report. Fisheye BACKGROUND: Based on our assumption that subtle deviations in the precision of shoulder movement cause tissue injury, we have developed a set of movement-related diagnoses for shoulder problems. The purposes of this case report are to (1) illustrate the use of a movement system impairment (MSI) diagnosis in a patient with shoulder pain, (2) illustrate how the MSI diagnosis guided treatment prescription, and (3) describe the outcomes of treatment based on a MSI diagnosis for shoulder impingement. Fisheye CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 46-year-old female with recurrent right-shoulder pain of 2 months' duration. Initially she reported that her pain was constant but varied in intensity and had increased gradually over time. Shoulder pain limited her ability to bicycle and perform reaching movements. The systematic clinical examination for assessing the patient's preferred alignment and movements included items related to pain, alignment, movement, muscle length, muscle strength, and function. Based on the examination, the MSI diagnosis was humeral anterior glide with scapular downward rotation. The treatment focused on correction of her shoulder alignment, functional movements, and associated impairments of muscle function. The patient was seen 4 times in 6 weeks. Fisheye OUTCOMES: The patient was pain free with all activities at 1 month and there was no recurrence of symptoms 3 years after the last physical therapy visit. Fisheye DISCUSSION: A MSI diagnosis of humeral anterior glide with scapular downward rotation guided physical therapy treatment and resulted in positive short- and long-term outcomes.

N2  - Background. Abnormal scapular displacements during arm elevation have been observed in people with shoulder impingement syndrome. These abnormal scapular displacements were evaluated using different methods and instruments allowing a 3-dimensional representation of the scapular kinematics. The validity and the intrasession reliability have been shown for the majority of these methods for healthy people. However, the intersession reliability on healthy people and people with impaired shoulders is not well documented. This measurement property needs to be assessed before using such methods in longitudinal comparative studies. The objective of this study is to evaluate the intra and intersession reliability of 3-dimensional scapular attitudes measured at different arm positions in healthy people and to explore the same measurement properties in people with shoulder impingement syndrome using the Optotrak Probing System. Methods. Three-dimensional scapular attitudes were measured twice (test and retest interspaced by one week) on fifteen healthy subjects (mean age 37.3 years) and eight subjects with subacromial shoulder impingement syndrome (mean age 46.1 years) in three arm positions (arm at rest, 70° of humerothoracic flexion and 90° of humerothoracic abduction) using the Optotrak Probing System. Two different methods of calculation of 3-dimensional scapular attitudes were used: relative to the position of the scapula at rest and relative to the trunk. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error of measure (SEM) were used to estimate intra and intersession reliability. Results. For both groups, the reliability of the three-dimensional scapular attitudes for elevation positions was very good during the same session (ICCs from 0.84 to 0.99; SEM from 0.6° to 1.9°) and good to very good between sessions (ICCs from 0.62 to 0.97; SEM from 1.2° to 4.2°) when using the method of calculation relative to the trunk. Higher levels of intersession reliability were found for the method of calculation relative to the trunk in anterior-posterior tilting at 70° of flexion compared to the method of calculation relative to the scapula at rest. Conclusion. The estimation of three-dimensional scapular attitudes using the method of calculation relative to the trunk is reproducible in the three arm positions evaluated and can be used to document the scapular behavior. © 2007 Roy et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background: Supraspinatus deficiency is the most frequent and important problem associated to rotator cuff pathologies. It reduces shoulder stability and can lead to osteoarthritis. The goal of this study was to develop a numerical model of the shoulder to analyse the biomechanical consequences of this pathology. Methods: A 3D finite element model of the shoulder was developed from a normal cadaver specimen. It included the scapula, the humerus and the major abduction muscles. Instead of the usual ball-socket assumption, which prevents the natural translation of the humerus, shoulder stability was actively achieved by muscles. A feedback algorithm was developed to synchronise muscle forces during abduction. The numerical algorithm was validated against an algebraic model, and the calculated muscle moment arms were compared to the literature. Two cases were considered: a normal shoulder and the same one without supraspinatus. Findings: For the normal shoulder, the model predicted the initial upward migration of the humeral head. The maximal humerus translation occurred at 30° of abduction and was 0.75 mm above its ideal centered position. Without supraspinatus, it was 1.6 times higher and the contact point in the glenoid fossa was more eccentric. For the normal shoulder, the maximal glenohumeral force was 81% of the body weight, at 82° of abduction. Without supraspinatus, it increased by 8%, while the increase of muscle forces was 30%. Interpretation: Supraspinatus deficiency increased the upward migration of the humerus, the eccentric loading, and the joint and muscle forces, which may cause a limitation of active abduction and degenerative glenohumeral changes (osteoarthritis and the rotator cuff tear). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Surgical reconstruction of severe brachial plexus injuries includes nerve grafting and neurotization techniques of the musculocutaneous nerve (MCN) to recover elbow flexion. In treating recurrent anterior shoulder instability, knowledge of the topography of the MCN is important for the margin of safety available during dissection. The present study evaluates the origin and course of the MCN and its branches, and their relationships to bone landmarks. Twelve unembalmed cadavers (50-82 years old) were dissected. A histological study of the MCN and the coracobrachialis muscle (CB) was also carried out. The mean distance (±SD) of the MCN from the coracoid process to the origin, points of entry to, and exit from the CB were 2.9 ± 0.5 cm, 7.7 ± 2.5 cm, and 11.6 ± 0.8 cm, respectively. The first two findings were also validated during surgical approaches to the shoulder in 59 subjects. The mean distance of the MCN from the acromion to the origin, points of entry to, and exit from the CB were 6.4 ± 0.3 cm, 7.7 ± 0.8 cm, and 10.4 ± 1.9 cm, respectively. The mean length of the MCN from its origin to the points of entry to and exit from the CB were 6.7 ± 1.6 cm and 11.0 ± 1.0 cm, respectively. The mean length of the MCN inside the muscle was 4.4 ± 1.9 cm. The distance from the coracoid process to the point of entry to the CB and the length of the MCN inside the muscle were inversely related (P < 0.05). The distance from the coracoid process to the point of exit of the MCN was positively correlated with the length of the nerve within the CB (P < 0.05). Histology showed that, during the intramuscular course of the MCN, the epineurium is composed of 4-5 concentrically arranged lamina of connective tissue which shows different dispositions along the circumference of the nerve trunk. On the ventral and dorsal aspects of the nerve the lamina are closely packed, but on the medial and lateral sides they are separated by thin layers of adipose tissue. This uneven disposition of the adipose tissue gives the epineurium an oval profile in transverse section (mean circular factor 0.8). The arrangement of the fibroadipose tissue sheaths may be compared to a "telescope" and may allow compliance between variations of length of CB and the constant course of the MCN. Clinically, a decrease in this "sliding system" may expose the nerve to mechanical effects of muscle contraction, with the possibility of a compression syndrome. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Transverse plane rotations of the upper body are often estimated during the golf swing. The aim of this study was to determine the agreement between upper body alignments measured using markers attached to the thorax and markers on the acromion process during the golf drive. Three-dimensional coordinate data from nine markers were collected (300 Hz) during eight golf drives for 10 participants. The transverse plane alignment of the upper body was calculated using three techniques: inter-acromion vector, thorax vector, and Cardan angles. Agreement between the methods was then assessed using intra-class correlation and 95% limits of agreement. Our results suggested that the thorax vector can be used to provide an accurate estimation of thorax alignment at all stages of the golf swing (R ≥ 0.97, systematic difference <1.0°, random difference <3.8°). The inter-acromion vector gave an accurate estimation of thorax alignment at address (R = 0.90, systematic difference = 0.0°, random difference = 4.3°) but it should not be used to estimate thorax alignment at the top of the backswing (R = 0.32, systematic difference = -16.0, random difference 8.7°) or impact (R = 0.90, systematic difference = -5.1°, random difference = 8.3°) during the golf drive.

N2  - The clinical tolerance of rotator cuff tears is extremely variable, so the question is, what is the role of the deltoid in the shoulder stability? First of all, ex vivo experiments are necessary to analyse its effect. The aims of this study were: (1) to propose a testing protocol to measure the glenohumeral joint kinematics during the abduction motion by pulling on the deltoid without constraining the humerus and (2) to evaluate the repeatability of the 3D measurements. Six fresh-frozen anatomic specimens were tested. The kinematics follow-up of the osseous parts was carried out using an optoelectronic system (Polaris® NDI, Canada). The abduction motion is realized by the pulling on anterior and medium fibers of the deltoid. For a 25 mm displacement, the range of motion: for the abduction was 24° to 30.5°, for the flexion was 1.5° to -30.5° (extension), for the medio-lateral rotation was 12° (lateral rotation) to -5° (medial rotation). For a displacement of the whole acromion-clavicle between 0 and 25 mm, the three humeral head translations were less than 5 mm. The three rotations and three translations were (with SD 95%): abduction: 0.5°, flexion: 1°, medio-lateral rotation: 1.5°, three translations: 0.5° mm. The results showed a very high repeatability of the values. Results suggest that the deltoid alone can realize a motion of lateral elevation with a good stability in the glenohumeral joint as shown by the slight translation motion of the head and the value reproducibility. The protocol can be used to validate a finite element model of the glenohumeral joint. © Springer-Verlag 2007.

N2  - Non-invasive dynamical measurements of 3D scapular motion can be performed easily by attachment of a 6 DOF electromagnetic receiver onto the skin above the acromion. To quantify the introduction of possible errors due to skin displacement, we assessed 3D scapular positions on n = 8 subjects by both tripod and skin-fixed method. Error analysis included the variables method (tripod, skin-fixed simultaneously with tripod, separate skin-fixed at 0 and 0.25 Hz of elevation speed), plane of elevation (0° and 90°) and observation (receiver replacement: n = 3). Inter-individual 'group' differences depended on elevation plane and showed an average underestimation of scapular rotation of 6.5° (worst case 13°) using the skin-fixed method. Only the group RMSE, not the individual RMSE, could be successfully lowered using linear regression (to about 2°). Inter-trial reliability (RMSE <3.24°, ICC>0.94) and RMSE between 0 and 0.25 Hz recordings (about 2.5°) were satisfactory. Intra-observer RMSE after replacement of the skin-fixed receiver was 5°. The skin-fixed method is suitable for dynamic recordings of scapular rotations; however, measurements are precise only when the acromion receiver is not replaced. Combined with a relatively low accuracy, we conclude that the skin-fixed method should be used only in combination with tripod 'calibration'. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - The goal of this study was to measure 3-dimensional shoulder motion by use of a direct invasive technique during 4 different arm movements in healthy volunteers. Eight subjects with healthy shoulders were recruited. Optoelectronic marker carriers (ie, infrared light-emitting diodes) were mounted on bone pins, which were inserted into the lateral scapular spine. Subjects performed 4 different arm movements while the motion was being recorded by a precision optoelectronic camera. Joint angles were calculated in 3 dimensions. Intraclass correlation coefficients and root-mean-square differences were calculated as measures of reliability. During abduction, the scapula tipped posteriorly (44° ± 11°), rotated upward (49° ± 7°), and rotated externally (27° ± 11°). For reaching, the scapula consistently rotated upward (17° ± 3°) and rotated internally (18° ± 6°) whereas tipping was generally less than 10° (5° ± 2°). Overall, the range of scapular movement for the hand behind the back was small and variable, with most rotations not exceeding 15°. For horizontal adduction, the scapula tipped anteriorly (8° ± 3°), rotated upward (5° ± 2°), and rotated internally (27° ± 6°). These scapular rotations provide normative data that will be useful for diagnosing scapular dysfunction. © 2007 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Kaltenborn's convex-concave rule is a familiar concept in joint treatment techniques and arthrokinematics. Recent investigations on the glenohumeral joint appear to question this rule and thus accepted practice guidelines. An evidence-based systematic review was conducted to summarize and interpret the evidence on the direction of the accessory gliding movement of the head of the humerus (HOH) on the glenoid during physiological shoulder movement. Five hundred and eighty-one citations were screened. Data from 30 studies were summarized in five evidence tables with good inter-extracter agreement. The quality of the clinical trials rated a mean score of 51.27% according to the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale (inter-rater agreement: κ = - 0.6111). Heterogeneity among studies precluded a quantitative meta-analysis. Weighting of the evidence according to Elwood`s classification and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research classification guidelines indicated that evidence was weak and limited. Poor methodological quality, weak evidence, heterogeneity and inconsistent findings among the reviewed studies regarding the direction of translation of the HOH on the glenoid, precluded the drawing of any firm conclusions from this review. Evidence, however, indicated that not only the passive, but also the active and control subsystems of the shoulder may need to be considered when determining the direction of the translational gliding of the HOH. The indirect method, using Kaltenborn's convex-concave rule as applied to the glenohumeral joint, may therefore need to be reconsidered. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study is to describe and evaluate the validity/accuracy of the computerized system PosturePrint for measuring head posture. Methods: Computer analysis was compared with 125 measured positions of a mannequin head in 5 degrees of freedom. For each mannequin position, 3 digital photographs were obtained (left lateral, anteroposterior, and right lateral) and were processed through the PosturePrint computer system. For the head analysis, a headgear with 3 reflective markers was placed on a subject; and there were additional click-on markers at the ear tragus, upper lip, acromioclavicular joints, and episternal notch. Head postures were calculated as lateral translation (Tx), lateral flexion (Rz), axial rotation (Ry), flexion-extension (Rx), and anterior-posterior translation (Tz). For an error analysis, PosturePrint algorithm calculations were compared with the true mannequin head positions. Furthermore, average head posture was determined in student volunteers (n = 40). Results: Mean computational errors were Rx = 1.3° (SD 0.6°) and Tz = 1.1 mm (SD 0.5 mm) for sagittal displacements and Ry = 1.1° (SD 0.7°), Rz = 0.6° (SD 0.4°), and Tx = 1.1 mm (SD 0.5 mm) for frontal view displacements. For the normal group, mean head displacements were 1.1° or less for all rotations and 1 mm or less for lateral translations (Tx); and forward head posture (Tz) averaged 3 cm. Conclusion: From the mannequin positions, small mean errors indicate that the PosturePrint system is accurate. In the future, statistical research determining the correlation between head displacements, neck pain, function, and health status should be performed. © 2007.

N2  - Increasingly complex models of the neck neuromusculature need detailed muscle and kinematic data for proper validation. The goal of this study was to measure the electromyographic activity of superficial and deep neck muscles during tasks involving isometric, voluntary, and reflexively evoked contractions of the neck muscles. Three male subjects (28-41 years) had electromyographic (EMG) fine wires inserted into the left sternocleidomastoid, levator scapulae, trapezius, splenius capitis, semispinalis capitis, semispinalis cervicis, and multifidus muscles. Surface electrodes were placed over the left sternohyoid muscle. Subjects then performed: (i) maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) in the eight directions (45 deg intervals) from the neutral posture; (ii) 50 N isometric contractions with a slow sweep of the force direction through 720 deg; (iii) voluntary oscillatory head movements in flexion and extension; and (iv) initially relaxed reflex muscle activations to a forward acceleration while seated on a sled. Isometric contractions were performed against an overhead load cell and movement dynamics were measured using six-axis accelerometry on the head and torso. In all three subjects, the two anterior neck muscles had similar preferred activation directions and acted synergistically in both dynamic tasks. With the exception of splenius capitis, the posterior and posterolateral neck muscles also showed consistent activation directions and acted synergistically during the voluntary motions, but not during the sled perturbations. These findings suggest that the common numerical-modeling assumption that all anterior muscles act synergistically as flexors is reasonable, but that the related assumption that all posterior muscles act synergistically as extensors is not. Despite the small number of subjects, the data presented here can be used to inform and validate a neck model at three levels of increasing neuromuscular-kinematic complexity: muscles generating forces with no movement, muscles generating forces and causing movement, and muscles generating forces in response to induced movement. These increasingly complex data sets will allow researchers to incrementally tune their neck models' muscle geometry, physiology, and feedforward/feedback neuromechanics. Copyright © 2007 by ASME.

N2  - Background. No three-dimensional (3-D) data exist on the influence of motion velocity on scapular kinematics. The effect of arm elevation velocity has been studied only in a two-dimensional setting. Methods. Thirty healthy subjects performed dominant (right) arm elevation in two planes, sagittal and frontal, and at slow and fast self-selected arm speed. Scapular orientation and humeral elevation were measured at 30 Hz recording frequency with use of a 6-degree-of-freedom electromagnetic system (Polhemus Fastraka). Motion was computed according to the International Society of Biomechanics standards. Scapular orientation was also determined with the arm held in different static positions. Findings. We obtained a full 3-D kinematic description of scapula achieving a reliable, complex 3-D motion during humeral elevation and lowering. The maximal sagittal arm elevation showed a characteristic "M"-shape pattern of protraction/retraction curve. Scapular rotations did not differ significantly between slow and fast movements. Moreover, protraction/retraction and tilt angular values did not differ significantly between static and dynamic tasks. However, scapular lateral rotation values differed between static and dynamic measurements during sagittal and frontal arm elevation. Lateral scapular rotation appears to be less in static than in dynamic measurement, particularly in the sagittal plane. Interpretation. Interpolation of statically recorded positions of the bones cannot reflect the kinematics of the scapula. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - There are many articles that support stretching, strengthening, good nutrition, hydration, rest, and ergonomics along with many other concepts that may be helpful in preventing repetitive stress injuries. The most conclusive literature proposes early recognition of onset of symptoms, and immediate reduction or cessation of the causal activity. This is not well accepted by the musician, because this means an interruption of practice and performance. Just like any worker or athlete at risk for RSI, however, the musician must learn to recognize early signs and take the steps to limit damage to muscular and neural tissues. More studies are needed to provide evidence for effective treatment and prevention of RSI. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The repeatability of shoulder instability clinical examinations has been reported to be poor, producing a large range of translations. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of providing the clinician with joint orientation feedback on the magnitude and precision of glenohumeral joint kinematics. A 6-degree of freedom magnetic tracking system was used to determine the kinematics of the humerus with respect to the scapula (n=8 cadaveric shoulders). The joints were preconditioned with simple loading tests five times. At 60° of glenohumeral abduction and 0° of flexion/extension, a clinician then applied an anterior and posterior load to the humerus until a manual maximum simulating a simple translation test (STT) was achieved at 0, 30, and 60° of external rotation with and without angular orientation feedback of the humerus with respect to the scapula. The precision for the external rotation was within 4.3° for the feedback group and 17.5° for the no feedback group over all external rotations. For achieving the target external rotation of 30°, there was a significant difference in precision between the feedback and no feedback groups (p<0.05). The magnitudes of the anterior translations were 18.2±5.3, 15.5±5.1, and 9.9±5.5 mm for the feedback group and 19.3±6.6, 17.5±4.9, and 11.5±5.3 mm for the no feedback group, at 0, 30, and 60° of external rotation, respectively. There was a significant difference in the precision of anterior translation at 30 and 60° of external rotation for 4 of 8 specimens (p<0.05). Significant differences in the precision of the posterior translation was only detected at 0° of external rotation for 3 of 8 specimens (p<0.05). Based on the data obtained, providing orientation feedback to a clinician performing a simulated STT results in increased precision for not only the target external rotations but also the resulting glenohumeral translations. While providing feedback may be a necessary step to achieving precise results for experimental studies, the magnitudes of translations in the anterior and posterior directions were relatively similar for the feedback and no feedback states indicating little benefit for clinical examinations. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Context: Increased contracture of the dominant posterior shoulder in throwing athletes has been associated with the development of altered shoulder rotational motion as well as several shoulder conditions. Clinicians must be able to accurately and reliably measure posterior shoulder contractures during the evaluation of such athletes in order to provide appropriate treatment. Objective: To evaluate the reliability and validity of assessing posterior shoulder contracture by measuring supine glenohumeral (GH) horizontal adduction. Design: Descriptive with repeated measures. Setting: The biomechanics laboratory at Illinois State University (Normal, IL) and the athletic training room in Surprise, AZ. Patients or Other Participants: Twenty-four shoulders were tested in 12 subjects (age = 21.9 ± 4.3 years, height = 175.0 ± 10.0 cm, mass = 82.4 ± 19.1 kg) for determination of reliability, and 46 shoulders were tested in 23 professional baseball pitchers (age = 21.25 ± 1.66 years, height = 190.0 ± 5.0 cm, mass = 88.45 ± 6.99 kg) for determination of validity. Main Outcome Measure(s): We examined intratester and intertester reliability over 3 testing sessions by having 2 examiners measure GH horizontal adduction with the subject in a supine position with the scapula stabilized. To determine the validity and clinical usefulness of this measurement, we examined the relationship between GH horizontal adduction motion and internal shoulder rotational motion among a group of baseball pitchers. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients were high for intratester (0.93, SEM = 1.64°) and intertester (0.91, SEM = 1.71°) measurements. This measurement was also shown to have a moderate to good relationship with lost internal shoulder rotational motion (r = .72, P = .001) of the dominant arm among the baseball pitchers. Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, we found that measuring GH horizontal adduction with the subject supine and the scapula stabilized is a reliable and valid technique for assessing posterior shoulder contracture. © by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss the reconstruction of severe neck contracture by transplanting combined scapular/parascapular bilobar flaps, and the probability to reestablish three-dimensional movement of the neck. METHODS: From January 2003 to November 2004, 9 cases of sustained severe neck contractures were treated (aged 9-32 years). The combined scapular/parascapular bilobar flaps, pedicled on the circumflex scapular vascular bundle, were microsurgically used to cover the soft tissue defect after excision of hypertrophic scar and release of contracture. The maximum size of the combined bilobar flap was 20 cm x 8 cm to 20 cm x 11 cm, while the minimum one was 15 cm x 4 cm to 15 cm x 6 cm. RESULTS: The combined scapular/parascapular flaps were successfully used to treat 9 cases of severe neck contracture. All patients were satisfied with the final functional and aesthetic results. There was no recurrence during 3-9 months follow-up for 8 patients. The cervicomental angle was 90-105 degrees. CONCLUSION: The combined bilobar scapular/parascapular flap, providing a large area of tissue for coverage in three dimensions with a reliable blood supply by only one pedicle anastomosis during operation, is a good option for reconstruction of the severe neck contracture.

N2  - Shoulder motion is complex and significant research efforts have focused on measuring glenohumeral joint motion. Unfortunately, conventional motion measurement techniques are unable to measure glenohumeral joint kinematics during dynamic shoulder motion to clinically significant levels of accuracy. The purpose of this study was to validate the accuracy of a new model-based tracking technique for measuring three-dimensional, in vivo glenohumeral joint kinematics. We have developed a model-based tracking technique for accurately measuring in vivo joint motion from biplane radiographic images that tracks the position of bones based on their three-dimensional shape and texture. To validate this technique, we implanted tantalum beads into the humerus and scapula of both shoulders from three cadaver specimens and then recorded biplane radiographic images of the shoulder while manually moving each specimen's arm. The position of the humerus and scapula were measured using the model-based tracking system and with a previously validated dynamic radiostereometric analysis (RSA) technique. Accuracy was reported in terms of measurement bias, measurement precision, and overall dynamic accuracy by comparing the model-based tracking results to the dynamic RSA results. The model-based tracking technique produced results that were in excellent agreement with the RSA technique. Measurement bias ranged from -0.126 to 0.199 mm for the scapula and ranged from -0.022 to 0.079 mm for the humerus. Dynamic measurement precision was better than 0.130 mm for the scapula and 0.095 mm for the humerus. Overall dynamic accuracy indicated that rms errors in any one direction were less than 0.385 mm for the scapula and less than 0.374 mm for the humerus. These errors correspond to rotational inaccuracies of approximately 0.25 deg for the scapula and 0.47 deg for the humerus. This new model-based tracking approach represents a non-invasive technique for accurately measuring dynamic glenohumeral joint motion under in vivo conditions. The model-based technique achieves accuracy levels that for surpass all previously reported non-invasive techniques for measuring in vivo glenohumeral joint motion. This technique is supported by a rigorous validation study that provides a realistic simulation of in vivo conditions and we fully expect to achieve these levels of accuracy with in vivo human testing. Future research will use this technique to analyze shoulder motion under a variety of testing conditions and to investigate the effects of conservative and surgical treatment of rotator cuff tears on dynamic joint stability.

N2  - Background. Patients with full thickness rotator cuff tears typically demonstrate an increase in scapular motion, both in the clinic and under controlled laboratory conditions. To better understand the mechanisms behind this pattern of motion, we propose a suprascapular nerve block as an appropriate model of dysfunction of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus, which are the two tendons most commonly affected in cuff tear patients. Methods. Healthy subjects underwent testing for 3D scapular kinematics with a Polhemus magnetic tracking device and isometric force measurements during external rotation. A suprascapular nerve block was then performed with the injection of lidocaine into the suprascapular notch of each subject. Scapular kinematics and isometric force measurements were repeated after confirmation of the block. Findings. The nerve block resulted in no significant changes in clavicular rotations and scapular posterior tilting. However, there was a significant increase in scapular external rotation and upward rotation. While kinematic changes returned to baseline within 25 min of the block, force measurements did not return to baseline until 75 min post-block. Interpretation. The results of this study, especially those for upward rotation, are in general agreement with what has been found for patients with rotator cuff tears. While the supraspinatus and infraspinatus do not directly control the movement of the scapula, they appear to result in a compensatory change in scapular motion. Although more work needs to be done, it appears that abnormal scapular motion patterns observed in patients with cuff tears may therefore be compensatory in nature. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - This study aims to investigate how quadriplegic patients with a C6-C7 spinal lesion coordinate their upper limb to extend the elbow despite the paralysis or weakness of the triceps brachii, and what is the effect of a surgical musculotendinous transfer. For this purpose, aiming movements in a wide workspace were recorded in seven healthy subjects and in patients with incomplete (five cases) or complete (eight cases) triceps paralysis and after musculotendinous transfer (eight cases). We used four electromagnetic field sensors to quantify hand trajectory and to compute the angles describing the rotations at the scapula, glenohumeral joint, elbow and wrist (10 degrees of freedom). Extent and smoothness of the hand trajectories and hand velocity profiles were surprisingly similar between healthy subjects and quadriplegic patients. The reduction of elbow extension observed in patients was compensated by rotations distributed across several degrees of freedom including the scapula. Principal components analysis showed that the joint rotations could be summarized by an additive combination of two synergies, respectively orientating and stretching out the limb, which explained similar amounts of variance in healthy subjects and in patients. The participations of degrees of freedom in the synergies were roughly similar in the different groups of subjects, the main difference concerning scapular medial-lateral rotation, which seems to be critical in patients with a complete triceps paralysis. This demonstrates that elbow extension in quadriplegic patients is due to anticipated mechanical interaction coupling between upper limb segments. We propose that the persisting (incomplete paralysis) or restored (musculotendinous transfer) elbow extensor strength may act by stabilizing the elbow. This counterintuitive preservation of limb kinematics for horizontal aiming movements in quadriplegic patients despite the drastic changes in muscle action provoked by paralysis and/or by surgery strongly suggests that the motor system does not primarily control forces but the morphological aspects of movement, via joint rotation synergies. © 2005 IBRO.

N2  - Knowledge of the morph-physiological conditions of young athletes, it of the utmost importance for planning better trainning programs and to identify those characteristics that lead to a better performance. This paper aims to classify a group of 114 male Venezuelan swimmers of the Miranda State contingent, aged between 7.00 and 18.99 years old, based on their anthropometric characteristics and skeletal maturity. For this purpose multivariate methods: Analysis of Principal Components (APC) and the Automatic Classification were employed. Anthropometric variables followed the International Society for the Advancement of Kinantropometry (ISAK) guidelines. Skeletal maturity and five indexes of body composition: brachial, crural, cormic and acromiale-iliac indexes, were additionally considered in the analysis. Three groups emerged very well defined and homogenous within and between groups. The first group identifies the younger swimmers with the smallest values in corporal dimensions. The second group comprises those swimmers characterized fundamentally by a greater development of the bicrestal diameter. In the third group, greater values of the anthropometrical variables were found, that shaped the typical profile of the swimmers, mainly characterized by a trapezoidal trunk. Most of the swimmers are advanced in skeletal age related to chronological age. This clustering of the swimmers permits a suitable way to identify the bio-morphological characteristics of the athletes. © 2006 Univarsidad del Zulia.

N2  - The acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) is a common cause of shoulder pain. As the majority of shoulder pain originates from the glenohumeral joint and subacromial region, ACJ is often neglected. For this reason the glenohumeral joint and subacromial space and also ACJ must be examined routinely in patients with shoulder pain. Examination of the ACJ with clinical tests, diagnostic injection and proper imaging methods should provide correct diagnosis easily.

N2  - Context: Using constant, variable, and absolute error to measure movement accuracy might provide a more complete description of joint position sense than any of these values alone. Objective: To determine the effect of loaded movements and type of feedback on shoulder joint position sense and movement velocity. Design: Applied study with repeated measures comparing type of feedback and the presence of a load. Setting: Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Twenty healthy subjects (age = 27.2 ± 3.3 years, height = 173.2 ± 18.1 cm, mass = 70.8 ± 14.5 kg) were seated with their arms in a custom shoulder wheel. Intervention(s): Subjects internally rotated 27° in the plane of the scapula, with either visual feedback provided by a video monitor or proprioceptive feedback provided by prior passive positioning, to a target at 48° of external rotation. Subjects performed the internal rotation movements with video feedback and proprioceptive feedback and with and without load (5% of body weight). Main Outcome Measure(s): High-speed motion analysis recorded peak rotational velocity and accuracy. Constant, variable, and absolute error for joint position sense was calculated from the final position. Results: Unloaded movements demonstrated significantly greater variable error than for loaded movements (2.0 ± 0.7° and 1.5 ± 0.4°, respectively) (P < .05), but there were no differences in constant or absolute error. Peak velocity was greater for movements with proprioceptive feedback (45.6 ± 2.9°/s) than visual feedback (39.1 ± 2.1°/s) and for unloaded (47.8 ± 3.6°/s) than loaded (36.9 ± 1.0°/s) movements (P < .05). Conclusions: Shoulder joint position sense demonstrated greater variable error unloaded versus loaded movements. Both visual feedback and additional loads decreased peak rotational velocity. © by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.

N2  - Background: In recent years, transfer of the spinal accessory nerve to suprascapular nerve has become a routine procedure for restoration of shoulder abduction. However, the operation via the traditional supraclavicular anterior approach often leads to partial denervation of the trapezius muscle. The purpose of the study was to introduce transfer of the spinal accessory nerve through dorsal approach, using distal branch of the spinal accessory nerve, to repair the suprascapular nerve for restoration of shoulder abduction, and to observe its therapeutic effect. Methods: From January to October 2003, a total of 11 patients with a brachial plexus injury and an intact or nearly intact spinal accessory nerve were treated by transferring the spinal accessory nerve to the suprascapular nerve through dorsal approach. The patients were followed up for 18 to 26 months [mean (23.5 ± 5.2) months] to evaluate their shoulder abduction and function of the trapezius muscle. The outcomes were compared with those of 26 patients treated with traditional anterior approach. And the data were analyzed by Student's test using SPSS 10.5. Results: In the 11 patients, the spinal accessory nerves were transferred to the suprascapular nerve through the dorsal approach successfully. Intact function of the upper trapezius was achieved in all of them. In the patients, the location of the two nerves was relatively stable at the level of superior margin of the scapula, the mean distance between them was (4.2 ± 1.4) cm, both the nerves could be easily dissected and end-to-end anastomosed without any tension. During the follow-up, the first electrophysiological sign of recovery of the infraspinatus appeared at (6.8 ± 2.7) months and the first sign of restoration of the shoulder abduction at (7.6 ± 2.9) months after the operation, which were earlier than that after the traditional operation [(8.7 ± 2.4) months and (9.9 ± 2.8) months, respectively; P<0.05]. The postoperative shoulder abduction was 62.8° ± 12.6° after transfer of the spinal accessory nerve, better than that after the traditional (51.6° ± 15.7°). All the 11 patients could extend and externally rotate the shoulder almost normally. Conclusions: The accessory nerve transfer through dorsal approach is a safe and reliable procedure for the treatment of brachial plexus injury. Its postoperative effect is confirmed, which is better than that of the traditional operation. ©2005-2008 Chinese Medical Journal, All Rights Reserved.

N2  - In this contribution the authors refer to the importance of so called therapeutic climbing for physiotherapy. The contribution is supplemented with a pilot study using polyelectromyographic examination for documentation of intensity of integration in selected stabilizers of shoulder blade during isometric contraction in selected positions of upper extremity characteristic for assuming balanced body position on the climbing wall. In spite of considerable inter-individual variability probably reflecting differences in individual mode of stabilization of shoulder girdle, the results showed considerable activation of middle and lower portion of trapezoid muscle in assuming the balanced body position at the climbing wall in selected positions of the arm and indicated possible direction of using the therapeutic climbing in therapy.

N2  - Context: Glenohumeral and scapular upward rotation are important factors in functional upper extremity motion. Objectives: To determine how different amounts of glenohumeral rotation (internal, external, and neutral) affect scapular upward rotation. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Independent variables were the amounts of internal, external, and neutral glenohumeral rotation. The dependent variable was the amount of scapular upward rotation. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: 40 subjects who were right-hand dominant, sedentary, and age 16 to 35 years. Main Outcome Measures: An inclinometer assessed scapular upward rotation with the 3 different positions of glenohumeral rotation in each 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of humeral elevation in the scapular plane. Results: Scapular upward rotation tended to increase with glenohumeral internal and external rotation, compared with neutral rotation in each degree of humeral elevation. This trend was seen on both right and left sides. Conclusions: Scapular upward rotation at different levels of humeral elevation in the scapular plane was affected by the positions of glenohumeral rotation. © 2006 Human Kinetics, Inc.

N2  - Background. Recording movement of the scapula by non-invasive techniques is fraught with technical difficulty. One convenient method involves placing a single marker on the skin overlying the acromion. The purpose of this study was to compare translatory discrepancies between marker and underlying bone for seven markers affixed to the skin overlying different parts of the scapula. Methods. The markers were small plastic spheres filled with machine oil, clearly visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), placed over seven loci of the scapula, including the acromion, spine, medial border, lateral border, and inferior angle. Nine healthy men participated, assuming three positions in the MRI apparatus: (1) arm at the side of the trunk (starting position); (2) arm in full elevation over the head; and (3) hand placed behind the back at the thoracolumbar area. Visible markers and three loci of the scapula itself were digitized on each MRI scan, enabling calculation of changes in location of each marker relative to the scapula between the starting position and either of the other two positions. Results. Among the seven loci examined, the marker placed atop the acromion deviated least from its target, 39 ± 1mm (mean ± standard deviation) for full elevation and 15 ± 1mm for moving the hand behind the back. Markers along the medial border and at the inferior angle exhibited relatively large deviations, on the order of 8mm for full elevation and 3mm for moving the hand behind the back. Conclusions. For the two movements studied, involving full range of motion in the shoulder complex, translation of the scapula is most accurately recorded if the marker is placed over the acromion, but the systematic error is too large for such tracking to be deemed precise. © The Japanese Orthopaedic Association.

N2  - Several methods have been developed recently for the analysis of the spatial motion of the scapula and the arm, whereby the spatial position of shoulder bones is determined in static conditions by interrupting motion. The authors have developed a 3D motion analysis method recording scapular motion in progress with appropriate accuracy in the course of arm movements of various degrees. The objective of this study is to explore the applicability of the method developed, as well as to compare it with and verify it by other methods developed earlier. The position and displacements of shoulder bones were determined on 30 shoulders of 15 healthy people. The newly developed measurement method is based on the mechanical basic principle stating that the position and motion of a rigid body - in this case, the bones (segments) forming the shoulder joint - can be calculated at any moment from the spatial coordinates of three points of a segment and any changes thereof in the course of motion. Ultrasound-based triplets providing the three points (fundamental points) by a segment as required for measurement were fixed on the sternum (modeling the trunk), the clavicle, the acromion (modeling the scapula), the upper arm, and the lower arm. The position of the sixteen anatomical points involved in the study were determined by an ultrasound-based pointer in the local coordinate system specified by the fundamental points before starting measurements. The ZEBRIS ultrasound-based motion analysis system was used for measuring the spatial coordinates of triplets in the course of continuous motion. The spatial coordinates of the designated anatomical points can be calculated by the method of triangulation. The method was calibrated by a ZEBRIS mapping (3DCAD) software commercially available, and the measurement error rate of the method was determined by statistical calculations. On the basis of calibration and error calculations it could be established that the accuracy and the reproducibility of the method were appropriate, in accordance with the limit values to be found in the literature. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To determine the effect of scapular fatigue on shoulder and elbow kinematics and accuracy. Design: Pretest-posttest. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: 30 healthy men. Interventions: Subjects performed seated overhead throws into a target before and after a standardized scapular-muscle-fatigue protocol. Main Outcome Measurements: Shoulder and elbow kinematic data were analyzed during throwing. Scapular upward rotation was measured (0°, 45°, and 90° humeral elevation in scaption) with an inclinometer. Throwing accuracy was measured as mean error distance from the target (cm). Results: After fatigue, there was a significant increase in total elbow motion (12% more in cocking phase, P < .05) and elbow velocity in the follow-through phase (average and maximum into flexion, P < .05). Throwing accuracy decreased 26% after fatigue (P < .05). Conclusions: Scapular-muscle fatigue results in compensatory motions at the elbow that might affect performance and contribute to elbow pathologies. © 2006 Human Kinetics, Inc.

N2  - A case of an angulated, greenstick fracture of the scapula mimicking scapular winging in a skeletally immature 12-year-old boy is described. The bony deformity was visualized with plain radiography. CT was helpful in exclusion of a thoracic injury or an underlying neoplasm. Closed reduction yielded satisfactory results. Based on this 1 case only, we recommend consideration of closed reduction in children with significantly angulated greenstick fractures of the scapula without underlying thoracic pathology.

N2  - A dynamic shoulder dynamometer has been designed to develop a vertical downward force over a measured range of motion, i.e. scapular elevation. The dynamometer is force-controlled to apply a required force within the range of motion. Calibration procedures were performed to assess the reliability of the force and displacement measurements. The system is designed to operate in isometric or eccentric conditions. For eccentric exercise the dynamometer has, for the first time, provided possibilities to elicit delay onset muscle soreness in shoulder muscles. In future, the apparatus will enable investigations of sensory-motor interactions in the shoulder region. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: This study evaluates the results of the new surgical treatment of complete acromioclavicular (ac) dislocations using coracoclavicular (cc) fixation with a shape memory metal C-hook implant. Materials and methods: Fifteen patients were prospectively analyzed. They all had a Tossy III ac dislocation due to trauma. The ac ligament was reinserted using a surgical bone anchor, and the position of the joint was restored by fixing it with a C-hook. After 3 months the C-hook was removed. Functional status, symptom severity, X-rays and patient satisfaction were analyzed during clinical control visits. The follow-up time was 1 year. Results: At 12 weeks, full shoulder function had been achieved by 93% of the patients. The final control visit showed full recovery of active ROM in all patients. Two patients had mild pain during certain movements. X-rays showed the precise anatomical position of ac joint with no statistically significant differences compared to the healthy side. Patient contentment was excellent in 14 cases and satisfactory in one case. The average sick-leave was 58 days, including the removal operation. Minor osteolysis of the clavicle was noticed in two patients. Conclusion: The new C-hook implant provides accurate anatomical reduction, conserves the articular surfaces and enables fast functional recovery with excellent patient contentment. Technically, the implant is easy to use. Based on this study, the C-hook presents a reliable novel treatment option in surgical ac repair. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

N2  - Study Design: Psychometric evaluation of a cross-sectional survey. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of reliability and validity of the Penn Shoulder Score (PSS). Background: Shoulder outcome measures are used to assess patient self-report levels of pain, satisfaction, and function. The PSS is a 100-point shoulder-specific self-report questionnaire consisting of 3 subscales of pain, satisfaction, and function. This scale has been utilized in the literature. However, the measurement properties of reliability and validity, including responsiveness, of the PSS subscales and overall scale need to be established. Methods and Measures: Patients (n = 40) with shoulder disorders undergoing a course of outpatient physical therapy completed the PSS at initial visit and again within 72 hours to assess test-retest reliability. The Constant Shoulder Score (CSS) and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Score (ASES) were also completed at the initial visit and compared to the PSS to assess convergent construct validity. A separate cohort of patients (n = 109) completed the PSS at initial visit and 4 weeks later. These scores were used to assess internal consistency and responsiveness. Results: Reliability analysis revealed a test-retest ICC2,1 of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.89-0.97). Internal consistency analysis revealed a Cronbach alpha of 0.93. The standard error of measurement (SEM) was ± 8.5 scale points (based on a 90% CI) and the minimal detectable change (MDC) was ± 12.1 scale points (based on a 90% CI). The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for improvement was 11.4 points. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients between the PSS and the CSS and ASES were 0.85 and 0.87, respectively. Responsiveness analysis revealed an effect size of 1.01 and a standardized response mean of 1.27. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated that the PSS is a reliable and valid measure for reporting outcome of patients with various shoulder disorders.

N2  - Ultrasonography (US) has proved to be useful diagnostic tool in patients with shoulder pain and/or limited range of motion. It allows careful assessment of a wide range of changes involving many different anatomic structures of the shoulder girdle, such as the rotator cuff tendons (tendonitis, tendon tears and calcific deposits), the long head of the biceps tendon (tenosynovitis, tendonitis, tears, rupture and displacement), the bursae (bursitis), the soft tissues of the gleno-humeral (synovial proliferation, joint effusion) and acromioclavicular joints (synovial proliferation and joint effusion). In addition, it is also a reliable tool in the evaluation of bony profiles detecting the presence of erosions and osteophytes. The use of high quality equipment and the application of a standard scanning protocol are mandatory for reliable US assessment of shoulder pathology.

N2  - Study Design: Nonexperimental. Objective: To investigate the intertester and intratester reliability of a battery of function-related tests in patients with shoulder pathologies and associated reduced range of motion. Background: A battery of function-related tests has the potential to complement assessment of functional limitation in patients who have shoulder pathologies. Methods and Measures: Three function-related tests (hand to neck, hand to scapula, and hand to opposite scapula) were conducted on 46 patients with shoulder pathologies, and 46 age- and gender-matched control subjects. The tests were performed by 2 independent physiotherapists to test intertester reliability. Intratester reliability was examined by investigating the reproducibility of the tests performed twice, with 3 to 5 days between tests, by the same physiotherapist. Comparison of the scores on the function-related tests between patients and controls was evaluated. A correlation matrix was calculated to test the level of association among the tests. Results: Intratester and intertester reliability on the 3 tests (weighted K) varied from 0.83 to 0.90. The patient's test performances were decreased in comparison to the control group. The correlation matrix demonstrated a level of associations among the 3 tests varying from r = 0.64 to r = 0.66. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that function-related tests are reliable and could be used in clinical practice to document reduced function of the shoulder. The level of association among the tests indicates that each test measured different aspects of shoulder function.

The modified SAT is designed to assess the contribution of scapular motion to shoulder pain. Background: Abnormal scapular motion has been implicated in different shoulder disorders. However, there is a lack of clinical evaluation tools to assess the scapular component of shoulder dysfunction. Methods and Measures: Forty-six subjects who were referred to physical therapy for treatment of various shoulder pathologies were recruited for this study. The modified SAT was performed on each participant by 2 different examiners. Percent agreement and kappa coefficient were utilized to determine interrater reliability of the modified SAT. Results: The kappa coefficient and percent agreement were .53 and 77%, respectively, when the test was performed in the scapular plane, and .62 and 91%, respectively, when the test was performed in the sagittal plane. Conclusions: The modified SAT possesses acceptable interrater reliability for clinical use.

N2  - Purpose of the study: Aim of this retrospective study was to analyze outcome in 23 cases of Delta III reverse ball-and-socket total shoulder prosthesis for acute complex fractures of the proximal humerus in an elderly population with poor bone quality. In such a population, this procedure could escape the difficulties of a reliable and efficient refixation of the tubercles. Material and methods: From 1993 to 2000, 23 Delta III prostheses were implanted by a single operator for acute injury: 18 three-part and four-part fractures and 5 fracture-dislocations. The study population included two men and 21 women, mean age 75 years, 10 dominant sides. Surgery was performed under general anesthesia in the semi-sitting position via the anterolateral approach without osteotomy of the acromion, with 10-20° retroversion of the humeral stem (except in one shoulder) and cement fixation in two. For five shoulders, the tubercles could be re-fixed. Postoperative physiotherapy was not possible in all patients. Outcome was assessed with the Constant score and with ap and lateral Lamy radiographs. Results: Seven patients died so the series included sixteen cases for analysis. Complications were: reflex sympathetic dystrophy (n=2), postoperative Acinetobacer infection (n=1) requiring revision to clean and drain allowing preservation of the prosthesis, and early postoperative anterior dislocation (n=1) (10° stem anteversion) with surgical revision to re-orient the stem. At mean follow-up of 86 months, the Constant score was 60 points (contralateral shoulder 83 points). Outcome, influenced in case of re-fixation of the tubercles, was good for pain (14.1), activity (13.3), strength (16.1), anterior elevation (6.5), and abduction (6.5), but very poor for external (1.1) and internal (2.4) rotations. The radiographs showed: aseptic glenoid loosening (n=1) at 12 years with surgical revision in 2005 with Constant score at 6 months follow-up of 48 points, inferior scapular notching (n=11) according the the Nérot classification (six stage 1, four stage 2, one stage 3, at 2, 4.3 and 5 years follow-up), inferior spurs (n=9) appearing at mean 2.5 years follow-up (stable after emergence without clinical impact), proximal humeral resorption (n=4) (medially for three at mean 8 year follow-up and one laterally at 10 years), and a humeral radiolucent line (n=1) at 5 years follow-up. Discussion: For acute complex fractures of the proximal humerus in elderly subjects with poor bone quality, when an efficient and reliable re-fixation of the tubercles is difficult or impossible, reverse ball-and-socket shoulder prosthesis is a possible alternative providing good functional outcome except for rotations but with the risk of inferior scapular notching. Although not problematic in the mid term, these notches may contribute to glenoid loosening with bone loss in the long-term. Nevertheless, this procedure seems to improve the status of patients with such fractures. © 2006. Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Study Design: Single-group repeated-measures design. Objectives: To investigate the ability of the wall slide exercise to activate the serratus anterior muscle (SA) at and above 90° of humeral elevation. Background: Strengthening of the SA is a critical component of rehabilitation for patients with shoulder impingement syndromes. Traditional SA exercises have included scapular protraction exercises such as the push-up plus. These exercises promote activation of the SA near 90° of humeral elevation, but not in positions above 90° where patients typically experience pain. Methods and Measures: Twenty healthy subjects were studied performing 3 exercises: (1) wall slide, (2) plus phase of a wall push-up plus, and (3) scapular plane shoulder elevation. Three-dimensional position of the thorax, scapula, and humerus and muscle activity from the SA, upper and lower trapezius, and latissimus dorsi were recorded. The magnitudes of activation for each muscle at 90°, 120°, and 140° of humeral elevation were quantified from EMG records. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to determine the degree to which the different exercises activated the SA at the 3 humeral positions. Results: The intensity of SA activity was not significantly different between the 3 exercises at 90° of humeral elevation (P = .40). For the wall slide and scapular plane shoulder elevation exercises, SA activity increased with increasing humeral elevation angle (P = .001), with no significant differences between the 2 exercises (P = .36). Conclusion: The wall slide is an effective exercise to activate the SA muscle at and above 90° of shoulder elevation. During this exercise, SA activation is not significantly different from SA activation during the push-up plus and scapular plane shoulder elevation, 2 exercises previously validated in the literature.

N2  - Shoulder-related dysfunction affects individuals' ability to function independently and thus decreases quality of life. Functional task assessment is a key concern for a clinician in diagnostic assessment, outcome measurement, and planning of treatment programs. The purpose of this study was to test the reliability of the FASTRAK 3-dimensional (3-D) motion analysis and surface electromyography (sEMG) systems to analyze 3-D shoulder complex movements during functional tasks and compare motion patterns between subjects with and without shoulder dysfunctions (SDs).For the test, sEMG and 3-D motion analysis systems were used to characterize the functional tasks. Twenty-five asymptomatic male subjects and 21 male subjects with right shoulder disorders performed four functional tasks which involved arm reaching and raising activities with their dominant arms. Reliability was estimated by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Motion pattern was compared between two groups using mixed analysis of variances (ANOVAs). Shoulder complex kinematics and associated muscular activities during functional tasks were reliably quantified (ICC = 0.83-0.99) from the means of three trials. Relative to the group without SDs, the group with SDs showed significant alteration in shoulder complex kinematics (3°-40°) and associated muscular activities (3-10% maximum). Scapular tipping, scapular elevation, upper trapezius muscle function, and serratus anterior muscle function may have implications in the rehabilitation of patients with SDs. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The aim was to determine the relative contribution of the glenohumeral ligaments/joint capsule complex and the limited joint volume/adhesion-cohesion (UV/AC) mechanisms to the static stability of the canine glenohumeral joint (GHJ). The GHJ of 32 complete cadaver specimens were manipulated to determine the presence of gross laxity (> 2mm translation) at joint angles of 150 degrees, 135 degrees and 90 degrees. Following the removal of the peri-articular muscles, laxity was measured by applying a 15N force to the scapula in a variety of directions whilst the humerus was fixed to a jig. This was repeated for the abovementioned angles in intact joints and after venting and flushing to eliminate the UV/AC mechanisms. Results of clinical palpation and biomechanical studies were compared. Manipulation revealed a marked variation between joints although there was a tendency for progressive laxity as the joint was flexed. This finding was supported by the biomechanical study that also demonstrated no significant difference between intact and vented joints except in a cranio-caudal direction at 135 degrees and 90 degrees, and in a medial/lateral direction at 135 degrees. Static stabilisers permitted a wide range of motion. Individual clinical palpations did not correlate well with biomechanical findings. Manipulation was difficult to perform and is unlikely to be a reliable method for determining subtle joint laxity. The static stabilisers do not appear to play a significant role in providing joint constraint during normal range of motion (except extension). Diagnoses of pathological laxity attributable to the static stabilisers should be made with caution and surgical treatments should take cognizance of the above-mentioned biomechanical features.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Failure of fusion of the secondary centers of ossification of the acromial apophyses is a pathology that should be included in the differential diagnosis of shoulder pain and subacromial impingement syndrome. Mobility of the meso-acromion is of particular importance in choosing the appropriate treatment. This study presents a new arthroscopic method to evaluate the mobility of os acromiale. METHODS: We presented the arthroscopic evaluation and surgical treatment of three women (mean age 43.3 years; range 34 to 53 years) with shoulder pain and a radiographically confirmed meso-acromiale. The Neer and Hawkins impingement signs were positive and palpation over the acromion gave rise to pain. Axillary radiographs showed a meso-acromion in all the affected shoulders. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a rotator cuff tear in one patient. During arthroscopic examination the motility of the meso-acromion was dynamically observed in the subacromial region and the rotator cuff tear was repaired. Acromioplasty was not performed. Following removal of pseudarthrotic areas, the mobile meso-acromion was fixed with a cerclage wire, two cannulated screws and bone grafting, followed by a tension-band configuration. The mean follow-up was five years (range 3 to 6 years). RESULTS: Union occurred in all the patients. None of the patients had shoulder pain at rest or during activities. When compared with the normal side, the range of motion and the strength of the shoulder were normal in all the patients, with Constant scores being 89, 96, and 98, respectively. CONCLUSION: Identification of the type of os acromiale is important for the treatment plan. The meso-acromion is particularly important because of its greater size and its role in narrowing the subacromial space. It is necessary to determine whether the meso-acromion fragment is mobile. Dynamic arthroscopic examination offers significant help in this respect.

N2  - The aim of this study was to analyze the outcome of extraarticular glenoid neck fractures with respect to glenoid neck malunion and rotator cuff injury. These fractures are often considered to have a favorable outcome if treated conservatively. More recent studies reveal that the outcome is not uniformly good, but the cause of poor outcomes has not been investigated. Our study identified 9 patients who had sustained a glenoid neck fracture of the scapula within the last 10 years and who were treated conservatively with immobilization and then early active motion. Their functional and anatomic outcomes were analyzed by clinical examination and validated scoring systems, including the Oxford questionnaire and Constant score. Plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging were correlated to outcome. None of the 9 patients were pain-free, and some had poor Oxford and Constant scores. Pain was associated with glenoid neck malunion and evidence of subacromial bursitis or rotator cuff tendinopathy (or both).

N2  - The treatment of a worn-out, fractured or nonfunctional shoulder by means of a total shoulder prosthesis is becoming increasingly popular. Consequently, the indications and execution of shoulder arthroplasty need to be better defined. The shoulder joint can be treated by either an anatomical reconstruction or a reversed shoulder prosthesis (the sphere-ball is put into the place of the cup-socket and vice-versa). The decision is based on whether a functional rotator cuff can be preserved or recreated. With a rotator cuff that guarantees a good active centering of the humeral sphere in the glenoid socket an anatomical prosthesis is preferred, if it can - certainly at the glenoid side - be placed accurately to within a millimeter and degree. If the rotator cuff function is permanently lost, good and painfree shoulder function can be achieved with the reversed shoulder prosthesis, mainly because medialization of the rotation center of the shoulder can double the force of the remaining deltoid muscle. A further study of the clinical results and the computer-simulated results will allow us in the near future to treat more and more patients with better functional results.

N2  - Background: It is important to deal with the scapula when developing rehabilitation strategies for the shoulder complex. This requires clinical measurement tools that are readily available and easy to apply and which provide a reliable evaluation of scapula motion. Aim: To determine the reliability of the Plurimeter-V gravity inclinometer for the measurement of scapular upward rotation positions during humeral elevation in coronal abduction in a group of patients with shoulder pathology. Method: Twenty six patients were assessed in two repeat tests within a single testing session. Patients exhibiting a wide spectrum of shoulder pathology were selected. The angle of scapular upward rotation was measured during total shoulder abduction. The measurement protocol was performed twice during a single testing session by a single tester. Results of the two tests were compared and the reliability assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results: There was no significant difference in the scapula measurements taken during the two tests at each testing position. Overall, there was very good intrarater reliability (ICC = 0.88). The ICC ranged from 0.81 (at 135°) to 0.94 (at both resting and end of total shoulder abduction range). Conclusion: The Plurimeter-V gravity inclinometer can be used effectively and reliably for measuring upward rotation of the scapula in all ranges of shoulder abduction in the coronal plane.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to determine if, within a normal population: (1) palpation of the humeral head, relative to the acromion, in three static positions, was a reliable technique (2) there was a difference in humeral head position between the dominant and non-dominant shoulders in the three positions (3) there was a difference in humeral head position relative to the acromion between the arm at side (AS), the 90° abduction/external rotation (AER) and 90° abduction/internal rotation (AIR) positions. This test-retest study recorded palpation landmarks using a standardized protocol. Intra-tester reliability was above 0.8 for both AS and AER and all other ICCs were below 0.6. There was no systematic difference between dominant and non-dominant sides in any of the three positions (AS P=0.408, AER P=0.448, AIR P=0.233). There was a significant difference in measurements between each position (P<0.001). It can be concluded that, palpation of humeral head position in relation to the acromion is a reliable technique in the AS position. These normative data provide a baseline that can be used for future comparison if differences are found to exist in subgroups with pathological shoulder conditions where larger glenohumeral translations are thought to exist. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The goal of this study was to adapt roentgen photogrammetry to in vivo studies of shoulder skeletal motion during arm elevation in the scapular plane. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have been published describing shoulder bone movements. They involve plain radiographic measurements and utilize a three-dimensional (3D) approach. Measurements are either direct using pins implanted in bones, or indirect recording points on medical images. Roentgen photogrammetry locates points in space from two projections obtained from two different radiographic incidences. The technique has been applied in vivo by implanting metallic balls in bones. However, to be used as a standard clinical procedure, the technique must be adapted to be less invasive. In vivo photogrammetric reconstruction of known points in 3D space requires that the subject is strictly motionless between the successive radiographic exposures or that the exposures are obtained simultaneously. Methods used in this study were developed to allow subsequent exposures to be used for analysis. Numerical tools have been developed to align the two projections of a point in 3D space which have moved slightly between two successive exposures. The standard photogrammetric technique is completed by geometric modeling of the shoulder complex and humerus, and by the control of their mutual proximity at the level of joints. Bones are modeled as a set of simple volumes linked together using geometric shapes described by shape parameters. The coincidence between real bone contours and radiographic projections of the modeled bone gives the values of the shape parameters and the accurate location in space. Results focus on two different topics: errors related to the use of roentgen photogrammetry with successive exposures, and results obtained by applying roentgen photogrammetry to the in vivo shoulder complex. Results describing shoulder bone and joint displacements are presented for comparison with previously published results. The technique of roentgen photogrammetry can successfully be applied to patients. The radiographic protocol is simple, and data can be obtained easily and quickly from the digitized films. The data obtained from asymptomatic shoulders compared favorably with published values. Future research will focus on comparisons between kinematics of the symptomatic and asymptomatic contralateral limbs in volunteers. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

N2  - Measurement of scapular kinematics is an important component in the assessment of shoulder function; however, repeatability of these measurements has not been established. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine the repeatability of scapular rotation measures for different humeral elevation planes between trials, sessions, and days. Three-dimensional scapular rotations were collected using an electromagnetic tracking system in three planes of humeral elevation. Coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC) values were calculated between trials, sessions, and days for curves of scapular rotations. CMC values were compared with repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVAs) and Tukey's post-hoc procedures. Tests of simple main effects were performed for significant interaction effects. Our results suggest that scapular rotation measures are repeatable between trials within the same testing session, but less repeatable between testing sessions and days. Sagittal plane elevation consistently yielded the highest CMC values for all scapular rotations. These results suggest sagittal plane elevation should be considered to evaluate differences in scapular rotations. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Inc.

N2  - Background. The complex skeletal deformations that accompany Idioapthic Scoliosis pose a challenge to the clinician to non-invasively discriminate Idiopathic Scoliosis patients from children with no pathology. Therefore, the focus of this study is to non-invasively evaluate the position and amplitude of displacement of the pelvis, shoulders and thorax during quiet standing of Idiopathic Scoliosis patients and control subjects. Methods. The quiet standing posture of 18 healthy adolescent females and 22 Idiopathic Scoliosis subjects was evaluated using an Optotrak 3020 position sensor over a period of 120 s, with 4 repeat trials. Outcome measures included the mean position, root mean square amplitude and range over the duration of 120 s trials for both linear and angular measures of the pelvis, thorax and shoulders. Appropriate sample times were chosen and evaluated for stability over the 120 s period, and between trial reliability was evaluated. Findings. There was a significant difference between groups for the mean position of the shoulder blade rotation in reference to the base of support and to the pelvis. The Idiopathic Scoliosis patients had a significantly larger root mean square amplitude of anterior-posterior displacement of the T1 and S1 spinous processes in reference to the base of support. There was no difference between the sample durations to estimate the mean position of the body segments, however the root mean square increased significantly. Interpretation. This study demonstrates that postural abnormalities are evident during quiet standing in Idiopathic Scoliosis patients. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - An automatic three-dimensional non-rigid registration scheme is proposed in this paper and applied to thoracic computed tomography (CT) data of patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). According to the registration scheme, initially anatomical set of points such as the vertebral spine, the ribs, and shoulder blades are automatically segmented slice by slice from the two CT scans of the same patient in order to serve as interpolant points. Based on these extracted features, a rigid-body transformation is then applied to provide a pre-registration of the data. To establish correspondence between the feature points, the novel application of the self-organizing maps (SOMs) is adopted. In particular, the automatic correspondence of the interpolant points is based on the initialization of the Kohonen neural network model capable to identify 500 corresponding pairs of points approximately in the two CT sets. Then, radial basis functions (RBFs) using the shifted log function is subsequently employed for elastic warping of the image volume, using the correspondence between the interpolant points, as obtained in the previous phase. Quantitative and qualitative results are also presented to validate the performance of the proposed elastic registration scheme resulting in an alignment error of 6 mm, on average, over 15 CT paired datasets. Finally, changes of the tumor volume in respect to each reference dataset are estimated for all patients, which indicate inspiration and/or movement of the patient during acquisition of the data. Thus, the practical implementation of this scheme could provide estimations of lung tumor volumes during radiotherapy treatment planning. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Os acromiale is a developmental aberration in which the distal acromion fails to fuse. This aberration is often discovered incidentally but may present with a clinical picture similar to that of subacromial impingement syndrome. Treatment for symptomatic os acromiale is initially nonoperative-activity modification, physical therapy, corticosteroid injection, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication. Nonoperative management of clinically significant, radiographically confirmed os acromiale should be pursued for at least 6 months before consideration of surgical intervention. Subacromial decompression is often necessary to address symptoms of impingement. Excision of the os fragment may provide definitive treatment for smaller fragments (<3 cm). Removal of larger fragments remains controversial and should be approached with caution. Surgical fixation of larger fragments with or without supplemental autograft in conjunction with a structured postoperative program of physical therapy can reliably provide relief for symptomatic os acromiale.

N2  - The high prevalence of shoulder-related dysfunction has focused increased attention on functional activity assessment. This study (1) tested the reliability of three-dimensional shoulder complex movements during four functional tasks representing different levels of task difficulty, (2) characterized the four functional tasks, and (3) examined the relationships between age and shoulder movements. Twenty-five asymptomatic subjects, all veterans aged 30-82, performed the four functional tasks. Good within-session reliability was found (movement pattern: similarity index = 0.81 to 0.97, peak values: intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.88 to 0.99). The raising arm to overhead height task (hard task) placed the greatest demand on scapular motions and humeral elevation (p < 0.005). During the functional tasks, significant correlations existed between age and scapular tipping, humeral elevation, and scapular upward rotation (r = -0.62 to 0.50, p < 0.05). Correlation results indicated that elderly subjects have a greater potential for serratus anterior muscle weakness and shoulder capsule tightness.

N2  - A study was designed to evaluate the joint laxity during scoliosis screening, and to show if there is a relation of joint laxity values to the trunk rotation. One thousand, two hundred and seventy-three children (598 females, 675 males) with an average age of 10.4 years were screened with a scoliometer and forward bending for trunk rotations. Scapular and shoulder elevations, flexible pes planus were recorded and joint laxity was evaluated with the Beighton score. There was high inter-observer and intra-observer reliability for both scoliometer and Beighton scores. In 41 children (3.2%) with Beighton score 7 or higher, trunk rotation measurements were higher than for the rest of the children. Trunk rotation measurements of 7° or higher were found in 30 children, who were more lax than the rest of the group and were invited for radiography, with a detection of curves between 11 and 18° in 10 of them. The Beighton score is a practical and reliable method for defining joint laxity. Although the number of patients with scoliosis was limited, there are findings supporting the relation between joint laxity and scoliosis. Moreover, there was increased laxity in children with increased trunk rotations. Ligamentous laxity may be one of the causes changing the contour of the back. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Background: Measuring isokinetic strength of the shoulder complex is potentially an important clinical tool in both diagnosis and management of injury and pathology. However, a clinically relevant position is yet to be established. Objectives: To establish an appropriate and repeatable protocol to evaluate the functional strength of both internal and external rotators of the glenohumeral joint to enable assessment of clinical injury management and training related developments in upper limb strength. Methods: A population cross-sectional study of shoulder internal and external rotational strengths of 17 normal, healthy volunteers (11 males, 6 females) aged 21 to 45 years were measured both isokinetically and isometrically. Two test positions: seated and supine, were compared by way of reliability and repeatability analyses. Humeral rotation was performed at 45° of abduction in the scapular plane seated, and at 90° of abduction in the supine position. Results: Throughout concentric testing, when the population was considered as a whole the left shoulder data appeared more repeatable than the right shoulder. This however, was not evident when the study population was divided into single sex groupings. Equally, whilst the repeatability trend of sitting vs. supine position was skewed towards the former, more evident in the left shoulder, this was less apparent when sexes were analysed separately. All comparative measures were statistically insignificant. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that measurements of isokinetic shoulder rotation strength are highly prone to both joint specific and non-specific errors. © 2005 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Rotator cuff problems are among the most commonly encountered disorders of the shoulder, and are commonly seen by primary care physicians. Their exact mechanism for susceptibility to injury remains unclear; however, with an understanding of the shoulder's anatomy and biomechanics, we are better able to treat the insults incurred on the cuff. Early recognition, proper treatment, and appropriate follow-up may expedite healing and prevent the occurrence of further injury or complications.

N2  - Background: Rotator cuff lesions are common in the community but reproducibility of tests for shoulder assessment has not been adequately appraised and there is no uniform approach to their use. Objective: To study interrater reproducibility of standard tests for shoulder evaluation among a rheumatology specialist, rheumatology trainee, and research nurse. Methods: 136 patients were reviewed over 12 months at a major teaching hospital. The three assessors examined each patient in random order and were unaware of each other's evaluation. Each shoulder was examined in a standard manner by recognised tests for specific lesions and a diagnostic algorithm was used. Between-observer agreement was determined by calculating Cohen's κ coefficients (measuring agreement beyond that expected by chance). Results: Fair to substantial agreement was obtained for the observations of tenderness, painful arc, and external rotation. Tests for supraspinatus and subscapularis also showed at least fair agreement between observers. 40/55 (73%) κ coefficient assessments were rated at >0.2, indicating at least fair concordance between observers; 21/55 (38%) were rated at >0.4, indicating at least moderate concordance between observers. Conclusion: The reproducibility of certain tests, employed by observers of varying experience, in the assessment of the rotator cuff and general shoulder disease was determined. This has implications for delegation of shoulder assessment to nurse specialists, the development of a simplified evaluation schedule for general practitioners, and uniformity in epidemiological research studies.

N2  - Objectives. To determine whether the Kibler method of scapular position measurement has adequate inter-tester reliability in a muscular population, such as healthy swimmers, in sport-specific positions, and when using side-to-side measures. Design. Same day repeated measures inter-tester reliability study. Setting. Two Western Australian aquatic centers. Participants. Fifteen junior elite swimmers were measured by three investigators. Main outcome measures. The distances between the medial spine of the scapula and T3/4 (Superior Kibler) and the inferior scapula angle and T7/8 (Inferior Kibler) were recorded. Subjects were tested with arms in neutral, hands on hips, abduction, and full elevation. Results. Superior and Inferior Kibler measures had similar reliability, with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) 0.20-0.82 and standard error of measurements (SEMs) 5.3-11.9 mm. Reliability decreased with glenohumeral elevation for Superior Kibler but not for Inferior Kibler. Side-to-side measures were less reliable with ICCs 0.26-0.64 and SEMs 5.8-14.4 mm. Conclusions. Measurement of scapular position in an athletic population appears to be as reliable as in non-athletic populations (SEMs of 4.5-16.5 mm). This level of reliability is barely adequate to confidently detect clinically important differences of 10-15 mm. A sport-specific position such as full flexion may highlight subtle impairments, but has decreased reliability for the Superior Kibler. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Stress analysis in the individual parts of the scapula under normal physiological conditions is necessary to understand the load transfer mechanism, its relation with morphology of bone and to analyse the deviations in stress patterns due to implantation of the glenoid. The purpose of this study was to obtain stress distribution in the scapula during abduction of the arm and to obtain a qualitative estimate of the function of coracoacromial ligament. An accurate three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) model of the natural scapula has been developed for this purpose, using computed tomography data and shell-solid modelling approach. The model was experimentally validated. A musculoskeletal shoulder model of forces that calculates all muscle, ligament and joint reaction forces, in six load cases (30-180°) during unloaded humeral abduction was used as applied loading conditions for the 3D FE model. High tensile and compressive stresses (15-60MPa) were generated in the thick bony ridges of the scapula, like the scapular spine, lateral border, glenoid and acromion. High compressive stresses (45-58MPa) were evoked in the glenoid and at the connection of glenoid-scapular spine-infraspinous fossa. The stresses in the infraspinous fossa and supraspinous fossa were low (0.05-15MPa). These results indicated that the transfer of major muscle and joint reaction take place predominantly through the thick bony ridges, whereas the fossa area act more as attachment sites of large muscles. During humeral abduction, coracoacromial ligament was stretched, and presumably will be under tension. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether a relationship existed between primary adhesive capsulitis and acromial morphology. Case control series. Between January 1999 and June 2002, a total of 100 patients (104 shoulders) were diagnosed with adhesive capsulitis. A retrospective chart review was performed of all of these patients. A total of 67 patients (69 shoulders) met the inclusion criteria of primary adhesive capsulitis. The patients range of motion and signs of impingement were documented. The supraspinatus outlet radiographs were assessed, and each patients acromial morphology was graded as type I, II, or III. A case control group of 53 patients (58 shoulders) was assessed to determine the validity of our results. This group consisted of a series of new patients that were referred to the clinic during February 2003 for assessment of their shoulders. The average age of the patients in the adhesive capsulitis group was 52.5 7.6 years, with 34 women (50.7%) and 33 men (49.3%). The control group had an average age of 51.1 16.9 years in a series of 19 (35.8%) women and 34 (64.2%) men. The average range of motion was 98.0 23.5 of forward elevation, and 91.9 24.3 of abduction. The forward elevation was 165.5 15.3 and the abduction was 162.4 18.4. The predominant acromial morphology in both groups in this study was a type II acromion (75.4% in the adhesive capsulitis group and 74.1% in the control group). The -square analysis within the specific groups showed statistically significant differences in the number of type II compared with type I acromions, and type II compared with type III acromions in both series. However, statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the various acromial types when comparing the adhesive capsulitis group with the control group. Our results show a significant number of patients with both adhesive capsulitis and, in the control group, type II acromions. We found no statistical difference between these 2 groups. Based on our results, the intrinsic trauma that occurs from subacromial space narrowing caused by the anterior acromial shape, cannot be implicated as the cause of primary adhesive capsulitis.

N2  - Proper function of serratus anterior plays a vital role in the movement and stability of the scapula, and thus of the glenohumeral joint and the upper limb. The unique anatomy of this muscle makes direct measurements of its fatigue properties impossible. Here we describe for the first time indirect measurements of the myoelectric manifestations of fatigue in the serratus anterior. Eight healthy volunteers (29-35 years) were tested, four of them on two different occasions, using two exercise protocols (60 s isometric maximum upward force in 120° arm flexion, and 60 s maximum forward force at 90° arm flexion) with simultaneous recording by surface and wire electrodes applied according to established methods. Signals were analysed to obtain the rate of fall of median EMG frequency and the rate of rise of amplitude. Both exercise protocols gave similar results. Frequency-slope measurements (mean rate of fall 0.6 ± 0.1% initial value per second (% s-1) with both surface and wire electrodes) were more precise than those of amplitude (mean rate of rise 2.6 ± 0.3% s-1 with surface electrodes, only 1.3 ± 0.2% s-1 with wire electrodes). Surface electrodes gave much lower variation than fine wires, the coefficient of variation of slopes for surface electrodes being approximately 20-40% both between studies in a single subject and between subjects. In 5 patients (aged 22-59 years) recovering from long thoracic nerve palsy studied using surface electrodes the frequency slopes was normal (0.6 ± 0.1% s-1), while the amplitude slope was reduced 0.9 ± 0.4% s-1, P=0.01). This shows abnormal fatigue properties of the reinnervated muscle and a dissociation between the frequency and amplitude manifestations of fatigue. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of Orthopaedic Research Society.

N2  - At the end ranges of motion, the glenohumeral capsule limits translation of the humeral head in multiple directions. Since the 6-degree of freedom kinematics of clinical tests are commonly utilized to diagnose shoulder injuries, the objective of this study was to determine the magnitude and repeatability of glenohumeral joint kinematics during a simulated simple anteroposterior translation test in the anterior and posterior directions. A magnetic tracking system was used to determine the kinematics of the humerus with respect to the scapula in eight cadaveric shoulders. At 60° of glenohumeral abduction and 0° of flexion/extension, a clinician applied anterior and posterior loads to the humerus at 0°, 30°, and 60° of external rotation until a manual maximum (simulating a simple translation test) was achieved. Prior to each test, the reference position of the humerus shifted posteriorly 1.8 ± 2.0 and 4.1 ± 3.8 mm at 30° and 60° of external rotation, respectively. Anterior translation decreased significantly (p<0.05) from 18.2 ± 5.3 mm at 0° of external rotation to 15.5 ± 5.1 and 9.9 ± 5.5 mm at 30° and 60°, respectively. However, no significant differences were detected between the posterior translations of 13.4 ± 6.4, 17.1 ± 5.0, and 15.8 ± 6.0 mm at 0°, 30°, and 60° of external rotation, respectively. Coupled translations (perpendicular to the direction of loading) at 0° (6.1 ± 4.0 and 3.8 ± 2.9 mm), 30° (4.7 ± 2.7 and 5.9 ± 3.1 mm), and 60° (2.3 ± 2.3 and 5.0 ± 3.5 mm) of external rotation were in the inferior direction in both the anterior and posterior directions, respectively. Based on the data obtained, performing a simulated simple translation test should result in coupled inferior translations and anterior translations that are a function of external rotation. The low standard deviations demonstrate that the observed translations should be repeatable. Furthermore, capsular stretching or injury to the anterior-inferior region of the capsule should be detectable during clinical examination if excessive coupled translations exist or no posterior shift of the reference position with external rotation is noted. © 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society.

N2  - The spinal accessory nerve, or cranial nerve XI, is the sole innervation of the trapezius muscle, which plays an integral role in stabilizing the scapula. Comprised of 3 functional components, the trapezius assists in coordination of scapulothoracic rhythm by retracting, elevating, and rotating the scapula. Secondary to its superficial course in the posterior triangle of the neck, the spinal accessory nerve is susceptible to iatrogenic, traumatic, and traction injuries. Spinal accessory nerve palsy may lead to pain, weakness, and altered mechanics of the entire shoulder girdle. Drooping of the shoulder is a result of lateral translation and downward rotation of the scapula. Presenting signs include an asymmetric neckline, lateral winging of the scapula, pain and weakness of shoulder abduction, and forward elevation. Essential to making the diagnosis is a complete clinical, radiographic, and electrodiagnostic examination. When the palsy is identified early, within 6 months of injury, microsurgical repair or reconstruction of the nerve may be considered. Favorable results are seen when the nerve is addressed within 6 months of the injury; while outcomes deteriorate when explored over a year from injury. A 12 month period of nonoperative management is recommended. Patients who have failed conservative treatment or nerve repair may be considered surgical candidates for scapula stabilization. The current treatment of choice for such patients is the modified Eden-Lange procedure, which transfers the insertions of the levator scapulae, rhomboideus minor, and rhomboideus major laterally. The modified Eden-Lange reliably relieves pain, improves function, and diminishes deformity for patients with a spinal accessory nerve palsy.

N2  - MR imaging is an exquisite tool for delineating normal structures and abnormalities of the rotator cuff and for determining the location and extent of rotator cuff tears before surgery. Although standard MR imaging can accurately demonstrate full-thickness rotator cuff tears and some partial-thickness tears, MR arthrography can increase diagnostic accuracy in small partial-thickness articular surface tears. MR imaging helps to distinguish between many other causes of shoulder pain that may mimic rotator cuff tears.

N2  - The accuracy of measuring angulation of stable proximal humerus fractures using the axillary lateral projection was investigated. A closing wedge osteotomy with apex anterior angulation was performed on two cadaveric humeri to simulate a stable surgical neck fracture. One specimen was fixed at 30° angulation and the other at 55°. Axillary radiographs were taken with each specimen articulating with the glenoid of a cadaveric scapula. The humerus was held in neutral rotation. Abduction was set at 30°, 60°, and 90°. In each position of abduction, an axillary lateral radiograph was taken in 30° forward flexion, neutral, and 30° extension to simulate various arm positions. A total of nine radiographs were taken for each specimen. The axillary view is not accurate for measurement of proximal humerus angulation at the arm positions commonly encountered in the trauma setting.

N2  - The ability of subjects with multidirectional shoulder instability to use proprioception to complete a series of upper limb repositioning tasks was investigated. Twelve subjects with multidirectional instability and 12 control subjects were blindfolded and instructed to use proprioception to reproduce a self-selected target position as accurately as possible. Subjects completed 10 repetitions for each limb using three distinct upper limb movements: overhead reaching, scapular plane pointing, and humeral external rotation with abduction. A three-dimensional video motion analysis system tracked limb position and determined spatial hand position error. Subjects with multidirectional shoulder instability showed significantly greater hand position error than control subjects. No hand position error differences were found between the symptomatic and the asymptomatic limbs of subjects in the instability group. Interrepetition error for subjects in both groups improved significantly during the first three movement cycles. These results suggest that after movement initiation, dynamic proprioception was a factor in improving hand position accuracy in both groups, but to a lesser degree in subjects with multidirectional instability. Consequently, subjects with multidirectional instability may have a reduced capacity to use proprioception to refine and control the motor output of the upper limb.

N2  - Study Design: Repeated-measures experiment. Objective: To compare measures of end point accuracy (EPA) for 2 feedback conditions: (1) visual and kinesthetic feedback and (2) kinesthetic feedback alone, during shoulder movements, at 3 different speeds. Background: Shoulder joint kinesthesia is typically reported with EPA measures, such as constant error. Reporting multiple measures of EPA, such as variable error and absolute error, could provide a more detailed description of performance. Methods and Measures: Subjects were seated with the shoulder abducted 90° in the scapular plane and externally rotated 75°, with the forearm placed in a custom shoulder wheel. Subjects internally rotated the shoulder 27° to a target position at 48° of shoulder external rotation for both conditions. Motion analysis was used to determine peak angular velocity and 3 EPA measures for shoulder movements. Each EPA measure was compared between the 2 feedback conditions and among the 3 speeds with a separate 2-way analysis of variance. Results: Movements performed with kinesthetic feedback alone, measured by constant error (P<.01), variable error (P<.01), and absolute error (P<.01), were less accurate than movements performed with visual and kinesthetic feedback. Faster movements were less accurate when measured by constant error (P = .01) and absolute error (P<.01) than slower movements. Subjects tended to overshoot the target in the absence of visual feedback; however, movement speed played minimal role in the overshooting. Conclusions: Multiple measures of EPA, such as constant, variable, and absolute error during simple restricted shoulder movements may provide additional information regarding the evaluation of a motor performance or identify different central nervous system control mechanisms for joint kinesthesia.

N2  - Injuries at the shoulder joint caused by specific movements during sports practice are rising. Due to a better diagnosis (e. g. arthroscopy) a lot of these injuries could be detected more accurately. Rehabilitation in sports injuries has to be based on an intensive knowledge of the accompanying anatomy, details of the injury itself and knowledge on rehabilitation which should take place in specificly defined stages. Only with this approach sufficient rehabilitation will be possible.

N2  - Suprascapular nerve blockade improves pain, range of motion, and disability in acute and chronic shoulder pain. Pain relief usually lasts several hours with local anesthetic. If steroids are added, the relief lasts several weeks. Since repetitive steroid exposure is associated with several hazards , alternative long-term therapies would be desirable. Pulsed mode radiofrequency is a non-destructive, safe, and repeatable long-term pain control therapy. We report a case, wherein a series of fluoroscopically guided, suprascapular nerve pulsed mode RF treatments were performed. Each provided 4-5 months of pain relief and improvement in shoulder function, without deterioration in muscle strength.

N2  - OBJECTIVE. Our objective was to evaluate the predictive value of various MRI findings in the acromioclavicular joint for pain relief after intraarticular injection. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The acromioclavicular joint of 50 patients (20 women, 30 men; mean age, 51 years; range, 25-75 years) was evaluated on MRIs of the shoulder. Osteophytes, subchondral cysts and irregularities, bone marrow edema, joint effusion, and joint capsule hypertrophy were assessed by two musculoskeletal radiologists in consensus. Local anesthetics were injected into the acromioclavicular joint with fluoroscopic guidance. Patients graded pain relief on a visual analogue scale (0-100%) after 15 min. The relationship between pain relief and MRI findings was assessed with the Mann-Whitney U test. Pain relief equal to or greater than 70% was rated as a positive response to the injection. This cutoff value was used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive values of the various MRI findings in determining which acromioclavicular joints were responsive to joint injections. RESULTS. Mean pain relief after injection was 38%. Pain relief was significantly related to capsular hypertrophy (p = 0.007) and was equal to or greater than 70% in 11 patients. The sensitivity in diagnosing a successful injection (range, 9-82%) was highest for caudal osteophytes (82%) and capsular hypertrophy (73%). The specificity (range, 51-97%) was highest for subchondral cysts (97%), subchondral bone marrow edema (95%), and joint effusion (92%). CONCLUSION. Pain relief after intraarticular injection is significantly related to capsular hypertrophy diagnosed on MRI. MRI findings have a reasonable sensitivity and a high specificity in predicting relevant short-term pain relief after intraarticular injection.

N2  - Scapular assessment is a critical component of a complete shoulder evaluation. In the last 10 years the ability to measure normal scapular kinematics during glenohumeral elevation has dramatically improved our understanding of normal scapular motion. Scapular-clinical-assessment techniques have been developed that need further consideration in their ability to discriminate abnormal from normal variation. Scapular-assessment findings need to follow a standard biomechanical terminology to improve communication among clinicians.

N2  - The trapezius is one of the major scapular-stabilizing muscles. It is composed of 3 functional components and contributes to coordinated scapulothoracic rhythm by elevating, rotating, and retracting the scapula. The muscle is primarily innervated by the spinal accessory nerve, or cranial nerve XI. The superficial course of the spinal accessory nerve in the posterior cervical triangle makes it susceptible to iatrogenic or penetrating trauma. Idiopathic and traction injuries are also seen. Paralysis and/or dysfunction of the trapezius may result in pain, stiffness, weakness, and altered mechanics of the shoulder girdle. The scapula translates laterally and rotates downward, resulting in pronounced drooping of the shoulder. Patients typically present with an asymmetric neckline, winging of the scapula, and weakness of forward elevation and abduction. A complete clinical, radiographic, and electrodiagnostic evaluation is critical to making an accurate diagnosis. When trapezius dysfunction is recognized within 1 year of a penetrating injury or iatrogenic insult, microsurgical reconstruction of the nerve may be considered. Dysfunction discovered after this time is less likely to improve with direct nerve repair or neurolysis. Active and healthy patients who fail a reasonable trial (9-12 months) of nonoperative management are appropriate candidates for surgical reconstruction to stabilize the scapula. The modified Eden-Lange procedure, which laterally transfers the insertions of the levator scapulae, rhomboideus minor, and rhomboideus major muscles, is the current treatment of choice for such patients. This procedure reliably relieves pain, corrects deformity, and improves function in patients ith irreparable injury to the spinal accessory nerve.

N2  - Study Design: A prospective, criterion-based specificity study. Objective: To determine the specificity of the lateral scapular slide test (LSST) in detecting shoulder dysfunction in the competitive athlete. Background: The LSST was introduced in an attempt to objectively measure scapular stabilizer strength at varying amounts of load. Measurements between the inferior angle of the scapula and the closest spinous process are recorded in 3 different test positions. The original study of the LSST established a difference between the involved and noninvolved sides of 1.5 cm or greater in any position as an indication of shoulder dysfunction. In addition, the original sample used to develop the LSST consisted of symptomatic athletes only, with no asymptomatic control group. The LSST was originally based on the assumption that normal shoulder girdle function is symmetrical. However, some research reports that scapular resting position is highly variable between sides. Methods and Measures: The LSST was administered to 38 female and 33 male collegiate athletes who participated in 1-arm-dominant sports. All subjects had no present or past history of scoliosis, or cervical, shoulder, or elbow dysfunction. Results: Fifty-two of the 71 subjects displayed a difference of at least 1.5 cm in 1 or more of the 3 positions. Specificity of the test was determined to be 26.8%. Conclusion: Scapular position was commonly asymmetrical in the asymptomatic subjects. These variances in scapular position suggest that asymmetry does not necessarily indicate a dysfunction. The results show that the LSST has low specificity and its use is not recommended for determining shoulder dysfunction in competitive athletes.

N2  - Purpose of the study: The purpose of this work was to propose an objective radiographic evaluation of the antero-inferior gleno-humeral ligament for comparison with the clinical assessment proposed by Gagey. Material and methods: A test radiogram was obtained from 32 healthy volunteers (15 men, 17 women, mean age, 29 years, age range 21-54 years) free of shoulder disease. The dynamic test image consisted in a strictly AP view of the shoulder in forced abduction in neutral rotation. The subjects were awake and in dorsal decubitus. Displacements of the scapulo-thoracic articulation were limited by a counter-force applied to the acromion, in accordance with the method described by Gagey. Bilateral images were obtained for comparison. Several angles were measured between the humeral shaft and the scapula to search for the most reliable and reproducible measurement. Results: Three series of angles were measured between the axis of the humeral shaft and the scapula. The mean angle between the axis of the humeral shaft and line drawn from the lower rim of the glenoid cavity to the lateral border of the scapular tubercle was 130.3° (range 110-148°) on the dominant side and 131.5° (108-148°) on the non-dominant side; giving 38° variability on the dominant side and 40° variation on the non-dominant side and a standard deviation of 10.4° on the dominant side and 11.5° on the non-dominant side. The mean difference in gleno-humeral abduction was 3.8° (range 0-14°) between the dominant and non-dominant side. Discussion: Among the different angles measured between the scapula and the humerus, the angle between the axis of the humeral shaft and the line drawn from the lower rim of the glenoid cavity to the lateral border of the scapular tubercle was the most reliable and reproducible. Inter-observer measurements were well correlated. We observed that the variability in the radiographic values of the scapulo-humeral angle was much greater than the clinical values described by Gagey who, finding very constant values during forced abduction, described "invariable" scapulo-humeral abduction of the shoulder. Our study demonstrates that scapulo-humeral abduction is not an invariable parameter. More interestingly, the difference in amplitude between the dominant and non-dominant sides showed very strong interindividual correlation. Interobserver variability was low and reproducibility was good. Conclusion: This dynamic radiographic test enables a precise quantified assessment of pure gleno-humeral abduction which depends on the antero-inferior gleno-humeral ligament. This test is reliable and reproducible. Variations in the length of the antero-inferior gleno-humeral ligament evaluated radiographically were greater than described clinically. We did not find any difference in pure gleno-humeral abduction greater than 14° between the dominant and non-dominant sides in healthy subjects.

N2  - Objective. To identify sonographically the site and entity of alterations in a high number of patients with shoulder pain. Methods. Two different experienced operators (both rheumatologists), who were blinded to the clinical data, performed sonographic examinations on 528 shoulders of 425 consecutive patients with painful shoulder and in both shoulders of 198 control subjects. They carried out ultrasound examinations separately using a 7.5 MHz linear transducer. Investigation included the long head of the biceps tendon, the supraspinatus tendon, infraspinatus tendon, subscapularis tendon, acromioclavicular joint, glenohumeral joint, subacromial-subdeltoid bursa, subscapularis bursa, and finally identification of calcifications. Before the ultrasonographic exam, a third experienced rheumatologist performed a physical examinations in all patients using specific tests of movement of evaluation of the long head of biceps tendon, the suprapinatus tendon, infraspinatus tendon, subscapularis tendon, and acromioclavicular joint. Results. Sonographic alterations were found in a total of 94.1% of patients. The structure most frequently involved was the supraspinatus tendon (64.6%). The long head of the biceps tendon (48.1%) and the acromioclavicular joint (51.5%) were also frequenlty involved. Different types of alterations in the various structures were detected. Significant differences were found with respect to controls. A high sensitivity and specificity of sonography was demonstrated compared to physical examination. Conclusion. Sonography evaluates accurately the single anatomic structures of the shoulder and identifies both the side and type of changes in patients with painful shoulder. The high sensitivity/specificity, non-invasiveness and low costs of this techique justify its routine utilisation in clinical rheumatological practice.

N2  - Quantitative measures derived from raw myoelectric signal (MES) data must be normalized to allow for comparisons both within and between subjects. The most common method of normalization involves dividing the root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the MES recorded during a given activity by the RMS of the MES elicited during a maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of that particular muscle. The objective of this study was to use surface-recorded MES amplitude to determine the combination of electrode site, test position, head posture, and smoothing window that elicits the highest and most reliable MES amplitudes during an MVIC of the upper trapezius (UT) muscle. Ten volunteers had surface electrodes positioned at five sites on the UT of their dominant side. Three trials of each of three MVIC test positions were performed both with the head in neutral and rotated 45° to the contralateral side. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used for statistical hypothesis testing. Coefficients of variation were used to quantify the between-factor variability introduced in each case. In addition, the data were re-analyzed using moving windows of 100 to 500 ms in length, and an ANOVA was used to determine the effect of window length on both the amplitude and variability of the estimates of maximum voluntary activation (MVE). Head position had no significant effect on RMS amplitude of the MVIC in any of the test positions. There was a significant electrode site by test position interaction effect. Bonferroni post-hoc analyses were performed on this interaction by fixing test position and testing electrode site, revealing that Sites 1 (2 cm lateral to the midpoint between C7 spinous process and the posterolateral border of the acromion) and 4 (2 cm posterior to Site 1) recorded significantly higher RMS values for all test positions, and were not significantly different from each other. Fixing electrode site, the test position analysis revealed that abduction of the humerus, and abduction with external rotation of the humerus produced significantly higher RMS values than shoulder elevation at both Sites 1 and 4, and that abduction produced a significantly higher RMS amplitude than abduction in external rotation at Site 1. The results confirmed that Sites 1 and 4 consistently produced the highest MES amplitudes for all movements. Pure abduction consistently elicited maximal RMS values; however there is concern regarding supraspinatus cross talk during this movement. Site 1 was found to produce the most reliable data. A moving window of 100 ms was found to generate MVE estimates that were significantly higher than windows ranging from 200 ms to 500 ms in length. There was no effect of window length on the reliability of the MVEs. Based on this study, it was concluded that abduction or abduction with the arms in lateral rotation should be used as normalization contraction positions for the upper trapezius muscle. During this movement, Site 1 data smoothed with a moving window of 100 ms produces the highest amplitude MVE data but window lengths greater than 200 ms produce more stable estimates in terms of being able to compare studies in which moving windows are used to compute RMS. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To determine the effect of trunk sitting posture on scapular kinematics during humeral elevation by using skin-mounted electromagnetic tracking sensors. Design: Repeated-measures design contrasting scapular kinematics in 2 different sitting postures. Setting: A biomechanics laboratory in Hong Kong with a real-time, 3-dimensional electromagnetic tracking device for measuring movements of the scapula. Participants: A sample of 16 healthy adults (12 women, 4 men; age, 21.6±3.92y) with full, pain-free shoulder range of motion and no history of shoulder pathology. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Movements of the scapula were measured while each subject performed humeral elevation in an upright seated position and a slouched seated position. Results: In both postures, posterior tip, lateral and upward rotation of the scapula, and lateral rotation of the humerus were observed during humeral elevation. When the slouched posture was adopted, there were significant decreases in the posterior tip and lateral rotation of the scapula, but there was no significant change in the magnitude of the upward rotation of the scapula. Conclusion: Increased thoracic kyphosis significantly alters the kinematics of the scapula during humeral elevation. © 2003 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

N2  - A variety of pathological conditions affect the acromioclavicular joint and the surrounding structures. For each of these, different procedures have been described with varying degrees of success. This article focuses on contemporary procedures. The acromioclavicular joint can be reapproximated using one of three stabilization techniques: (1) primary fixation across the acromioclavicular joint, (2) secondary stabilization of the joint by recreating the anatomic linkage between the distal clavicle and the coracoid process, or (3) dynamic stabilization of the joint by creating an inferiorly directed force on the distal clavicle. These methods are not mutually exclusive and may be combined in a single operative setting to produce a final construct with superior mechanical stability.

N2  - Purpose: In 47 consecutive patients who had a shoulder impingement syndrome treated by arthroscopic subacromial decompression, we compared the functional outcome with the amount of the acromion resection. Type of Study: Prospective study. Methods: The inclusion criteria for patient selection was a chronic impingement syndrome unresolved by conservative treatment with an intact rotator cuff or with an irreparable rupture of the rotator cuff. The assessment was performed with the scoring system of Constant preoperatively and postoperatively. Quantitative measurements of the acromion resection were made by comparing preoperative and postoperative anteroposterior radiographic views, standardized under fluoroscopic control in order to become reproducible and comparable. There were 39 patients (41 shoulders) available for follow-up at 37 months. Results: The condition of the shoulder, concerning pain, motion and activities, was improved at the time of follow-up, the mean gain of the total functional score was 29 points/100. Age, side, activity, duration of pain before procedure and cuff statement had no influence on preoperative and postoperative Constant's score. The difference between preoperative and postoperative measurements of anterior acromion protuberance was significant. There was no correlation between the amount of the acromion resection and the improvement of Constant's score (P = .84). Conclusions: The origin of impingement syndrome is multi-factorial, and efficiency of arthroscopic decompression may not be only due to the amount of acromion resection. From these results and a literature review, this study analyzes several morphologic factors, which could explain the good results of arthroscopic subacromial decompression in impingement syndrome.

N2  - Objective: To assess scapular-positioning patterns using a static measurement technique. Design and Setting: We used a 4-within-factor design to compare scapular upward rotation among subjects. The within factors included side (dominant, nondominant), plane of motion (scapular, sagittal), direction of motion (ascending, descending), and level of humeral rotation (rest, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°). Subjects: Twenty-seven subjects with unimpaired shoulders. Measurements: We measured scapular position and glenohumeral range of motion using a digital inclinometer and goniometer, respectively. All measurements were performed bilaterally. Results: Between-session repeatability was poor to excellent depending on humeral-elevation angle. The scapular plane demonstrated significantly more scapular upward rotation than did the sagittal plane at 120° of humeral elevation. Conclusions: The scapula demonstrated a consistent pattern of downward rotation initially from rest to 30° of humeral elevation, followed by an upward rotation after 30° of humeral elevation to the highest level (120°). Scapular upward rotation is greater in the scapular plane than in the sagittal plane. Therefore, overhead rehabilitation exercises should be performed in the scapular plane, especially in subjects with rotator cuff tendinopathy.

N2  - New trends of numerical models of human joints require more and more computation of both large amplitude joint motions and fine bone stress distribution. Together, these problems are difficult to solve and very CPU time consuming. The goal of this study is to develop a new method to diminish the calculation time for this kind of problems which include calculation of large amplitude motions and infinitesimal strains. Based on the Principle of Virtual Power, the present method decouples the problem into two parts. First, rigid body motion is calculated. The bone micro-deformations are then calculated in a second part by using the results of rigid body motions as boundary conditions. A finite element model of the shoulder was used to test this decoupling technique. The model was designed to determine the influence of humeral head shape on stress distribution in the scapula for different physiological motions of the joint. Two versions of the model were developed: a first version completely deformable and a second version based on the developed decoupling method. It was shown that biomechanical variables, as mean pressure and von Mises stress, calculated with the two versions were sensibly the same. On the other hand, CPU time needed for calculating with the new decoupled technique was more than 6 times less than with the completely deformable model.

N2  - Shoulder-related symptoms are very common in rheumatic diseases. For the evaluation of the diagnosis as well as for therapy and prognosis, an anatomic assignment is essential. Clinical investigations alone are often not capable to do this. Ultrasonography is a method to delineate bony surfaces as well as the soft tissues around the shoulder joints statically and even dynamically. For the purpose of rheumatic diseases, ultrasound standard scans help to detect the lesions at the biceps tendon, the bursae, the rotator cuff, the humeral head as well as in the acromial and sternoclavicular joints. Considering the limitations of the method (obesity, frozen shoulder, no findings under bony structures) and knowing the pitfalls and errors of the method, ultrasonography is a reliable, quick and low cost method for the diagnosis of rheumatic shoulder joint pathology. Compared to computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography should be used as a screening method. The following standard scans are suggested for sonographic evaluation of the shoulder: 1) anterior transverse scan and 2) anterior longitudinal scan at the bicipal groove to detect synovitis and tenosynovitis, 3) anterior transverse scan at the coracoacromiale window in the neutral position, 4) at maximal external rotation and 5) at maximal internal rotation to evaluate the rotator cuff, bursitis, synovitis and erosions, 6) anterior longitudinal scan at 90° to the coracoacomiale window at maximal internal rotation to describe these findings in an additional dimension, 7) anterior-lateral longitudinal scan at the anterior lateral acromion to tuberculum majus to evaluate the distal part of the supraspinatus muscle, 8) posterior transverse scan at the fossa infra-spinata lateral under the spina scapulae, 9) axillary longitudinal scan to evaluate synovitis, synovial proliferation, erosions at the humeral head, lesions at the glenoidale labrum, 10) anterior transverse scan at the acromioclavicular joint and 11) anterior oblique scan at the sternoclavicular joint to detect synovitis, synovial proliferation, erosion, osteophytes.

N2  - Multiple rice body formation is a complication of chronic bursitis. Although it resembles synovial chondromatosis clinically and on imaging, the literature suggests that analysis of radiographic and MR appearances should allow discrimination. We report the imaging findings in a 41-year-old man presenting with rice body formation in chronic subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis. We found that the signal intensity of the rice bodies helpful in making the diagnosis.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to determine the intrarater and interrater reliability of a clinical evaluation system for scapular dysfunction. No commonly accepted terminology presently exists for describing the abnormal dynamic scapular movement patterns that are commonly associated with shoulder injury. A method of observation was devised for clinical evaluation of scapular dysfunction. Blinded evaluators (2 physicians and 2 physical therapists) were familiarized with the evaluation method of scapular movement patterns before viewing a videotape of 26 subjects with and without scapular dysfunction. Each evaluator was asked to categorize the predominant scapular movement pattern observed during bilateral humeral scaption and abduction motions. Reliability was assessed by a κ coefficient. Intertester reliability (κ = 0.4) was found to be slightly lower than intratester reliability (κ = 0.5). These results indicate that, with refinement, this qualitative evaluation method may allow clinicians to standardize the categorization of dynamic scapular dysfunction patterns.

N2  - External shoulder impingement is commonly diagnosed by passively moving the shoulder into various positions of elevation and internal rotation in order to perform impingement sign maneuvers. There is a lack of agreement among clinicians regarding the positions of the anatomic structures in the subacromial space when these maneuvers are performed. The purpose of this study was to use magnetic resonance imaging to identify and measure the changes in anatomic structures in the subacromial space as the arm was moved from complete rest to 160° of forward flexion during the Neer and Hawkins impingement sign maneuvers. Ten subjects with normal shoulders (mean age, 32 years) were studied. The acromiohumeral interval was smallest with the arm at the side (mean, 6.4 mm) and progressively increased as the arm was elevated from 90° to 160° (mean, 7.7-14.2 mm). In no instance was the rotator cuff found to be in contact with the anterior acromion. The rotator cuff insertion appeared to be in closest proximity to the anteroinferior acromion, not at full elevation (Neer sign position), but at 90° of flexion (Hawkins sign position). Our data suggest that a clinically positive Hawkins sign is consistent with external shoulder impingement. Clinical suspicion that mechanisms other than impingement may be involved, particularly if the Neer impingement sign is also positive, is nonetheless advised.

N2  - Os acromiale is an uncommon cause of shoulder pain with symptoms often resulting from an unstable meso-acromion. The associated pain may be due to impingement from the unfused fragment, a concomitant rotator cuff tear, or gross motion at the os acromiale site. Currently, initial treatment includes physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and subacromial corticosteroid injections. Surgical intervention is reserved for patients who do not respond to nonoperative treatment. Treatment options include open fragment excision, open reduction and internal fixation, and arthroscopic decompression. Open fragment excision can lead to persistent deltoid dysfunction and should be reserved for small fragments or after failed internal fixation. Open reduction and internal fixation allows for both preservation of large fragments and anterior deltoid function. Internal fixation is technically difficult, has led to frequent nonunion rates and often requires hardware removal as a result of postoperative irritation. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression with complete or nearly complete resection of the unstable meso-acromion can be performed without the aforementioned complications. The surgical technique requires no special instrumentation and may be performed reproducibly by those familiar with arthroscopic techniques of the shoulder. Advantages include more rapid rehabilitation, better range of motion, and shorter surgical times. Satisfactory short-term results have shown this to be an effective treatment option for the unstable meso-acromion.

Main Outcome Measures: Shoulder IR ROM was measured by using a digital inclinometer with each of the 3 techniques. All measurements were performed independently by 2 groups of examiners and repeated to determine intra- and interrater reliabilities. Results: IR ROM measurements obtained with the scapula stabilized or by visual inspection were significantly less than when measured with the standard technique (P=.001). Intrarater reliability was good or excellent for all 3 methods (intraclass correlation coefficients =.63-.71), was similar for the scapular stabilization and visual inspection techniques, and was superior to that previously reported for similar measurements. In general, interrater reliability was lower than intrarater reliability for all measurements. Conclusion: Because the visual inspection and scapular stabilized techniques control for accessory scapulothoracic motion, these techniques may represent more valid measures of glenohumeral motion than the standard technique. Both the visual inspection and scapular stabilized techniques exhibited equally acceptable reliability for clinical use. However, because the visual inspection technique may be applied by a single examiner, we recommend its use to measure shoulder IR ROM in the clinical setting. © 2002 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

N2  - Context: Although the repositioning test is widely used to evaluate proprioception, the effects of several test-associated variables on the test outcome are not known. Objective: To determine the effects of mode of movement, scapular support, and arm orientation on shoulder-position sense. Participants: 49 healthy, randomly selected men. Methods: The repositioning test was conducted in 4 settings in which mode of movement, scapular support, and arm orientation were manipulated differently. Main Outcome Measure: Position-sense acuity was quantified as repositioning accuracy and consistency. Results: Active limb movement significantly enhanced repositioning accuracy and consistency compared with passive movement. Repositioning consistency was significantly better when the scapula was supported than when it was not. Arm orientation had no significant effect on repositioning accuracy and consistency. Conclusion: The protocol for evaluating or rehabilitating shoulder proprioception should include active limb movement with the scapula unsupported to ensure that it reflects a patient's proprioceptive demand during functional activities.

N2  - Biomechanical investigations are yet necessary to better understand the origin of the glenoïd loosening which is the main reason for revision surgery. The aim of this study was to analyse the behaviour of cadaveric glenoïds before and after implantation of glenoïd prostheses. For that, we developed a new experimental protocol allowing measurement of bone strains and implants displacements under various loading cases. Ten pairs of fresh cadaveric scapulae were tested. Two kinds of loads were applied on the intact glenoïd: physiological loads corresponding to a 0-180° abduction and anteflexion movements, and 500N loads. The glenoïds were then implanted with a keeled or pegged cemented polyethylene implant. The same previous 500N loads were then applied on the implanted glenoïds. Strains were measured using six strain gages placed on precise points around the peripheral cortex of the glenoïd. Displacements of implants under loading were measured using two CCD cameras. Maximum strains were obtained between 60° and 120° of abduction or anteflexion. They were located at the anterior and antero-superior parts of the glenoïd during abduction and at the posterior and postero-superior parts during anteflexion. Implantation of a prosthetic component generally seemed to increase strains, but tensile strains were decreased at the postero-inferior part with the antero-inferior loading point. Some differences were observed between the implants, but they have to be confirmed by further experiments. The great number of data obtained for intact scapulae could be used for a better understanding of glenoïd behaviour and for validation of finite element models. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

N2  - Purpose of the study: The purpose of this work was to develop a goniometer with six degrees of freedom (6DOF) to achieve global measurement of the main movements of the shoulder and to examine the reproducibility of the measurements obtained. Material and methods: Movement amplitudes, inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of the methodology and the device were tested in a population of ten young subjects with asymptomatic shoulders. Results: Maximal amplitudes obtained for each movement were: abduction 111.8±11°; flexion 127.9±12.7; external rotation 86.3±14°; free elevation 129.3±9°. The curves traced in the plane of rotation and rotation were plotted against elevation. Comparison between amplitudes on the right and left were not significantly different. Discussion and conclusion: This preliminary study demonstrated the potential contribution of a 6DOF-goniometer for a 3D assessment of shoulder movement. Measurements made when positioning the goniometer demonstrated good reproducibility. Our data are similar to others reported in the literature. The plane of the scapula and the position in physiological internal rotation, as described in the literature, were also observed. Studying shoulder movements, particularly their association, should provide a new means of assessing function in patients with complex disease of the shoulder joint. The device should be helpful in obtaining an objective measurement of the shoulder kinetics that would be useful for patient follow-up and assessment of corporal damage.

N2  - Trunk forward lean (TFL) has been identified as a postural adaptation to increases in backpack load, and spinal forces have been presumed based on TFL. This pilot project examined the combined effects of increasing backpack load and task demand on TFL. Two boys with typical development, aged 11 and 9, were participants. Peak5 Motion Analysis Videography was used to gather 2D kinematic data under three levels of backpack load (0%, 8.5% and 17% body weight) and three levels of task demand (stand, walk and run). Passive reflective markers were placed on anatomical landmarks, and TFL was calculated by the angle formed by a line joining the right acromion and right greater trochanter and a vertical reference line. Descriptive statistics were performed to compare TFL under the nine experimental conditions. Although TFL most often increased with increases in backpack load and task demand, TFL was not dose dependent. Postural patterns varied between participants, and the findings supported a ceiling effect. In conclusion, to compensate for changes in inertia and center of gravity when wearing a backpack, TFL represents a dynamic emergent strategy that varies based on task demand and characteristics of the individual. Further research on TFL is warranted, and clinicians should be cautious when recommending safe carrying loads for children based on posture.

N2  - Objective. To investigate whether there is any repeatable coupling pattern of upper thoracic movements, during right arm elevation in sagittal and scapular plane. Methods. Upper thoracic movement patterns (T2-T7) were examined during right arm elevation, in the sagittal and scapular plane using an electromagnetic device. The participants were 25 asymptomatic woman aged between 45 and 64 years. Results. The majority of the participants performed an ipsilateral coupling pattern between lateral flexion and rotation which was repeatable and comparable for both arm elevation planes. Ipsilateral coupling of right lateral flexion and rotation in association with extension occurred in 23 subjects during arm elevation in sagittal plane, and in 19 subjects during arm elevation in scapular plane. Conclusions. Analysis revealed that the participants demonstrated a repeatable upper thoracic movement pattern within and between subjects, during arm elevation in sagittal and scapular planes. The biomechanical relationship between the arm and the thoracic spine is important to clinical practice because of the contribution of spinal to shoulder movements and vice versa, in the recognition, prevention and restoration of musculoskeletal function. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

N2  - The aim of this study was to compare thoracic spine alignment with two- and three-dimensional calculations of shoulder alignment (defined as a line joining the acromion processes of the right and left scapula) when all measures were projected onto the transverse plane. A six-camera Vicon system was used to reconstruct three markers positioned on the plane of the thorax such that the orthogonal vector to the thoracic spine, projected onto the transverse plane, was used as a virtual shoulder alignment during cricket fast bowling. This same measurement system was used to calculate the three-dimensional line between the acromion processes projected onto the transverse plane. These acromion markers were also used to calculate the two-dimensional transverse plane alignment of the shoulders from images recorded by a video camera positioned above ball release. All cameras operated at 50 Hz. A significant association was recorded between thorax alignment and the three- (0.97) and two-dimensional (0.87) shoulder alignment estimations at back-foot impact. The strength of association remained at front-foot impact, when correlations of 0.89 (three-dimensional) and 0.84 (two-dimensional) were recorded. However, at ball release, non-significant associations of 0.58 (three-dimensional) and 0.41 (two-dimensional), representing shoulder alignment differences of approximately 10°, were recorded. The 95% limits of agreement comparisons for shoulder alignment at back-foot impact, front-foot impact and ball release produced mean random errors for the two comparisons of 9.5°, 11.7° and 22.5° respectively. Three- and two-dimensional transverse plane projections of shoulder alignment are reasonable estimates of thorax alignment at back-foot impact and front-foot impact but not at ball release.

N2  - A key feature in physiotherapeutic treatment of patients with motion disturbances is the appropriate ranging of the trunk and pelvis motility. Eighty subjects randomly selected and free from known pathology of the muscular-skeletal and/or of the neurological system classed into four groups according to the age and the sex have been assessed, by using a new, simple and easy administrable tool. Our results demonstrate that the new measurement tool showed a very low intra- and inter-observer variability, that healthy subjects showed a more adduced and elevated right scapula if compared to the contralateral one and, as regard as the pelvic motion, a broader joint excursion in passive motion compared with active motion in the overall group, a broader joint excursion in young subjects compared with elderly ones, and a broader joint excursion in female subjects compared with males subjects. In conclusion our study allowed to identify a range of physiological asymmetry and pelvis motility. Such a range of physiological asymmetry might be useful as a reference for the physiotherapists.

N2  - A review was made of experiments on humans in which air trapping by glottis closure during three-dimensional movements were examined in four subjects including former Olympic gymnasts. In brachiation and horizontal bar exercises, the behaviour of the larynx was monitored with a fiberoptic endoscope, and EMG-data were recorded from shoulder muscles. The results revealed that immobilization of the polyaxial connection between the shoulder girdle and the thorax by air trapping occurs in phases of extreme loading of the upper limbs. The closure of the airway by the larynx in humans serves three functions: first, the prevention of errors in deglutition; second, the production of vocal sounds; third, the retention of air inside the thoracic cavity. The latter function, air trapping, allows the immobilization of the rib cage for the muscular fixation of the shoulder blade on the trunk in movements that imply unusually high external forces acting on the upper limbs. This morphological-functional innovation probably has been made when early mammals invaded the three dimensional arboreal habitat, because it gave the tree-dwelling early primates the device to anchor themselves by the arms alone and to avoid falling out of trees. The specific functional characteristic of primates is the hermetic closure of the vocal and vestibular folds by rapidly contracting muscles in the folds. So the closure of the glottis, which in humans seems primarily an adaptation to the production of vocal tones, seems to go back to the adaptation of Tertiary arboreal primates to movements in a three-dimensional environment. Our conclusions are in agreement with the results of other contributions to this volume.

N2  - Objective: To compare three dimensional movement patterns of the affected and non-affected shoulder in patients with a frozen shoulder before and after physical therapy. Methods: Patients with a unilateral frozen shoulder were assessed before and after three months of treatment. Three dimensional movement analysis was performed with the "Flock of Birds" electromagnetic tracking device while the patient raised their arms in three directions. Slopes of the regression lines of glenohumeral joint rotation versus scapular rotation, reflecting the scapulohumeral rhythm, were calculated. All assessments were made for both the affected and the unaffected side. Additional assessments included conventional range of motion (ROM) measurements and visual analogue scales (VAS) (0-100 mm) for shoulder pain at rest, during movement, and at night. Results: Ten patients with a unilateral frozen shoulder were included. The slopes of the curves of the forward flexion, scapular abduction, and abduction in the frontal plane of the affected and the unaffected side were significantly different in all three movement directions. Mean differences were 0.267, 0.215, and 0.464 (all p values <0.005), respectively. Mean changes of the slopes of the affected side after treatment were 0.063 (p=0.202), 0.048 (p=0.169), and 0.264 (p=0.008) in forward flexion, scapular abduction, and abduction in the frontal plane, respectively. All patients showed significant improvement in active ROM (all p<0.005), and the VAS for pain during movement and pain at night (p<0.05). Conclusions: With a three dimensional electromagnetic tracking system the abnormal movement pattern of a frozen shoulder, characterised by the relatively early laterorotation of the scapula in relation to glenohumeral rotation during shoulder elevation, can be described and quantified. Moreover, the system is sufficiently sensitive to detect clinical improvements. Its value in other shoulder disorders remains to be established.

N2  - Study Design: Test-retest reliability study and single-group repeated measures design. Objectives: To evaluate the muscle latency times of the 3 portions of the trapezius muscle to a sudden arm movement in normal shoulders and to determine if this recruitment pattern is altered as a result of fatigue. Background: It has been suggested that shoulder impingement may be related to altered muscle activity and muscle fatigue in the scapular stabilizers. Fatigue-induced changes in latency times of the trapezius might influence scapular stability. Methods and Measures: Muscle latency times were investigated in 30 healthy shoulders with surface electromyography. Muscle activity was measured in all 3 sections of the trapezius and the middle deltoid muscle during a sudden downward falling movement of the arm. Subsequently the shoulder was fatigued on an isokinetic dynamometer, after which muscle latency time measurement was repeated. Results: ANOVA for repeated measures revealed significant differences in latency times (P < 0.05) among the 4 muscles of interest. Although there were no significant differences among the 3 sections of the trapezius muscle, they all were recruited after the initialization of the deltoid muscle. The recruitment order of the shoulder muscles did not change with muscle fatigue. However, after fatigue, muscle responses were significantly slower in all muscles except for the lower trapezius (P < 0.05). Conclusions: There is a specific recruitment sequence in the shoulder muscles in response to a sudden arm movement characterized by initial activation of the middle deltoid muscle and followed by simultaneous contraction of all 3 sections of the trapezius. This muscle activation pattern is delayed but not altered with fatigue.

N2  - Objective. The first aim of this study was an approach to quantify the 3D kinematics of the glenohumeral joint referred to the joint surfaces. The method was used to study the glenohumeral patho-arthrokinematics related to minor anterior instability at the end of the late preparatory phase of throwing.Study design. Using a finite helical axis approach, arthrokinematics focused on: (i) the rotations and shift of the humeral head on the glenoid cavity, and (ii) the migration of contact of the articular surfaces. Background. Controversy still exists whether the clinical syndrome called `minor anterior glenohumeral instability' can be validly termed as an instability. Methods. Helical CT-data of discrete shoulder positions were three-dimensionally reconstructed. Based on humeral and scapular sets of skeletal landmarks, rotation matrices and translation vectors were estimated and processed in glenohumeral finite helical axes. The finite helical axis parameters of rotation, shift and direction were related to a co-ordinate system embedded on the glenoid, whereas the position of the finite helical axis was related to the articulating surface of the humeral head. Results. From 90° abduction and 90° external rotation to full cocking (90° abduction with full external rotation and horizontal extension), the humeral head in the normal shoulders did not externally/internally rotate on the glenoid. In contrast, a large external rotation component was found in the minor unstable shoulders. The geometrical centre of the humeral head of the normal shoulders translated into a posteriorized position on the glenoid, whereas in minor anterior instability it translated centrally on the glenoid. Conclusions. Compared with in vitro biomechanical research which states that towards full cocking the anterior part of the inferior glenohumeral ligament limits anterior translation and external rotation of the humeral head on the glenoid, the results suggest in minor anterior instability a dysfunction of the anterior part of the inferior glenohumeral ligament. Relevance The results indicate that the so-called `minor anterior glenohumeral instability syndrome' can validly be stated as an instability problem. The results also indicate that the glenohumeral joint does not move consistently as a ball-and-socket joint, meaning that the concave-convex rules for glenohumeral joint mobilization need `evidence-based' adjustments.

N2  - The shoulder joint is a complex structure composed of intricate bony architecture and an ornate system of muscles, tendons, and ligaments. What many refer to as the "shoulder joint" is actually a combination of 4 articulations - the glenohumeral joint, acromioclavicular joint, sternoclavicular joint, and the scapulothoracic articulation. These structures work together to provide the shoulder complex with multiple degrees of freedom, which allow the upper extremity to be abducted, adducted, rotated, flexed, and extended. Although this flexibility is vital for positioning the arm in space, it can make the evaluation of pathology difficult. Furthermore, neck pathology can refer pain to the shoulder, which may require a screening evaluation of the neck. This article reviews the relevant anatomy and discusses an approach to the differential diagnosis of shoulder pain.

N2  - Objectives: To determine whether scapular downward tilt (ScDT) and dynamic scapular lateral rotation (ScLR) in subjects with and without stroke is associated with subluxation, and to prove the reliability of a Scapula Locator System in an elderly population. Design: Repeated measures of ScLR by 2 observers. Setting: Outpatient rehabilitation department of a district general hospital. Participants: To test device reliability, 5 healthy men (mean age ± standard deviation, 72 ± 5yr). To test scapula position, 30 stroke patients (19 men, 11 women; mean age, 73 ± 6yr) and 15 healthy controls (12 men, 3 women; mean age, 62 ± 6yr). Interventions: The control subjects' ScDT was compared with stroke subjects' ScDT after stratification according to 3 patterns of ScLR symmetry and the presence of palpable glenohumeral subluxation. Main Outcome Measures: For device reliability, 3-way analysis of variance. For scapula position, triangulated location by Scapula Locator System of acromion, inferior angle, and root of the scapular spine; then measurement of scapula motion to determine symmetry, lag, or lead, Results: The inter- and intraobserver reliability of the Scapula Locator System device was high (1% of variance each). Normal ScDT was positive (left side: 10.94° ± 2.62°; right side: 9.69° + 4.36°), indicating a downward-facing glenoid fossa. This finding was unchanged by stroke (10.46° ± 2.42°). All controls and 16 stroke subjects had symmetry between shoulders for ScLR rate and ScDT. Two other patterns (p < .01) of ScLR were found after stroke: 8 subjects had a slower rate of affected arm ScLR (lag) with a correspondingly greater ScDT on the affected side (2.61° ± 6.7°); 6 subjects had a faster rate of affected arm ScLR (lead) but with an upward-facing glenoid fossa on the affected side (ScDT: -11.84° ± 8.48°). No significant inter- or intrasubject difference in ScDT existed in the 6 cases of glenohumeral subluxation. Conclusions: The scapula normally tilts downward with or without stroke. The effect of stroke is similar on tonic (ScDT) and phasic (ScLR) control of scapula position. Subluxation is not linked with a particular scapular resting position after stroke.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate the validity and the reliability of the main clinical measures of mobility and sagittal spinal curves in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Methods: Criterion validity of the measure of the distance between C7 spinous process to plumbline (dorsal kyphosis), L3-plumb line (lumbar lordosis), lumbar, dorsolumbar and dorsal mobility. The gold standard was the value obtained from lateral radiological views of the dorsal and lumbar spine in standing position and maximum flexion. The correlation between radiological and clinical measures was assessed by a Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC). The reliability was assessed for all the clinical parameters and for chin-sternum distance (flexion, extension), chin-acromion distance (rotations) and chest expansion using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the Bland and Altman method. Were included patients with AS and needing dorsal and lumbar Xrays. Results: Twenty-two patients (21 men), 32 ± 11 year old, 51 ± 10 kg weight, with a mean duration of the disease of 120 ± 60 months. The ICC values were good or excellent for all parameters except for the measures of dorsal mobility. The validity was evaluated in 18 patients. The value of the SCC between clinical and radiological measures was good except the measures of dorsal kyphosis and dorsal mobility. Conclusion: The clinical measures of mobility and sagittal curves have metrological properties good enough to be used in the monitoring of AS mainly for the follow-up and the evaluation of the rehabilitation. The measurement of dorsal mobility should be restricted to the lower part only. Although apparently not valid the distance C7-plumbline can be used in management of AS because of its excellent reliability. © 2001 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

N2  - The validation of two noninvasive methods for measuring the dynamic three-dimensional kinematics of the human scapula with a magnetic tracking device is presented. One method consists of simply fixing a sensor directly to the acromion and the other consists of mounting a sensor to an adjustable plastic jig that fits over the scapular spine and acromion. The concurrent validity of both methods was assessed separately by comparison with data collected simultaneously from an invasive approach in which pins were drilled directly into the scapula. The differences between bone and skin based measurements represents an estimation of skin motion artifact. The average motion pattern of each surface method was similar to that measured by the invasive technique, especially below 120 degrees of elevation. These results indicate that with careful consideration, both methods may offer reasonably accurate representations of scapular motion that may be used to study shoulder pathologies and help develop computational models.

N2  - Study Design: Test-retest repeated measures and correlational design. Objectives: To examine the reliability and validity of a "modified" digital inclinometer to assess scapular upward rotation during humeral elevation in the scapular plane Background: Evidence exists that scapular motion is related to shoulder pathology; however, evaluation and treatment planning for shoulder rehabilitation often fails to include an objective assessment of scapular motion. Methods and Measures: Two-dimensional measurements by the inclinometer were taken with the arm in a static position. These data were compared to 3-dimensional measurements obtained using a magnetic tracking device with the arm fixed and during arm movement. Both methods were used to assess scapular upward rotation positions with the arm at rest and at 60°, 90°, and 120° of humeral elevation in the scapular plane. Both scapulae were tested on a total of 39 subjects, 16 with shoulder pathology and 23 without. Reliability was assessed using repeated measurements from the inclinometer. Validity was assessed using 2 separate comparisons: inclinometer and magnetic tracking device under static arm conditions and inclinometer and magnetic tracking device during active arm elevation. Reliability and validity were assessed at all 4 arm positions. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC [3,1]) varied from 0.89 to 0.96. Pearson Product Moment correlation coefficients, used to assess validity of the static inclinometer, varied from r = 0.74 to 0.92 compared with the static magnetic tracking measures, and from r = 0.59 to 0.73 compared with the active magnetic tracking measures taken during arm elevation. Conclusions: The "modified" digital inclinometer demonstrated good to excellent intrarater reliability and good to excellent validity when measuring scapular upward rotation during static positions of humeral elevation in the scapular plane.

N2  - This study has investigated the reliability of an isokinetic testing protocol for the shoulder rotators in the scapular plane to estimate the minimum variation of rotator moment needed to detect a significant change between two tests. Concentric and eccentric actions of shoulder internal and external rotation were assessed in a group of 31 male students. Measurements were performed on the dominant and non-dominant sides, at 60 and 120°·s-1, using an isokinetic dynamometer. Each volunteer was assessed in the seated position, with the arm at 45° of abduction and 30° of horizontal adduction. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 3,1), the standard error of measurement (SEM) and the limits of agreement (LOA) were used to determine inter-session reliability and the magnitude of the measurement error for gravity corrected peak and average moment. Moderate to high ICC values (0.76-0.93) were observed for all measured variables. The measurement error associated with repeated measures ranged between 3.9-13.3 Nm. Both SEM and LOA revealed greater measurement errors for peak compared to average moment, eccentric compared to concentric actions, and internal compared to external rotation. The findings of the present study suggested that decline or improvement in isokinetic shoulder rotator moment should only be considered as a significant response to a pathology or an intervention, when the moment data obtained in consecutive repeated measures is lower or greater than the measurement error.

N2  - During isokinetic shoulder elevation in the coronal and sagittal planes, the centre of rotation of the glenohumeral joint was displaced 8-cm vertically relative to the centre of rotation of the dynamometer's actuator arm. It was suggested that in order to account for this displacement, the recorded maximum moment values should be reduced by 12.5%. The aim of the present study was to measure the displacement of the glenohumeral centre of rotation (DGCR) during isokinetic shoulder elevation in the scapular plane and to conduct an error analysis of the dynamometer's moment recordings. The DGCR was assessed in twenty healthy volunteers, during isokinetic concentric elevation of the left shoulder, in the scapular plane, using a two-dimension motion analysis system. Measurements were performed at 30, 60 and 120°·s-1, between 30-90° of shoulder elevation and were analysed every 12°. The glenohumeral centre of rotation was superomedially displaced relative to the centre of rotation of the actuator arm, throughout shoulder elevation (P < 0.001). The effect of isokinetic velocity on the DGCR was not significant. The DGCR resulted also in changes of humeral lever arm orientation and length relative to the pre-set orientation and length of lever arm. As a result of these changes, dynamometer's recordings underestimated corrected angle-based maximum moments by ≤ 6.2%. The DGCR during isokinetic elevation of the shoulder in the scapular plane was probably attributed to normal kinematics of shoulder elevation that requires synchronous function of both the scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joints. The cutaneous markers and the 2-D kinematic analysis system used for the assessment of a 3-D shoulder motion may effect the precision in detecting movements of the shoulder under the skin. The present findings are also limited to the position, stabilisation method and range of motion tested.

N2  - The reliability of gravity corrected average and peak isokinetic moment of the shoulder elevators in the scapular plane, was assessed in 22 male college students without shoulder or neck pathology. Measurements were performed on two occasions, 7 days apart, by the same examiner. Both dominant and non-dominant sides were examined at 60 and 120°·s-1, using Kin Com II dynamometer. Each volunteer was assessed in the seated position, elevating the shoulder between 30-90° with the elbow in extension and the forearm in pronation. Reliability of both non-free and free of transient moment-oscillations (TMO) peak and average moment data (data selected from the entire range and the range of motion where isokinetic velocity was constant and equal to the pre-selected angular velocity, respectively) was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 3,1). The variability of isokinetic moment data associated with normal fluctuations of strength performance over repeated measurements (inter-session variability) was determined using the standard error of measurement (SEM) and the limits of agreement (LOA). The ICC (3,1) values ranged between 0.86-0.95. Inter-sessions variability of isokinetic moment data calculated using 95% SEM and 95% LOA were similar and ranged between 8.9-15.9 Nm. Both SEM and LOA revealed lower variability for average compared to peak moment data, non-free compared to free of TMO average moment and for free compared to non-free of TMO peak moment data. Higher ICC values and lower variability was also obtained for peak moment data at the isokinetic velocity of 60 compared to 120°·s-1 and for most of the moment data recorded on the dominant compared to the non-dominant side. The present findings suggest that strength changes observed over repeated isokinetic measurements of the shoulder elevators in the scapular plane, may be better identified under certain conditions but they should only be considered as significant changes if they are lower or greater than inter-session variability of isokinetic moment data.

N2  - Scapular position has been hypothesized to influence rotator cuff function, but no current methods exist to reliably measure shoulder rotation strength in different scapular positions. The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable technique to measure isokinetic (ISOK) and isometric (ISOM) shoulder rotation strength with the scapula protracted. Ten healthy volunteers (5 male, 5 female, ages 20-41) completed two to three ISOM and five ISOK (90 degrees/second) internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) repetitions in a position of scapular protraction with the shoulder abducted 45 degrees in the scapular plane. Subjects returned 24-72 hours later to repeat testing. All torque measurements in the protracted position exhibited excellent intersession reliability (ICCs > 0.97). Shoulder rotational torque can be measured in the protracted scapula position with excellent reliability using the new technique described. Establishing the reliability of the protracted technique is a necessary prerequisite for the completion of future studies examining quantitative differences in rotational torque generation between the neutral and protracted scapula positions in the functional shoulder position of 45 degrees of scapular plane abduction.

N2  - Within the framework of the current call for standardization in upper extremity research, three methods to determine the glenohumeral joint rotation centre in vivo were tested. Therefore, subjects performed humeral movements, while a 3D electromagnetic tracking device registered the motion of the humerus with respect to the scapula. For the first method to estimate the glenohumeral joint rotation centre five scapular bony landmarks served as input to regression equations. The second method fitted a sphere through the humeral position data and the third method calculated the rotation centre determining an optimal helical axis. The experiment consisted of two parts, at first one subject was measured 10 times, subsequently one observer measured 10 subjects twice and another observer measured these subjects once. The first part of the experiment demonstrated that all methods are capable to reproduce the rotation centre within 4mm, but the location of the centre differed significantly between methods (p<0.001). The second part, showed that inter- and intra-observer reliability was sufficiently for the sphere-fitting method and for the helical-axes method. The two observations of one observer differed significantly (p<0.008) using the regression method. The authors prefer the helical-axes method, it is a reliable and valid method which can be applied in movement registration of healthy subjects and patients with a shoulder endoprosthesis, it can be applied in hinge joints to determine a rotation axis instead of a rotation centre which is desirable in standardized upper extremity research, and calculation time is short.

N2  - To validate the assumption that the center of rotation in the glenohumeral (GH) joint can be described based on the geometry of the joint, two methods for calculation of the GH rotation center were compared. These are a kinematic estimation based on the calculation of instantaneous helical axes, and a geometric estimation based on a spherical fit through the surface of the glenoid. Four fresh cadaver arms were fixed at the scapula and fitted with electromagnetic sensors. Each arm was moved in different directions while at the same time the orientation of the humerus was recorded. Subsequently, each specimen was dissected and its glenoid and humeral head surfaces were digitized. Results indicate no differences between the methods. It is concluded that the method to estimate the GH center of rotation as the center of a sphere through the glenoid surface, with the radius of the humeral head, appears to be valid.

N2  - The anatomy and biomechanics of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint have been understood for a long time; however, the importance of this joint in the clinical setting is often underestimated. During clinical examination various sensitive functional tests can document any AC pathology. For X-ray documentation special techniques are necessary. Other imaging techniques are rarely indicated. The Rockwood classification for AC joint separation has increased our understanding of the pathology, which, in turn, leads to a better understanding of conservative and surgical therapy. Within the last few decades surgical treatment has shifted from AC to coracoclavicular stabilization. In patients with clinically relevant degenerative joint disease, resection of the lateral clavicle has proved to be a reproducible procedure. This operation can be performed using the conventional, open technique or with a minimally invasive procedure (arthroscopic resection of the AC joint; ARAC). In unstable joints, resection should be combined with a stabilization procedure.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To use two commonly accepted measurement techniques to determine whether intense swimming exercise altered scapular position in male high school swimmers. Scapular position differences between dominant and nondominant shoulders were also investigated. DESIGN: A pilot study on 10 asymptomatic male volunteers established the reliability of the scapular position measurement techniques described by DiVeta and Kibler (intratester intraclass correlation coefficients 0.86-0.98). Scapular position was prospectively recorded before and after swimming practice just prior to tapering for championship competition. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty male high school swimmers from two local teams, ages 13 to 18 years. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects completed their usual 2-hour swimming practice at the peak of their training intensity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in scapular position preexercise versus postexercise. RESULTS: Scapular position did not change preexercise to postexercise for either the DiVeta (22.2 +/- 1.4 to 22.3 +/- 1.5 cm, p = 0.96) or Kibler (9.2 +/- 1.4 to 9.4 +/- 1.3 cm, p = 1.00) measures. Nondominant preexercise scapular position was generally more medial and moved laterally with exercise, becoming roughly equivalent to the dominant shoulder. CONCLUSION: The DiVeta and Kibler scapular position measurement techniques are acceptably reliable. However these techniques generally failed to demonstrate significant changes in scapular position after intense swimming exercise in the study population. Nondominant side scapulae typically moved laterally postexercise. These findings and implications are discussed.

N2  - The kinematics of the human arm in terms of angles of rotations in the joints is reconstructed from the spatial tracking system (Fastrack((TM)) Polhemus) recordings. The human arm is modeled by three rigid bodies (the upper arm, the forearm and the hand) with seven degrees of freedom (three in the shoulder, two in the elbow and two in the wrist). Joint geometry parameters (orientations of the axes relative to the arm segments, the angles and the distances between the axes) have been calculated on the basis of passive rotations in the joints. The calculated parameters have been used to solve the direct kinematics problem for the reaching movements in different directions. The difference between calculated and recorded positions and accelerations of the hand has been used to assess the accuracy of the proposed method of kinematics reconstruction. The error analysis showed that spatial tracking system recordings and human arm kinematics reconstruction could reliably be used to accurately analyze multijoint movement in humans.

N2  - Objectives: To study the effect of a recently described method of measuring shoulder rotational range of motion in which the scapula is manually stabilized, and to determine the reliability of that technique compared with measurements taken with the scapula unstabilized. Design: Fifty high school athletes underwent measurement of shoulder rotational range of motion with and without the scapula manually stabilized. Measurements were performed by two groups of physical therapists blinded to the movement results, with repeat measurements performed 5 days later. Results: Rotational motion measured with the scapula stabilized was significantly less than when it was measured with the scapula unstabilized. Reliability was comparable for the two techniques when measuring external rotation, but the new technique was more reliable for measuring internal rotation. Conclusion: Scapular stabilization should be used when measuring internal rotation of the shoulder to obtain more accurate measurement of pure glenohumeral rotation. The technique described is promising, but warrants further refinement before it can be recommended for widespread clinical use. With practice, in experienced clinicians' hands, this technique may be the most reliable method for measuring outcome in clinical trials and for following clinically significant rotational motion deficits.

N2  - Objective. In a previous retrospective study, we had found that shoulder radiographs were overused in the initial evaluation of patients presenting to the emergency department with shoulder pain. Our objective was to prospectively define clinical criteria that identify patients who have a low risk of radiographic findings that influence the management of the initial evaluation of shoulder pain in the emergency department. Methods. All adult patients presenting to the emergency department of a university teaching hospital with shoulder pain were eligible to participate. Patients with deformities, penetrating wounds, referred pain, and those presenting for followup were excluded. Data were recorded prospectively using a standardized form. All radiographs were classified as therapeutically uninformative (TU) except fracture, acromioclavicular joint separation (≥ Grade 3), infection, or malignancy. A classification tree was used for analysis. Results. Two hundred six patients had shoulder radiographs, of which 88% were TU. The model yielded 3 sets of low risk patients with a high percentage of TU radiographs: (1) no fall, no swelling (99% TU: 106 TU, 1 radiograph with lyric lesions in a cancer patient); (2) a fall, but no swelling, and no pain at rest (100% TU, n = 18); (3) a fall and pain at rest, but no swelling and normal range of motion (100% TU, n = 10). Not performing radiographs on these low risk patients would have decreased radiograph utilization from 52 to 18% of all shoulder patients seen. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that specific clinical criteria are able to identify patients who do not need radiographs as part of the initial management of shoulder pain. Prospective validation of these criteria are needed to confirm that these low risk patients can be safely evaluated without radiographs.

N2  - Objective. To develop a method to obtain accurate three-dimensional scapular attitudes and to assess their concurrent validity and reliability. Study design. In this methodological study, the three-dimensional scapular attitudes were calculated in degrees, using a rotation matrix (cyclic Cardanic sequence), from spatial coordinates obtained with the probing of three non colinear landmarks first on an anatomical model and second on a healthy subject. Background. Although abnormal movement of the scapula is related to shoulder impingement syndrome, it is not clearly understood whether or not scapular motion impairment is a predisposing factor. Characterization of three-dimensional scapular attitudes in planes and at joint angles for which sub-acromial impingement is more likely to occur is not known. Methods. The Optotrak probing system was used. An anatomical model of the scapula was built and allowed us to impose scapular attitudes of known direction and magnitude. A local coordinate reference system was defined with three non colinear anatomical landmarks to assess accuracy and concurrent validity of the probing method with fixed markers. Axial rotation angles were calculated from a rotation matrix using a cyclic Cardanic sequence of rotations. The same three non colinear body landmarks were digitized on one healthy subject and the three dimensional scapular attitudes obtained were compared between sessions in order to assess the reliability. Results and conclusions. The measure of three dimensional scapular attitudes calculated from data using the Optotrak probing system was accurate with means of the differences between imposed and calculated rotation angles ranging from 1.5°to 4.2°. Greatest variations were observed around the third axis of the Cardanic sequence associated with posterior-anterior transverse rotations. The mean difference between the Optotrak probing system method and fixed markers was 1.73°showing a good concurrent validity. Differences between the two methods were generally very low for one and two direction displacements and the largest discrepancies were observed for imposed displacements combining movement about the three axes. The between sessions variation of three dimensional scapular attitudes was less than 10% for most of the arm positions adopted by a healthy subject suggesting a good reliablity. The Optotrak probing system used with a standardized protocol lead to accurate, valid and reliable measures of scapular attitudes. Relevance: Although abnormal range of motion of the scapula is often related to shoulder pathologies, reliable outcome measures to quantify three- dimensional scapular motion on subjects are not available. It is important to establish a standardized protocol to characterize three-dimensional scapular motion on subjects using a method for which the accuracy and validity are known. The method used in the present study has provided such a protocol and will now allow to verify to what extent, scapular motion impairment is linked to the development of specific shoulder pathologies.

N2  - Isokinetic testing of arm elevation in the scapular plane offers several advantages over the frontal plane. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the intraexaminer reproducibility of scapular plane (30°anterior to frontal plane) elevation peak torques using a Cybex 340 isokinetic dynamometer. Twelve female and three male (N = 15) noninjured college students were tested on three separate occasions over a six week interval. Dominant shoulder scapular plane elevation was measured with participants seated utilizing a modified abduction/adduction protocol. Testing consisted of four gradient sub-maximum to maximum warm-ups followed by five maximum repetitions at 60°/sec, 180°/sec, and 300°/sec. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) indicated that scapular plane elevation peak torques may be measured using these techniques with good reproducibility at 60°/sec (0.870) and 180°/sec (0.827), and fair reproducibility at 300°/sec (0.708). Results suggest that scapular plane arm elevation isokinetic testing should be conducted at slower angular-velocities to obtain more reproducible measurements.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a relationship between altered scapular plane glenohumeral kinematics end shoulder pain. Subjects were divided into 3 groups: normal volunteers (n = 10), patients with symptomatic rotator cuff tears severe enough to warrant surgery (n = 10), and subjects with no symptoms who had tears documented on magnetic resonance imaging and normal examination (n = 10). Humeral kinematics were observed with a computer-enhanced modification of the Poppen and Walker technique. Scapular plane x-ray films were obtained at 0 degree, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees, and 150 degrees of elevation. Measurements were made by 3 independent observers blinded to the diagnosis, and data interpretation was performed based on mean values for independent observers. Results showed a high degree of interobserver and intraobserver reliability (coefficients = 0.96 and 0.95, respectively). The symptomatic and asymptomatic groups showed progressive superior translation of the humeral head on the glenoid with increasing arm elevation. The normal group, in contrast, maintained a constant center of rotation along the geometric center of the glenoid. Symptomatic and asymptomatic rotator cuff tear groups showed superior head migration from 30 degrees to 150 degrees, which was significantly different from those seen in the normal group. No significant difference between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups was demonstrated with the small numbers used in this study. The presence of a rotator cuff tear was associated in a disruption of normal glenohumeral kinematics in the scapular plane. Because significant superior migration of the humeral head was seen in both the asymptomatic and symptomatic rotator cuff groups, painless and normal shoulder motion is possible in the presence of abnormal glenohumeral kinematics. Abnormal glenohumeral kinematics alone was not an independent factor, which could explain the occurrence of symptoms.

N2  - Although numerical models on the shoulder complex joint are currently available, many are impractical because of the procedural complexity coupled with limited and mere simple simulations. The present study defined the clavicle-scapula system as the "base of the humerus" in determining the position of proximal head of humerus, rendering conclusive innovation of a six degree of freedom (DOF) shoulder complex joint model. Furthermore, a complete measurement system where evaluation by calibrating the actual values via the use of an electromagnetic tracking device (ETD) was developed based on the innovated model. The special calibration method using optimizing calculation to work out the rotational center of humerus was employed and actually tested if the theoretical consideration was practically available. As a result of accuracy check experiments, the measurement error was defined within 2-3 mm, indicating sufficient accuracy in studies for human movement. Our findings strongly advocate that the benefit of this novel measurement system would contribute to studies related to shoulder movements in physiological anthropology.

N2  - The purpose of the study was to determine the variability of measurement that might occur with rotation of the scapula in the coronal plane when computed tomography scanning is used. Ten dry scapula specimens had 4 sets of computed tomography scans performed at +20 degrees, +10 degrees, neutral, and -10 degrees of scapula rotation. The angle of glenoid version was then measured according to the technique of Friedman. The measured value for glenoid version was noted to vary by as much as 10 degrees on the same specimen with minor rotation of the scapula. This result occurred because of differences in the curvature of the vertebral border of the scapula. The measured angle of glenoid version was most likely to vary with rotation of the scapula 10 degrees downward (i.e., glenoid articular surface facing 10 degrees upward). For accurate and reproducible measurement of the glenoid version, it is essential that in the scout view the glenoid orientation is neutral (i.e., glenoid surface is perpendicular to the plane of the computed tomography cut).

N2  - It has been hypothesized that shoulder myalgia, which is common in many occupations involving light-to-moderate manual work, is due to an overuse of low threshold muscle fibers, causing damage at the muscle cell level. The present study was undertaken to investigate in the trapezius muscle, (a) to what extent it is possible to track low threshold motor-units in non-isometric conditions, and (b) to study the effect of arm movements on recruitment and firing patterns. Intramuscular four lead fine wire electrodes were inserted in the trapezius muscle of four volunteers, who performed arm movements (shoulder abduction-adduction 0-90-0°in the scapula plane), as well as standardized work using computer mouse. Three channels of electromyography (EMG) were used for motor-unit action potential (MUAP) identification and signal decomposition. Results showed (a) that it was possible to perform signal tracking during slow movements, and (b) that there were motor-units that were active over a wide range of shoulder abduction movement, as well as in work with computer mouse. The findings indicate that stereotypic recruitment patterns exist in the trapezius muscle not only in static work, but also in work situations involving arm and shoulder movements.Relevance to industryOccupationally related chronic shoulder pain is an increasing problem in industry, in manual work as well as in computer work. This paper presents results of studies on muscular activity patterns during movements which support the notion that chronic pain may be evoked by overuse syndromes at the muscular fiber level. Practical precautions to reduce such risks are discussed. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

N2  - Previous studies have shown that abnormal rotation of the scapula is associated with shoulder pathology. Among the methods which have been proposed, planar x-ray measurements are probably the only methods, which enable clinicians to assess accurately and objectively the scapulohumeral function in vivo. The aim of this study was to develop a method for the assessment of scapulohumeral kinematics using digital fluoroscopy. Anteroposterior images of the right glenohumeral joint were taken, in thirty-four healthy males, with the arm at rest, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 150°and maximum abduction, in the scapular plane. High inter- and intra-examiner reliability was observed regarding the arm and scapular angle measurements (ICC = 0.92-0.99). The positioning of the arm at the proposed angles was also highly accurate (< 2.3°misplacement) and reproducible (CV% < 5.3%). The mean radiation dose was 0.075 mSv (± 0.027 mSv). At the resting position the scapula was in slight downward relation (-2.4°± 4.3°) and the arm in slight abduction (1.5°± 6.6°). The mean maximum scapular rotation and the mean maximum arm abduction was 61.4°(± 5.2°) and 162.4°(± 6.6°) respectively. A curvilinear relationship was found between the arm angle (AA) and the scapular angle (SA) (p < 0.0001). The AA:SA ratio for the entire range of abduction was 2.5:1. The greatest contribution of the scapula (1.7:1) achieved at 30°-60°of arm. The high accuracy and reliability of our method and the low radiation recordings suggests that digital fluoroscopy may be considered for further investigation of the scapulohumeral kinematics in both healthy and pathological shoulders.

N2  - This paper presents some results on the modelling and the corresponding parameter estimation of the human shoulder. This system consists of the clavicle, the scapula, the humerus and the various joints between these bodies and the trunk through the sternum; it will be represented as a succession of a rotational joint between the sternum and the clavicle and a constant distance joint, representing the scapula between, the clavicle and the humerus head. The parameters of this system are the components of the position vectors of the joint characteristic points (the corresponding centres of the rotations). Experimental results are presented as well as a validation of the proposed model. Copyright (C) 1999.

Discussion: The acromioclavicular joint differential test is performed by applying downward pressure over the lateral one third of the clavicle while passively inducing slight adduction, external rotation, and forced forward flexion to the humerus while the patient is in the seated position. Although similar mechanisms have been described, the acromioclavicular joint differential test is a new, previously unreported examination procedure. Conclusion: This article describes a new test to differentiate between acromioclavicular joint lesions and subacromial impingement. On the basis of its mechanism, the acromioclavicular joint differential test may provide the examiner with an additional tool in the differential diagnosis of acromioclavicular joint lesions and subacromial impingement in the patient with shoulder pain. Although this test has been used by the author in a clinical setting, validation data are not yet available.

N2  - Objective: To validate a system, using electromagnetic movement sensors, for the simultaneous measurement of scapular and humeral positions. Design: The study was designed to analyse the repeatability and to quantify the inherent measurement errors, using two observers to measure the movements of five normal subjects. Background: Following an earlier study of a system to measure three dimensional scapula motion, the method has been developed to incorporate simultaneous measurement of humeral and scapular position using a new design of scapula locator and a two-channel measurement system. Methods: The system was used to measure the scapula movements accompanying abduction of the shoulder. The scapula locator was applied at 10°intervals of abduction. This was measured initially using a fluid filled goniometer, but, in a second part of the study, using an additional motion sensor. Results: In the single channel study, the 95% confidence intervals were less than 4°and 10 mm. When simultaneous measurement of arm position was performed the confidence intervals were little changed. Conclusions: A new system for the measurement of scapulohumeral relationships has been shown to have good inter-and intra-observer reliability. This study opens the way for a full investigation of the scapula motion accompanying three dimensional shoulder motion in both normal subjects and in patients having shoulder pathology.

N2  - Os acromiale is an uncommon condition of the shoulder. When symptomatic, os acromiale may cause impingement pain, rotator cuff tears, or pain through abnormal motion at the unfused apophysis. Treatment of symptomatic os acromiale is controversial. This article reports on four patients with symptomatic meso-acromions who were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. All four patients recovered full function postoperatively with UCLA shoulder rating scores improving from 19 preoperatively to 35 postoperatively. Open reduction and internal fixation of a symptomatic meso- acromion is a reliable and reproducible technique in which the deltoid attachment and lever arm are minimally affected.

N2  - Objective. The objective of this study is to illustrate the low accuracy of two-dimensional (2-D) X-ray projection methods for the quantification of the three-dimensional (3-D) shoulder motions. Background. The traditional method for the quantification of the gleno-humeral motion is by means of 2-D X-ray recording. The motion was characterized by the scapulo-humeral rhythm: the ratio of the nett humeral elevation over nett scapular rotation. The method was based on the quantification of the planar projection of the spatial positions of X-ray dense structures of the scapula. The deformations introduced by the central projection method, a feature of X-ray projection, cannot be compensated for by calibration: the position of the scapula with respect to the camera setting is unknown, and skeletal landmarks of the scapula cannot uniquely be identified. The transformation from 3-D orientations to 2-D angles will, therefore, be inaccurate. Methods. A 2-D X-ray projection of the scapula during a typical arm abduction was simulated. The 3-D motion was obtained by means of palpation and subsequent digitization of skeletal landmarks of the scapula. The 3-D positions of the recorded landmarks were projected on a plane by a simulation based on the parameters of the X-ray equipment. The scapulo-humeral rhythm was calculated for the different scapular landmarks, and for the orientation of the subject with respect to the projection axis. The results were compared with previous published scapulo-humeral rhythms. Results. The scapulo-humeral rhythm depends both on the choice of the skeletal landmarks, used to quantify the scapular rotations, and on the orientation of the subject in the X-ray setting. The full range of results obtained from earlier published experiments could be obtained from a simulation based on a single 3-D arm abduction. Conclusions. The 2-D scapulo-humeral rhythm, obtained from planar X-ray projection, is an inaccurate parameter to define the scapular motions.

N2  - Objective. To evaluate the reliability and discriminative ability of a test battery consisting of 7 tests designed for the assessment of functional limitations in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Methods. The intrarater reliability of the test battery was evaluated for 15 women with FMS. Interrater reliability was calculated on 4 tests separately. Fifteen healthy women constituted a reference group. Results. The intrarater coefficient of variation was <8% for the shoulder range of motion tests, chair test, and 6-minute walk test, and <21% for the shoulder endurance test, with correlation coefficients above 0.80 for all tests. Kappa was 0.70-0.80 for the hand-to-scapula tests. The-interrater coefficient of variation was <5% for shoulder range of motion. The performances of the FMS patients were significantly decreased in comparison with healthy subjects in all the tests except for the hand-to-scapula movement. Conclusions. All but 1 of the selected 7 tests were considered to possess acceptable intrarater reliability for use in FMS in clinical physical therapy practice.

N2  - Objective. The objective of this study is to verify the assumption that the three-dimensional (3-D) shoulder motions can be described by means of an interpolation of statically recorded postures and thus, support the application of non-invasive but static techniques for motion analysis of the shoulder. Background. During shoulder motions the scapula moves underneath the skin. Recording of motions is only possible by means of invasive methods. An alternative for the recording is palpation of skeletal landmarks on the scapula and subsequent digitization. The method is non-invasive and relatively easy, but static. Motions are modelled by means of interpolation of the subsequent position recordings. Validity of this method, however, has never been demonstrated. Methods. Seven subjects performed an alternating abduction-adduction motion of the arm in a plane 30°forward rotated with respect to the frontal plane, at three sub-maximal frequencies: 0.04, 0.25 and 0.50 Hz. The humeral and scapular motions were recorded by means of a two-dimensional (2-D) X-ray video system. The motions of the humerus, the scapular spine and the glenoid ridge were defined by angles, and the sinusoidal motion curves were characterized by means of the offset, the amplitude and the phase of the motions. Results. By means of Repeated Measurements Multi-Variate Analysis of Variance, a significant effect of arm motion on the phase and the amplitude of the scapular motion was found. However, the magnitude of the effects are negligibly small for the present applications at sub-maximal arm motion velocities. Conclusions. For normal arm motions in the vertical plane, the kinematics of the shoulder skeleton can be derived by the interpolation of statically recorded positions of the bones.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to present our experience and results with arthroscopic resection of the acromioclavicular joint. Material and methods: 115 patients out of 128 patients could be reevaluated with an average follow-up of 2.8 years. The average patient age was 47.8 years. No patient suffered from a complete rotator cuff tear (type C). In 92 cases ARAC was combined with arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD). The average age of this subgroup was 50.2 years. In 23 patients we performed only an ARAC. These patients had an average age of 31.8 years. At follow-up the patients were evaluated by a modified Constant-Score, a Taft-Score as well as with a visual analog scale (VAS). All patients had standardized x-rays for documentation of joint stability as well as for documentation the amount of bone resection. Results: The Taft-score at time of follow up reached 9.8 ± 1.5 points for the total group. In those patients, we had only performed the ARAC the Taft-score reached 10.7 ± 1.8 points. The same tendency could be documented with the Constant-score. While the Constant-score of the entire group was 82.3 ± 12.4, patients after ARAC alone scored 93.5 ± 14.8. The parameters of the Constant-score showed improvement of pain during motion as well as of pain at rest. Power, range of motion as well as bearing weights were not limited prior to surgery and therefore did not show further improvement. Conclusion: Our results showed that ARAC is a standardized and reproducible procedure. Patients with unstable joints, however, should not undergo ARAC alone but rather in combination with a stabilizing procedure.

N2  - Levator scapulae is a 'twisted' muscle with four separate origins from upper cervical vertebrae and two folds at its attachment on the scapula. It is active with every movement of the arm and is frequently in static contraction in order stabilise the scapulae during precision use of the hand. Although its role in shoulder movement has been well researched, its effect on cervical function has seldom been investigated. Describe tests for length and tone seem to test only the more vertical fibres or do not make use of enough cervical rotation to test the more horizontal fibres. The hypothesis is made that the more horizontal fibres have a stronger tendency to become tight. An alternative muscle length test, emphasising C2 contralateral rotation, is describe and substantiated from anatomy and possible biomechanics. 102 subjects were assessed to determine the most effective way to test the length of levator scapula. The test describes by Janda, Travell and Simons were compared with the suggested alternative test. It was found that more subjects tested positive for decreased length in levator scapula in the C2 rotation test than in any of the others. A combination of this test and Janda's length test is suggested as a true assessment of levator scapula dysfunction.

N2  - Shoulder kinematics, including scapular rotation relative to the trunk and humeral rotation relative to the scapula, were examined during humeral elevation in three vertical planes via video analysis of intracortical pins. Helical axis parameters provided an easily interpretable description of shoulder motion not subject to the limitations associated with Cardan/Euler angles. Between 30 and 150°of elevation in each plane, the scapula rotated almost solely about an axis perpendicular to the scapula. Additional scapular rotation appeared to support the notion that the scapula moves 'toward' the plane of elevation. Humeral rotation took place mainly in the plane of the scapula independent of the plane of elevation. Many parameters of shoulder complex kinematics were quite similar across all planes of elevation, suggesting a consistent movement pattern with subtle differences associated with the plane of elevation.

N2  - Background and aims: the transfer from sitting to standing and back to sitting as the two phases of the same task has never been studied in elderly people. The purposes of this study were to analyse and compare kinematic features of the whole task (standing up and sitting down) and to determine whether there are age-related differences upon movement kinematics in healthy elderly persons during the whole sequence (standing up and sitting down). Methods: the movements of various parts of the body were measured with a 100 Hz television image analyser that computed the co-ordinates of small reflective markers glued onto the skin of the subjects. The task was conducted using an armless chair set to 100% of knee height under four conditions: at normal speed in light, at normal speed in the dark, at fast speed in light and at fast speed in the dark. Type of study: laboratory study. Results: in young subjects, the task was characterized by similar acromion trajectories and angular displacement of trunk in standing up and sitting down and by a stabilization of the head in space during the two phases. However, the time required to achieve the movement was found to be greater in sitting down than in standing up, and an adjustment of velocity appeared in final part of the movement before reaching the chair. In sitting down, as in carrying out a pointing task of upper limb, an adjustment was required to achieve accuracy. This feature was not found in standing up. Age-related differences appeared to be more important during sitting down than during standing up. Moreover, deterioration of head stability was found in elderly subjects, particularly when the task was achieved rapidly and in darkness. Conclusion: there is a relationship between changes in the motor control of the task, which appeared during periods of potential postural instability, and the effects of ageing on postural stability.

N2  - Wheelchair athletes are susceptible to injuries related to overuse of the shoulder, in particular shoulder impingement syndrome. The present study examined the relationship of shoulder pain to demographic details, isokinetic strength and muscle balance in 8 elite quadriplegic rugby players. Demographic data were collected using personal interviews and each subject was clinically examined for signs of impingement syndrome by a physician. In addition each subject underwent bilateral isokinetic strength testing of the shoulder at 60 and 180 deg/s for abduction/adduction and internal/external rotation. A series of step-wise multiple discriminant analysis successfully predicted clinical symptoms from demographic, muscular strength and balance data. In particular, there was a significant deficit in adductor strength and this was related to shoulder pain and wasting of the scapular muscles. This strength deficit may be due to the high level of spinal lesions in the quadriplegic population. The level of spinal lesion may contribute to the aetiology of shoulder pathology in quadriplegia, and differentiate it from that observed in able-bodied athletes who exhibit weak abductors.

N2  - Body position and stabilization is a controversial issue for shoulder rotational testing in the scapular plane. The purposes were to determine the effects of body position on the external/internal rotation (ER/IR) ratios and how closely they approximated previously reported ratios. Twenty-two healthy, informed subjects participated in test-retest isokinetic sessions involving two body positions (seated, standing), two rotational joint motions (external, internal), three velocities (60, 120, 180°.s-1) and two contraction types (concentric, eccentric). Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.89-0.93. A three-way ANOVA with repeated measures, used to analyze the data for contraction type separately, showed significant effects (p < 0.000) for body position regardless of body position. Concentrically, significant effects were observed for gender (p < 0.018), velocity (p < 0.000) and body position x velocity x gender (p < 0.003). It was concluded that use of the standing position with adequate stabilization is viable and perhaps more applicable to activities of daily living. Secondly, the 'acceptable' ER/IR ratios (0.6-0.7) previously defined should be extended to 0.5-0.7 to allow for varying joint and body positioning.

N2  - Purpose: Poor scapulohumeral rhythm from faulty shoulder and scapular movements may contribute to pathological conditions. Simple, practical means of quantifying scapular position have been recently described by some authors, and reliability was tested. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of age on the static scapular position and rotation with the Kibler procedure. Methods: 17 young healthy volunteers (mean age = 21 years) and a group of 14 older subjects (mean age = 69 years) were examined by the same tester. The tape measurements consisted of the classic method of Kibler in 3 sitting postures, expanded by the measurement of the linear distance from the medial border to the thoracic midline. These results allowed to calculate a scapular rotator index. The SAS software package was used for data analysis. Results: The distance from inferior angle to thoracic midline was significantly larger in the older population in 0°and 45°abduction. A normalisation of the rotation index occurred in the position of 90°abduction and external rotation. This ratio provides a simple, practical mean of quantifying scapular position in patients with pathological conditions. Conclusion: We conclude that older subjects have a more abducted and less rotated rest position than younger ones, but achieve a rotation index in 90°abduction and internal rotation equal to that of younger subjects. We believe that the Kibler technique holds promises for further research in pathological conditions.

N2  - The shape of the acromion is strongly associated with impingement syndrome and with rotator cuff tears. It is notoriously difficult to image the acromion with conventional radiography. We have developed MRI techniques to depict the acromion in its longitudinal axis. Furthermore, we have measured the subacromial space in both external and internal rotation. In previous studies, three types of acromial shape have been described with the type III or hooked acromion being present in 66% of cases with rotator cuff tears. We studied 31 normal shoulders in 29 people using MRI. Within this population aged 24-36 years, mean age 31 years, no type III acromions were found. Twenty-one were type I (67.7%) and 10 were type II (32.3%). In addition, we found no difference in subacromial height in external or internal rotation. Low rates of intra- and interobserver error were found. These results imply that the hooked acromion is not present in the normal population and is, therefore, likely to be an acquired abnormality.

N2  - The inability to perform the "liftoff" test has been attributed to a subscapularis muscle or tendon injury. The goals of this study were to evaluate the activity of the glenohumeral muscles during performance of the "liftoff" maneuver and to identify the most effective initial upper extremity placement that isolates the subscapularis musculotendinous unit. In the first phase of this study 15 subjects accomplished four proposed versions to the "liftoff" test while their intramuscular electromyographic activity in select glenohumeral muscles was recorded. The second phase of this study assessed the ability of five subjects with a nonfunctional subscapularis musculotendinous unit to perform the same proposed versions. On the basis of electromyographic data none of the proposed versions to the "liftoff" maneuver isolated the upper and lower subscapularis muscle from either the teres major, latissimus dorsi, posterior deltoid, or rhomboid muscles (p > 0.05). In the presence of a nonfunctional subscapularis musculotendinous unit, the subjects were able to perform all of the proposed versions of the "liftoff" maneuver except one: elevation of the dorsum of the hand from the posterior-inferior border of the scapula (maximum internal rotation test). Although significant electromyographic activity was generated in the potentially confounding shoulder girdle muscles during the maximum internal rotation "liftoff" test, a successful test appears to be dependent on the isolated glenohumeral internal rotation function of the subscapularis muscle.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Impingement syndrome is a common cause of shoulder pain. Conservative treatment should always be initially considered. But for those patients with persistent symptoms, open acromioplasty is a reliable method to relieve pain and improve function. METHODS: From May 1989 to September 1994, a series of 36 anterior acromioplasties for impingement syndrome of the shoulder in 34 patients was retrospectively analyzed. Among them, rotator cuff tear was found in 25, and concomitant cuff repair was performed in 20. Five shoulders were not repaired because of a massive tear with marked cuff retraction. Neer's functional criteria and Constant's functional score were used to evaluate the results of anterior acromioplasty. The postoperative evaluation included patient satisfaction, relief of pain, range of motion and full use of the shoulder. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with an average follow-up of 34 months were available for assessment. The average Constant's functional score was 94.7 points in the excellent group (55.5%), 77.2 points in the good group (30.5%) and 58.6 points in the poor group (13.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall there was an 86% satisfactory rate by Neer's criteria. Anterior acromioplasty appears to be an effective procedure for shoulder impingement syndrome.

N2  - A retrospective study of fifty-two patients (48 cases followed up), with Allman-Tossy grade III acromioclavicular separations, who were treated with coracoclavicular reconstruction by Mersilene prosthetic substitute (Mersilene tape with polyester suture, 5 mm wide, 30 cm, Ethicon), was carried out. The average follow up was 38 months, with the longest being 10 years, and the shortest being 8 months. The average age of the patients was 32 years, with a range from 20 to 62 years. Two groups were divided by age. Although the younger age group showed better results than the elder one in pain, range of motion and return to previous occupation or sports, the overall outcome was satisfactory in 41 of 48 (86%) followed patients. For the grade III acromioclavicular separation patients, surgical reconstruction with Mersilene looping provides a reliable result including use of the arm for sports or repetitive work.

N2  - A study was undertaken to investigate the precision of plain radiographs in the assessment of the width of radiolucent lines and to define parameters for more accurate measurement. A metal-backed glenoid component was inserted into fourteen cadaveric scapulae; the component had a radiolucent spacer at the central post to provide a gap with a known width at the component-bone interface. The specimens were mounted in a custom-designed jig, and initial radiographs were made with the glenoid in neutral version; sequential radiographs then were made, at 5-degree intervals, with the glenoid in 0 to 40 degrees of anteversion and retroversion. Four independent observers with various levels of experience measured the width of the radiolucent lines with use of digital microcalipers. Osteometric analysis demonstrated that normal glenoid version ranged from 3 degrees of anteversion to 13 degrees of retroversion; these values were similar to those reported in previous studies. Radiographic analysis showed that accurate measurement of the width of the gap was dependent on the position of the glenoid. The measured widths of the radiolucent lines were significantly smaller than the known width of the gap when retroversion was 10 degrees or more and when anteversion was 15 degrees or more (p ≤ 0.05). Radiolucent lines were not consistently observed on radiographs that were made with the glenoid in more than 20 degrees of anteversion and retroversion. An analysis of interobserver error showed close agreement among the measurements made by the different observers when the glenoid was in 0 and 5 degrees of rotation, with decreased agreement when the glenoid was rotated more than 10 degrees from neutral. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Inaccurate positioning of the patient and anatomical variation in glenoid version may explain the variability in the reported onsets, progressions, and frequencies of radiographic loosening of glenoid components. The findings of the present study also may help to explain the poor association between clinical and radiographic findings reported for patients who have pain at the site of a total shoulder prosthesis. Radiographs made within 10 degrees of neutral should allow accurate assessment of radiolucent lines about the glenoid.

N2  - Current algorithms for lower limb injuries recommend amputation for most Gustilo type III-C injuries with a limb salvage index score of 6-8 or more. Recent improvements in the timing and technique of microvascular flaps with the reduction in bone healing time as a result of better fixation devices and early bone grafting make the option of limb salvage after such severe injuries a valid and acceptable therapeutic approach. We present a case of severe shot gun injury to the leg with a limb salvage index score of 9 that was successfully salvaged by vascular reconstruction followed three days later with a microvascular osteocutaneous scapular flap anastomosed to the divided limbs of a preliminary arteriovenous fistula that had been constructed at the time of the initial vascular repair. The patient was able to walk unaided one year after the injury.

N2  - Contemporary shoulder rehabilitation programs emphasize scapular control in the treatment of shoulder pathology. In addition, scapular winging and scapular tipping are often cited as key components to both the evaluative and rehabilitative phases of treatment. However, the lack of objective measurement procedures makes clinical evaluation of these phenomena difficult. The purpose of this project was to develop a reliable technique to quantify posterior scapular displacement (direction of scapular movement for winging and/or tipping). Forty healthy subjects (21 males, 19 females) who reported no current shoulder pain participated in this study. A measurement instrument was designed to quantify, to the nearest whole degree of motion, the posterior displacement of the inferior angle of the scapula from the posterior thorax. Subjects' scapulae were each measured two times without holding weight (unweighted position) and two times while the subjects held 10% of their body weight (weighted position). During all trials, two testers were blinded from the measurement readings. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated based on a repeated measure analysis of variance to determine intertester and intratester reliability. The standard error of measurement (SEM) was used to determine the measurement error. Intratester within-day reliability ICCs ranged from 0.97 to 0.98, and SEM ranged from 0.6 to 1.1°. Intertester within-day reliability ICCs ranged from 0.92 to 0.97, and SEM ranged between 1.1 and 1.7°. None of the calculated p values for intratester and intertester reliability were statistically significant (p < 0.05). We conclude that this measurement technique is a reliable method to quantify posterior scapular displacement. Further research utilizing this measurement technique is recommended.

N2  - Smooth motion of the scapula and humerus with respect to the thorax is essential for shoulder function and abnormalities may indicate clinical entities. Recent studies have made an attempt to devise simple, practical means of quantifying scapular position. The aim of this study was to examine the intra-tester and inter-tester reliability of two methods and to determine if significant differences existed between the dominant versus non-dominant extremity. Seventeen healthy volunteers (4 M; 13 F) were examined by two testers. The tape measurements consisted of the classic methods of Kibler and DiVeta in three sitting postures, expanded by the measurement of the linear distance from the medial border to the thoracic mid-line, and the scapular size measure. The SAS software package was used for data analysis. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) intra-tester reliability ranged between 0.96-0.8 for both methods without significant differences, whereas the ICC for inter-tester reliability ranged between 0.42-0.9 with higher values (moderate and good) for the Kibler technique. In the additional tests high values were also obtained for ICC intra-tester, except for the measurements of the linear distance of the medial border of the scapula to the thoracic mid-line and the distance of the inferior process of the acromion to the third vertebra, both in 90 degrees abduction and internal rotation. The ICC for inter-tester was only acceptable for the DiVeta measurement on 45 degrees abduction. Significant differences were noted between both testers on the following measures: Kibler in 45 degrees abduction, DiVeta in 45 degrees abduction and 90 degrees abduction and the scapular size measure. The comparison of dominant versus non-dominant extremity revealed larger but not significantly different means for the dominant extremity in the classic methods. Significant differences occurred for Tester 1 in the measurement of the distance of the medial border to the thoracic mid-line and Tester 2 in DiVita in 45 degrees abduction. The SEM values never exceeded 1 cm. We believe that the Kibler technique holds promise for further studies, has the advantage of measuring in three positions and with some familiarisation can be reliable. Further research is necessary in patients with pathological conditions.

N2  - Modelling of the shoulder mechanism is dependent upon reliable data on the morphometry and points of attachment of the relevant muscles. In this paper, the authors present coordinate data which have been derived from the radiography of dissected cadavers. All of the coordinates have been normalised with respect to reference dimensions of the relevant segments (humerus, scapula, clavicle and trunk). Similarly the measurements of physiological cross-section area (PCSA) have been normalised with respect to that of deltoid. The measurements of PCSA have been shown to agree largely with the work of Veeger et al. and Karlsson and Peterson. While the majority of the descriptions of morphometry concur with accepted texts there are some notable disagreements, particularly concerning trapezius.

N2  - Internal rotation of the shoulder is frequently measured by noting the maximal vertebral level reached by the patient's thumb, but it is not at all certain that this maneuver is strictly measuring internal rotation. We analyzed this maneuver with computed tomographic scans of the shoulder in differing positions. We also analyzed extension of the glenohumeral joint and scapulothoracic articulation with scapular lateral radiographs. Finally, we used posteroanterior radiographs to analyze elbow flexion at the limits of internal rotation behind the back. We found that maximal internal rotation behind the back occurs in approximately a 2 : 1 ratio between the glenohumeral joint and the scapulothoracic articulation. However, the scapulothoracic articulation was more significant in placing the arm behind the back, whereas the glenohumeral joint performed most of the internal rotation in front of the body. The scapulothoracic articulation assists in this motion by both extension and internal rotation of the scapula on the thorax. The limits of internal rotation behind the back are reached with a significant contribution from elbow flexion. We conclude that measuring shoulder internal rotation by the maximal vertebral level reached by the patient's thumb greatly oversimplifies the concept of internal rotation and that limitations in this motion may not be strictly due to a loss of internal rotation at the glenohumeral joint.

N2  - A method for directly measuring the position of the humeral head on the face of the glenoid in different positions of abduction of the arm was developed. We studied three subject groups: 12 patients with normal shoulders (group 1), 15 patients with stage II impingement syndrome (group 2), and 20 patients with rotator cuff tears or stage III impingement (group 3). The study consisted of a series of anteroposterior roentgenograms in the plane of the scapula with the arm in neutral rotation. Roentgenograms were obtained at 20 degrees intervals as the arm was elevated in the plane of the scapula from 0 degree to 120 degrees. Patients held a weight equal to 2 1/2% of body weight in the hand. The parameters measured were excursion of the humeral head on the glenoid face, expressed as the distance that the center of the head lies above or below the center of the glenoid, arm angle, scapulothoracic angle, and glenohumeral angle. For patients with normal shoulders (group 1), there was no significant change in position of the humeral head with arm elevation. In contrast, those with stage II impingement (group 2) had significant (p < 0.05) superior displacement of the center of the humeral head with arm elevation. Patients with rotator cuff tears (group 3) demonstrated a significant rise (p < 0.05) during the first 40 degrees of abduction. The average position of the humeral head in the two pathologic patient groups was superior (p < 0.05) to the average head position in the normal patient group. There was no significant difference in head position between patients with stage II impingement and patients with rotator cuff tear. The ratio of the glenohumeral angle to the scapulothoracic angle during abduction was calculated for our patient groups. In both patient groups, arm abduction had a larger scapulothoracic component than for normal shoulders. The superior migration of the humeral head is a probable result of cuff failure, either partial or complete.

N2  - Arthroscopic treatment was performed on 71 patients with recurrent shoulder dislocations; all of the patients had monoplanar anterior instability attributable to arthroscopically diagnosed Bankart lesion. Of the 71 operations, 29 were performed using the original Cuspari technique (follow-up, 59 months), and 42 were performed after modifications made in the original technique (follow-up, 38 months), notably improved preparation of the capsular reinsertion zone and increase in the number of monofilament points and their anchorage directly to the bone, on the spine of the scapula. We compared the results obtained in these two differently treated groups, taking into account several factors in the patient's history and clinical condition. These included the number of dislocation episodes before the operation, as well as clinical findings regarding stability, movement, function and pain (Rowe scale score), contralateral shoulder laxity, level of preoperative versus postoperative athletic activity, and postoperative recurrence rate. In the Caspari-treated group, we obtained 66% satisfactory results compared with the 90% obtained in the second group. The recurrence rate was 27% in the first group compared with 4.8% in the second group. These data were statistically significant. No correlation was found between preoperative number of dislocations and recurrence rate, nor for contralateral shoulder laxity. No significant difference was found regarding resumption of sport activity in the two groups. Our data indicate that, with accuracy in patient selection and effective surgical technique, the recurrence rate can be reduced, and results similar to those of the arthrotomic technique may be obtained.

N2  - A practical and repeatable method for measurement of pulsatile insulin release in the dog was developed by direct, chronic cannulation of the portal vein cephalad to the pancrease and the entry point of the cranial pancreaticoduodenal vein, with subsequent exteriorization of the sampling catheter. Mixed breed male dogs of various body weights and ages underwent midline laparotomy for exposure of the portal vein system. After exposure the portal vein was dissected free and cannulated through a purse-string suture placed just caudad (approximately 1 cm) to the entry point of the cranial pancreaticoduodenal vein with a cuffed, medical grade, silastic catheter. The catheter was advanced cranial to a point just distal to the level of the liver and secured in place via the purse-string suture and a single stay suture. The catheter was then passed through the dorsolateral abdominal wall and routed subcutaneously to a point between the shoulder blades. After catheter plug attachment the catheter was tested for patency, flushed, heparin locked, then was secured to the subcutaneous tissue between the scapulas. The dorsal skin wound and abdominal incision were closed in a routine manner, and the dogs recovered from anesthesia. Catheter patency and function in all dogs were maintained for periods up to 4 weeks. No postoperative complications such as catheter tract infections occurred, maintenance was minimal, and all dogs were afforded complete freedom of movement and activity throughout the study, with no requirement for cumbersome jackets or wraps.

N2  - Normal scapular rest position is neither adequately described nor agreed upon by authorities. The purpose of this study was to devise and describe a reliable and valid test (the Lennie Test) to measure scapular position, including normal scapular rest position. Fifteen healthy females (age 1921 years) participated in the study. Horizontal and vertical scapular position in the frontal plane was quantified by three different investigators using a scoliometer and caliper. Same-day radiographs were used to validate scapular position surface measurements. The medial borders of the scapulae were found to be parallel to the thoracic midline. The scapulae were on average 17.19 ± 1.85 cm apart (at the level of the root of the scapulae) with the dominant arm scapula being on average 0.49 ± 0.74 cm lower than the nondominant scapula. This difference in height between scapulae was not statistically significant (p > .01). Correlation coefficients between skin surface and radiograph measurements of scapular position ranged from .43 to .82. Intertester intraclass correlation coefficients for surface measurements of scapular position ranged from .64 to .86. The Lennie Test was found to have moderate to high intertester reliability and to provide an accurate measurement of the anatomical location of the scapulae based on X-ray verification. Surface landmark measurements for scapular position were on average within 0.56 cm and within 1.7° of the measurements made from X-rays for linear and angular position, respectively. We propose the use of the Lennie Test in populations, healthy or otherwise, where scapular position needs to be objectively measured.

N2  - The purposes of this study were (a) to determine the reliability of the Nicholas hand-held dynamometer for measuring scapular adductor strength and (b) to determine if isokinetic strengthening of the scapular adductors while horizontally abducting the shoulder is more effective than strengthening the scapular adductors while extending the shoulder. An isometric make test was used to determine scapular adductor strength before and after a 6-week training program. Intraclass correlation coefficient indicated high pretest and posttest reliability. The individuals who trained the scapular adductors while horizontally abducting the shoulder showed greater increases in mean force values (20.49 kg pretest to 31.74 kg posttest) than the group combining scapular adduction with shoulder extension (19.61 kg pretest and 25.52 kg posttest). ANOVA showed a significant interaction between group and time. It may be more effective to isokinetically strengthen the scapular adductors with shoulder horizontal abduction rather than shoulder extension as a combined movement.

N2  - Objective: In this prospective study, we established and evaluated an ultrasound technique to demonstrate anterior passive translation of the shoulder, using a new anterior approach. Methods: A preliminary in vitro study was performed, with anterior ultrasound scanning of a skeleton in a waterbath. Forty shoulders in twenty normal subjects were then examined with a 3.5 MHz linear transducer, using the same anterior approach. The anterior range of motion (ROM) was measured during passive anterior translation. Results: Anatomical landmarks were identified anteriorly on the humerus and the scapula, to define a scanning plane, in which ROM was measured to 1.8 ± 0.1 mm (mean ± S.E.M.) (range 0.4-4.1 mm). The difference in ROM between the two shoulders of each subject (Δ ROM) was calculated: 0.7 ± 0.1 mm (range 0.1-1.9 mm). Conclusion: The anterior translation of the shoulder can be assessed objectively, non-invasively and rapidly by ultrasonography. We found ROM to be less than 4 mm, and Δ ROM to be less than 2 mm. The interobserver variability of the method remains to be investigated, as is. its usefulness in the diagnosis of chronic anterior shoulder instability.
U1  - Objective: In this prospective study, we established and evaluated an ultrasound technique to demonstrate anterior passive translation of the shoulder, using a new anterior approach. Methods: A preliminary in vitro study was performed, with anterior ultrasound scanning of a skeleton in a waterbath. Forty shoulders in twenty normal subjects were then examined with a 3.5 MHz linear transducer, using the same anterior approach. The anterior range of motion (ROM) was measured during passive anterior translation. Results: Anatomical landmarks were identified anteriorly on the humerus and the scapula, to define a scanning plane, in which ROM was measured to 1.8 ± 0.1 mm (mean ± S.E.M.) (range 0.4-4.1 mm). The difference in ROM between the two shoulders of each subject (Δ ROM) was calculated: 0.7 ± 0.1 mm (range 0.1-1.9 mm). Conclusion: The anterior translation of the shoulder can be assessed objectively, non-invasively and rapidly by ultrasonography. We found ROM to be less than 4 mm, and Δ ROM to be less than 2 mm. The interobserver variability of the method remains to be investigated, as is its usefulness in the diagnosis of chronic anterior shoulder instability.

N2  - Background. As early as 1981, the scapular crest was reported as a versatile donor site of vascularized bone flap. In our institute, much attention has been paid to applying a compound flap based on the subscapular vascular system for composite mandibular reconstruction. Methods. The combined V figure-shaped scapular osteocutaneous and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap has been used for primary or secondary reconstruction of the mandible, intraoral mucosa and/or external skin following major ablation of the malignant tumors in seven patients. Results. There was one total flap failure. Satisfactory results were obtained in the remaining patients. Conclusions. The V figure-shaped scapular bone flap supplied by the angular branch provides a long rotation arc of vascular pedicle, a long bony segment of more than 14 cm, and a good contour of mental protuberance. The combination of the scapular osteocutaneous flap with latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap allows reliable reconstruction of massive and three- dimensional composite mandibular defects.

N2  - We studied seven patients who had isolated loss of the proximal attachment of the tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii, documented operatively or with magnetic resonance imaging, in order to identify and measure superior translation of the humoral head on the glenoid. Four true anteroposterior radiographs were made of both shoulders, before and after the operation, with 0, 45, 90, and 120 degrees of humeral abduction in the scapular plane. Four patients were managed with arthroscopic acromioplasty with an open biceps tenodesis; one, with open biceps tenodesis alone; and one, with debridement of a ruptured biceps stump; the remaining patient was managed non- operatively. Two to six millimeters of superior translation of the humeral head was noted in each patient in all positions of humeral abduction except 0 degrees. This translation was significant compared with the contralateral (control) shoulder. Kappa statistical analysis showed excellent reproducibility and interobserver reliability of the technique of radiographic measurement. The results of this study support the role of the tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii as a stabilizer of the humeral head in the glenoid during abduction of the shoulder in the scapular plane.

N2  - In this paper the kinematics of arm abduction in the scapular plane of 38 healthy experimental subjects is reported. The ratio of the glenohumoral and the scapulothoracic components of the motion were determined and the influence of the abduction speed and of the external load on it were investigated. The investigation of the effect of abduction speed involved all 38 subjects. Each of them performed one slow and one fast abduction. Statistical analysis showed that there were large differences between individuals, but that for any one individual the abduction process is essentially reproducible. For the one individual there is a strong, linear relationship between glenohumeral and scapulothoracic rotation. The slope of the regression of the glenohumeral component on total arm abduction varied from 0.75 to 0.5 with a sample mean of 0.66. It means that only two-thirds of arm abduction occurs in the glenohumeral joint, the remaining third taking place via scapular rotation. In slowly performed abductions the slope of the regression was significantly greater than in the high-speed movements, but differences were very small. In the investigation of the effect of external load, statistical analysis indicated that the slope of the intraindividual regression is largely independent of the load. The possibility of observer bias was analysed, too. It was found that the standard deviation of the abduction parameters determined by different observers was between 6 and 10% of that between different experimental subjects.

N2  - A measurement technique is presented for recording positions of the bones of the shoulder mechanism, i.e., thorax, clavicula, scapula and humerus, in 3-D space, based on palpating and recording positions of bony landmarks. The palpation technique implies that only static positions can be measured. Accuracy of retrieving bony landmark is checked on-line using rigid body assumptions. The measurement error is calculated afterwards and is comparable with cinegraphic methods. Axial rotation of the clavicula is estimated by minimizing rotations in the acromioclavicular joint. A number of motion definitions is compared by means of interindividual variation and subjective interpretability. Two useful definitions are proposed for describing motions of the shoulder mechanism. Four conditions have been recorded: abduction and anteflexion of the humerus both with and without additional weight in the hand. Abduction and anteflexion result in large differences in scapular and clavicular motions. The effect of additional weight in the hand on the position of the shoulder girdle is negligible.

N2  - Subcoracoid impingement syndrome pain is elicited by some positions of the upper limbs, i.e., adduction and inward rotation, whenever coracohumeral space reduces. Although acquired or congenital malformations of the humeral head and/or coracoid apophysis are the most common causes of painful syndromes, repeated flections and inward rotations of the upper limbs, typical of some sports, such as swimming and tennis, and of some sports, such as swimming and tennis, and of some kinds of work, are predisposing factors. The subcoracoid impingement syndrome exhibits on pathogenomonic signs at clinics and the specificity of diagnostic methods is low, which calls for reliable radiologic assessment of this condition. Fifteen patients with subcoracoid impingement syndrome underwent X-ray, US, CT and MR studies. Plain radiography detected no specific signs of this syndrome, but yielded useful information regarding other painful syndromes of the shoulder, such as anatomical variants of the acromion and degenerative changes. US yield was poor because of the acoustic window of the coracoid apophysis, but supraspinatus tendon changes were demonstrated in 2 cases. CT and MRI proved to be the most reliable and accurate diagnostic methods, the former thanks to its sensitivity to even slight bone changes and to its capabilities in measuring coracohumeral distance and acquiring dynamic scans and the latter because it detects tendon, bursa and rotator cuff changes. To conclude, in our opinion, when the subcoracoid impingement syndrome is clinically suspected, plain X-ray films should be performed first and followed by MR scans.

N2  - Current shoulder rehabilitation programs encourage scapular stabilization components although, to date, no scientific studies have evaluated changes in scapular position following such rehabilitation. Four different measurement methods of scapular position have been reported in the literature. The purpose of this study was to examine the intratester and intertester reliability of these four methods and to also examine if significant differences exist in scapular position between dominant and nondominant extremities. Thirty-two subjects volunteered for this study. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) revealed acceptable intratester reliability (ICC = 0.81-0.95) for all measurement methods. However, while one method also proved to be acceptable (ICC = 0.91-.92) for intertester measurements, the other three methods were unacceptable (ICC = 0.18-0.69). One tester reported significant differences in scapular position of the dominant and nondominant extremities when using the most reliable method. The second tester found no significant differences with either method. Future research is recommended to reexamine reliability of these methods and measure subjects with shoulder pathology.

N2  - Assessment of posture is an integral component of patient evaluation with shoulder overuse injuries. However, the professional literature contains relatively few studies that have assessed the relationship between posture, function, and injury. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship and differences in postural variables within and between subjects with overuse injuries to the shoulder of healthy subjects. Thirty patient subjects and 30 healthy subjects matched for age and gender were recruited. Scapular protraction and rotation, forward head position, midthoracic curvature, and passive humeral elevation in the plane of the scapula were measured randomly in standing. All measurement techniques were standardized and validated. Intrarater and interrater reliability for all clinical measures were established before data collection. Forward head position was significantly greater (p < .001) in the patient group than the healthy group; humeral elevation was significantly greater (p < .001) in the healthy group than in the patient group and in the uninvolved shoulders (p < .01) than the involved shoulders within the patient group. Scapular protraction, rotation, midthoracic curvature, and scapular symmetry were not significantly different between groups. Scapula protraction and rotation were significantly related (p < .05) in the patient group. No other postural variables were related. Conclusions regarding the influence of posture to shoulder injury are inconclusive based on several confounding variables that may have affected the outcome.

N2  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The authors have conducted a study to evaluate the possible efficacy of endoscopic decompression without repair in the treatment of rotator cuff tears. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We report 42 cases of endoscopic acromioplasty realized for full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Mean follow-up was 28.8 months. The principal presenting symptom was pain, with a mean duration of 29 months. Antero-external acromioplasty was realized by endoscopy using motorized drill bits, with sectioning or resecting the acromio-coracoid ligament. Revision consisted of a standard clinical examination, following the protocol of Constant, and a radiologic examination by sub-acromial frontal and scapular profile x-rays as advised by Liotard. RESULTS: The functional results were very good, with 94 per cent of patients satisfied. The mean Constant score was 67.4 (14-100) corresponding on the average to 84 per cent of the score of a healthy shoulder for the same age and sex. The improvement concerned essentially the score of the pain, which increased on the average 7.4 points out of 15 (10.2/15 at revision) and of the activity level (14.8/20 as opposed to 8/20 initially). Less important was the improvement of the active mobility score (from 25.2 to 34/40 at revision). The force was measured according to the Constant scale, with a mean of 8.3 points out of 25. The mean duration of absence from work for the active patients was 2.4 months. Neither infectious nor neurological complications were noted. The radiographic analysis showed a decrease of the acromial edge, significative as compared to the opposite side. On the profile x-ray, we observed 48 per cent flat acromions in contrast to 80 per cent curved types on the opposite side. The only element influencing the pain score was the size of the rupture, but the statistical result was weak. The final Constant score was strongly influenced by by the size of the rupture, the active mobility, the pre-operative active and passive mobility, as well as by the presence of head excentration on pre-operative x-rays. DISCUSSION: Comparison with other series of endoscopic acromioplasty for full-thickness rotator cuff tears has permitted us to confirm the validity of our series. We have especially evaluated this series in comparison to those with surgical repair. The subjective results, as well as those for pain, are equivalent; results on active mobility and force were not as good. We propose, therefore, this technique of low morbidity, in the presence of total ruptures in older and sedentary patients. The antalgic effect of endoscopic acromioplasty allows, in these patients, a functionally satisfying rehabilitation.

N2  - Our purpose was to determine the intratester and intertester reliability of measurements of both scapular and glenohumeral rotation during active arm elevation in the scapular plane with a new device, the scapulohumeral goniometer (SHG). Ten physical therapists, with 1 to 29 years of clinical experience, obtained repeated measurements on 45 subjects who were 27 to 82 years old. All subjects were tested in a uniform standing position with the handheld SHG, which was positioned over the subject's scapula and posterior shoulder according to operationally defined landmarks. For both scapular and glenohumeral rotation, 50% of the time the first and second measurements made on a patient by the same physical therapist differed by 3° or more. Ten percent of the time, these measurements differed by 8° or more. Measurements of active range of movement of scapular and glenohumeral rotation made by the same physical therapist during arm elevation in the scapular plane are clinically unacceptable when obtained with the current techniques for positioning the SHG. Clinical decisions based on results of active scapular and humeral motion in the scapular plane as measured on a patient by the same therapist with an SHG should be made with caution, because of the variability associated with this procedure.

N2  - A finite element musculoskeletal model of the shoulder mechanism consisting of the thorax clavicula, scapula and humerus has been used for analysis of the kinematic and dynamic behavior. The model includes 16 muscles, three joints, three extracapsular ligaments and the motion constraints of the scapulothoracic gliding plane which turns the shoulder girdle into a closed-chain mechanism. Simulations are inverse dynamic. Input variables are the positions of the shoulder girdle and humerus which have been recorded in 10 subjects during unloaded and loaded humeral abduction and anteflexion. Comparisons of muscle force predictions and EMG recordings are hampered by the unknown force-length relationship and the length dependency of EMG amplitude. It is concluded that EMG amplitude cannot be used for validation of complex musculoskeletal models. Muscle function is analyzed with help of a force and moment balance of the three joints. The moment balance includes the contributions of ligaments and the reaction forces at the scapulothoracic gliding plane. The scapulothoracic gliding plane is very important for the motions and the stabilization of the shoulder girdle. The direction and magnitude of joint reaction forces are calculated as well. It is concluded that the model provides good insight into the mechanics of the shoulder mechanism and that it enables an analysis of the function of morphological structures.

N2  - Arthroscopic acromioplasty is an effective technique to treat refractory impingement syndrome of the shoulder; however, it is a technically demanding procedure and failure due to inadequate acromial resection has been reported. The purpose of this study was to describe a more reliable technique of arthroscopic acromioplasty ('arthroscopic impingement test') that allows determination of subacromial space available (SSA) during shoulder flexion after acromioplasty. During a 2-year period, 70 consecutive patients (group I) underwent arthroscopic acromioplasty by a conventional technique and 50 consecutive patients (group II) underwent the modified technique. Both groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, chronicity of symptoms, incidence of workman's compensation cases, side of surgery, and operative findings. In group I, four patients (6%) failed due to inadequate acromioplasty and at time of revision were found to have 0 mm SSA at 120° flexion (contact of cuff on acromion). After revision acromioplasty, SSA at 120° flexion was measured as >3 mm, and impingement symptoms resolved postoperatively. In group II, there were no failures and SSA after initial acromioplasty was found to average 13 mm at 0°, 10 mm at 45°, 8 mm at 90°, and 6 mm at 120° flexion. In four cases, the 'arthroscopic impingement test' determined that there was inadequate SSA at 120° (<3 mm) after initial acromioplasty, and these were revised by further acromioplasty at time of surgery. It was concluded that the 'arthroscopic impingement test' improves reliability of arthroscopic acromioplasty by verifying adequate acromial resection in a position of impingement.

N2  - Shoulder soft tissues echographic evaluation depends on the availability of well established echographic diagnostic criteria, which hasn't been fully accepted until nowadays, as results in that field have been controversial. The main purpose of the present study has been to determine the echographic criteria of the most frequent shoulder periarticular soft tissue pathology. A prospective study has been carried out, comparing the right to the left shoulder of 37 normals in order to determine the normal characteristics and limits of the selected echographic parameters (echogenicity, echostructure, dimensions in terms of width, rhythm of movement and rotator cuff competence ratio). Afterwards, the relative role of these variables in the identification of three different nosological groups determined through suitable gold standard diagnostic methods (36 suprasinatus tears, 20 supraspinatus tendinitis and 22 subacromial bursitis) has been determined. Lastly, the discriminant power of some echographic parameters association was tested, thus suggesting the echographic criteria to be selected. Results support the following criteria: 1) supraspinatus tears: cuff competence ratio less than 1, the difference value between the affected and the sound tendon thickness less than -1,8 mm associated with asymmetries of one of the remaining parameters (echogenicity, echostructure or rhythm); 2) supraspinatus tendinitis: the difference between the affected and the sound tendon thickness bigger than 1 mm associated with asymmetries of one of the remaining parameters (echogenicity, echostructure or rhythm); cuff competence ratio equal or above 1;3) subacromial bursitis: the difference between the affected and the sound bursa thickness bigger than 1 mm associated with asymmetries of one of the following parametres: echogenicity, echostruture or rhythm.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to develop a new arthroscopic approach for traumatic instability that effectively reattaches avulsed capsulolabral tissue to the glenoid articular rim with sutures. This technique does not depend on fixation devices, trans-scapular drilling, or implantation of suture anchors. We attached a three-dimensional position sensor and force and torque transducer to the humerus and scapula of eight normal cadaveric shoulders to measure the normal, surgically unstable (arthroscopic Bankart lesion), and repaired preparations. We assessed eight motion ranges and six laxity tests. Capsulolabral release increased all passive ranges and allowed significant translational increases on posterior drawer and crank testing. After repair, motion was never decreased and there were no differences in laxity relative to normal. Neurovascular structures were never at risk. Our arthroscopic repair provides anatomic reattachment and effective deepening of the glenoid concavity similar to that achieved by open repair. This new method restores joint stability, preserves motion, and can withstand forceful loads. Ongoing clinical trials will substantiate whether the technique is as safe and reliable as shown cadaverically.

N2  - Since 1941, distal clavicle excision has been a reliable technique for alleviating pain caused by acromioclavicular joint arthritis. Disadvantages of the procedure include permanent shoulder weakness, a lengthy recovery time ranging from weeks to months before useful function of the extremity returns, and lack of cosmesis. By modifying the standard portals used to perform arthroscopic subacromial decompression, the authors have successfully excised the distal clavicle of ten consecutive patients. Using this arthroscopic technique, the surgical time averaged approximately one hour 40 minutes, blood loss was negligible, and there were no complications. Operations were performed in an outpatient setting. Five of ten patients missed work only on the day of surgery, and seven of ten patients required no formal physical therapy. All ten patients achieved a good or excellent result on the UCLA Shoulder Scale for short-term follow-up evaluation. Postoperative radiographs documented adequate bone resection in all cases. In experienced hands, arthroscopic distal clavicle excision is an excellent substitute for the 'open' procedure.

N2  - In 65 patients an arthroscopic resection of the AC-joint (ARAC) was performed. The data of 27 male and 24 female patients with a minimum follow-up of 6 months were available for analysis. 2 patients had bilateral procedures. Patients with rotator cuff tears were excluded from this series. The patients were aged between 22 and 69 years (average 48.4 years). The mean interval from the onset of pain to conservative treatment was 4.6 months and the average period of conservative management prior to surgery was 9.8 months. The indication for ARAC was pain which interfered with the patients' activities of daily living, work, or athletic activities and had not responded to conservative therapy for at least 6 months. Patients' data were recorded before and after surgery according to a 100-point score as well as with a visual analogue scale. The patients' mean preoperative score was 67.8 (+/- 14.6). After surgery, a significant improvement to 93.3 (+/- 12.3) was achieved. Comparing the different parameters we found significant differences in pain during shoulder movement, function, and active range of motion. Prior to surgery the other parameters already scored well, so they did not serve as good discriminators for these patients. The mean reaction length of the lateral clavicle was 23.2 mm inferiorly, 15.9 mm in the middle third, and 13.1 mm superiorly. No ectopic bone formation or postoperative spurs were identified in this series. We could not demonstrate regeneration of the resected parts of the lateral clavicle. No major complication was noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

N2  - Our purpose has been to describe an original surgical technique without describing all the problems concerning the posterior instability. The original technique has a double effect: active with the muscular flap and passively mechanic, if necessary, by the bone graft. Five patients have been treated with this technique with a follow-up of one year and a half. 4 females and 1 male with an average age of 32 years 1/2. 2 were recurrent posterior instability, one unintentional and 2 intentional subluxations. 2 were epileptics. In all cases, the disparition of the instability was obtained. Full range of movement and sport were resumed at the former level. On X-rays, the humeral head was centered. By its double mechanism, active with the muscular flap and possibly passive with the bone graft, this technic is reliable to treat the majority of posterior instability. It combines the way of action searched in physiotherapy and capsulomyoplasties to center the humeral head and this one by the bone graft in case of posterior glenoid fracture or dysplasia. It doesn't have the insufficiencies of physiotherapy or capsulomyoplasties in posterior traumatic instabilities, nor from the classical bone graft over the glenoid posterior wall, cause of osteoarthritis and pain.

N2  - The effect of electrode position on the upper trapezius muscle on the myo-electric signal amplitude was investigated with special reference to arm position and estimate of force output. Previously, a depression of the electromyogram (EMG) signal has been reported midway between the seventh cervical vertebrae (C7) and acromion although this electrode position has been recommended. Ten healthy subjects performed maximal shoulder elevations with the arm in vertical, abducted and flexed positions and they performed a dynamic movement test. The myo-electric signal was recorded along the length of the right upper trapezius muscle by a 16-channel bipolar array electrode and was integrated with a 0.2-s time resolution. A region just lateral to the midpoint between C7 and the lateral edge of acromion was found with high and stable amplitudes (% coefficient of variation equalled 5.6). At the midpoint a dip in the amplitude profile appeared which was slightly displaced by arm abduction or flexion probably due to sliding of the skin relative to the muscle. A linear EMG-force relationship was found in the region with high signal amplitudes, whereas the more lateral and the dip region showed highly variable EMG-force relationships. Thus, it was found that when using bipolar surface electrodes with an interelectrode distance of 2 cm a centre position 2 cm lateral to the midpoint between C7 and acromion provided good repeatability and high signal yield.

N2  - Many disorders of the shoulder complex are accompanied by changes in the pattern of scapular motion which is difficult to measure except radiographically. In order to study the three-dimensional motion of the scapula which accompanies arm movements, a technique has been developed using a three-pointed locater which can be applied over three bony landmarks - the acromial angle, the inferior angle, and the root of the scapular spine. The spatial orientation of the locater relative to the trunk was measured using an electromagnetic movement sensor (ISOTRAK) which has been shown to be clinically reliable. Measurements of scapular plane rotations during abduction showed particularly good agreement with published data; variations in measurements of the out-of-plane angles were attributed to difficulties of contacting the acromion reliably when the deltoid muscle was contracted. It is concluded that the system is suitable for clinical use in the study of shoulder pathology.

N2  - We studied the value of dynamic sonography in adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder joint in patients with clinically suspected frozen shoulder. The sonographic criterion of adhesive capsulitis was continuous limitation of the sliding movement of the supraspinatus tendon against the acromion of the scapula. Arthrography was regarded as a gold standard in the diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis against which the sonographic results were compared. Among 23 patients with arthrographically documented adhesive capsulitis, sonographic examination showed limitation of movement of the supraspinatus tendon in 21. This sonographic sign therefore has a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy of 92% for detecting adhesive capsulitis, making dynamic sonography a reliable technique for the diagnosis of this condition.

N2  - The strength of active external rotation and of abduction of the shoulder when the humerus was in the plane of the scapula (30 degrees of horizontal flexion anterior to the coronal plane) was measured isokinetically and isometrically in thirty-nine normal volunteers, who were stratified by age and sex. The angles at which peak torque was produced were similar when tested isokinetically and isometrically; these angles were similar for external rotation (at 60 and 30 degrees of internal rotation) and for abduction (at 30 and 60 degrees of abduction). Isometric peak torque was greater than slow-speed (90 degrees per second) isokinetic peak torque, which in turn was greater than fast-speed (210 degrees per second) isokinetic peak torque. There were highly significant differences in strength, measured isokinetically and isometrically, between younger and older men and between older men and older women. The variability of normal values for torque was similar in each group. Repeat testing demonstrated a high reliability of isokinetic measurements and of isometric measurements at angles within the range of the production of peak torque. Complete testing was performed in four normal volunteers before and after a block of the suprascapular nerve. The supraspinatus and infraspinatus components of the rotator cuff contributed a variable proportion to the total strength of abduction (25 to 50 per cent) and external rotation (50 to 75 per cent) throughout the range of motion. This study demonstrated that both isokinetic and isometric testing in the scapular plane are valid methods for measurement of the strength of external rotation and abduction of the shoulder. The data support standardization of the positions for testing the strength of motions of the shoulder: isometric strength of external rotation should be measured in the scapular plane with the shoulder in 45 degrees of abduction and 45 degrees of internal rotation; isometric strength of abduction, in the scapular plane with the shoulder in 45 degrees of abduction; and isokinetic strength of external rotation and abduction, in the scapular plane at 90 degrees per second.

N2  - Recently, it has been proposed that shoulder subluxation in hemiplegia is accompanied by 1) the appearance of a V-shaped articular configuration occurring between the humeral head and glenoid fossa and 2) the presence of chronic pain. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of these statements. We evaluated 40 hemiplegic subjects over 3 months. Radiographs of the affected and nonaffected shoulders were taken at both a frontal plane (0°) and a 45° incidence. From these patients, subluxed (n = 19) and nonsubluxed (n = 21) groups were formed. Pain was evaluated using the Present Pain Intensity index of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. On these x-ray films, measurements were taken of the V-shaped space, abduction of the arm, and rotation of the scapula. The statistical analysis (analysis of variance for repeated measures) contrasted the results obtained from the nonaffected side with those from the affected side over the 3 months studied. At the 45° angle, which better exposes the articular configuration of the shoulder, the difference in the V angle between the affected and nonaffected shoulders was significant for the subluxed group (p < 0.01), indicating that such a V-shaped space can be identified. The measures taken also indicate that a downward subluxation of the humeral head occurs relative to the scapula without any systematic abduction of the humerus or downward rotation of the scapula. None of the results obtained from the frontal plane x-ray films was significant. Finally, nosignificant relation was found beteen subluxation and shoulder pain.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether shoulder rotational strength was greater in the plane of the scapula or the frontal plane. Isokinetic shoulder rotational strength was evaluated in 20 subjects. Using the Merac (Universal Gym Equipment, Inc., Cedar Rapids, IA), test data was gathered in the right shoulders, in 45° abduction, at a speed of 60 deg/sec, in the plane of the scapula and the frontal plane. Each subject returned within 1 week for retests to establish reliability. The average correlational coefficient across tests was 0.87. The Merac computer system was used to analyze data. Mean and standard deviations for peak torque to body weight were calculated. A paired t-test was used to examine the difference in the means for internal and external rotation between the two positions. The results indicated no significant difference between the two positions for shoulder internal rotational strength values. However, shoulder external rotational strength values in the plane of the scapula were statistically significantly higher than in the frontal plane (P < 0.001). These preliminary results suggest isokinetic strength training and testing may be preferable in the plane of the scapula rather than the frontal plane.

N2  - Field and laboratory studies of arm-swinging in gibbons reveal its singularity even compared to spider monkeys. On the basis of principal components and discriminant analyses of size-corrected forelimb variables, this study confirms their morphological uniqueness and the more generalized nature of the spider monkey forelimb. Long forearms, well-developed scapular spines, and sagittally thicker radial shafts are features associated strictly with gibbon arm-swinging. On the other hand, large humeral heads, projecting medial epicondyles, and axially elongated scapulae, traditionally regarded as arm-swinging traits, are probably more important for climbing.

N2  - Operative treatment for recurrent dislocation of the shoulder usually focus on the subscapularis muscle because it is supposed to contribute to the joint stability. It is of clinical interest to record the EMG from the subscapularis muscle in order to interpret its function. The purpose of the present study was to describe a safe and reliable route to reach the muscle, deeply located between the scapula and the thoracic cage, with fine-wire EMG electrodes. Twenty-four shoulders were investigated in 12 volunteers. A hypodermic needle containing bipolar fine-wire electrodes was inserted in the posterior axillary line with the subjects in the supine position, and the arm held in an abducted and externally rotated position. Three criteria confirmed the location of the electrodes: experience of periosteal pain when the needle reached the costal surface of the scapula, drawing-in of the wires 3-4 cm when the subject adducted his arm, thereby rotating his scapula downward, and raw EMG recorded, during typical movements. Additionally, in four shoulders, the electrode location was checked with computed tomography. There were no complications from this technique, and the subjects felt no pain from the fine-wire electrodes during arm movements. We conclude that the described technique is a safe and reliable method of reaching the subscapularis muscle with EMG electrodes.

N2  - Posture of the head, neck, and shoulders has long been recognized as a factor contributing to the onset and perpetuation of cervical pain dysfunction syndromes. Treatment regimens frequently include exercise and instruction for postural correction. Clinical assessment of posture, however, tends to be subjective in nature. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of a new objective technique of posture measurement and to establish normal standards for the technique. This study used a computer-assisted slide digitizing system called Postural Analysis Digitizing System (PADS) to determine characteristic values for head and shoulder girdle posture and characteristic range of motion for head protraction-retraction and shoulder protraction-retraction in a sample of able-bodied young men. PADS is a modification of a two-dimensional slide digitizing system developed for measuring trunk range of motion. Twenty male subjects were photographed in a neutral position, the maximally protracted position, and the maximally retracted position of the heads and scapula. Ten subjects were evaluated once, and ten were evaluated twice. The slide photographs were analyzed using a computer-assisted digitizing system. Well-defined anatomic land-marks were used to determine angular relationships in the head, neck, and shoulders. The reliability of the system was tested by calculating an intraclass correlation coefficient, student t-test, and the percent error for each position. The position were considered reproducible, and reliability of the system was considered adequate for postural analysis. Mean values for the positions were 28.48°, 51.97°, and 62.09° for head protraction, the neutral position, and head retraction, respectively. Shoulder position measurements were 131.08°, 98.53°, and 67.49° for protraction, the neutral position, and retraction, respectively. The average range of motion was 33.62° from the protracted head position to the retracted head position, and 63.58° from the protracted should position to the retracted shoulder position.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to develop a simple and reproducible model of scoliosis in the rat without producing direct trauma to the spine, in order to both provide a system for the study of human scoliosis and to ultimately study the conditions under which distraction-induced trauma might occur. Right lateral curvatures were produced in three groups of rats (N=36, 59, 25) at 18-21 days of age by suturing the inferior angle of the scapula to the ipsilateral bony pelvis. In the first group of animals, it was found that a minimum period of 6 weeks of tethering was required in order to produce permanent structural curvatures after release of the tethering sutures. In the second group of rats, a number of morphologic and histologic changes characteristic of human scoliosis were noted, including apical wedging, deviation of the apical spinous process, pelvic asymmetry, rib hump deformity, vertebral rotation, displacement of the nucleus pulposus, disorganized columnization of disc cartilage cells, and an increased number of Type I muscle fibers in paravertebral muscle on the convex side of the curve. Finally, in the third group of rats, a mild spasticity was seen in the ipsilateral hindlimb in approximately one-third of the animals with curvatures greater than 40°. This spasticity was not associated with a change of latency or amplitude of the somatosensory-evoked potential (SSEP). Each curvature group displayed SSEP characteristics that were not statistically different from unoperated control animals. These results indicate the validity of this model system for the study of scoliosis, and, in particular, its usefulness for the study of operative-induced trauma. The production of the scoliotic curvature in these animals does not involve a direct trauma or a change in the SSEP. The model also displays many of the secondary characteristics of human scoliosis. Finally, the model is technically easy to produce and allows for the generation of a wide range of lateral curvatures in a large number of animals in a relatively short period of time.

N2  - In 14 adult patients with brachial plexus injuries, shoulder arthrodesis was completed in a position of 30° abduction, 30° flexion, and 30° internal rotation. Abduction was measured by the position of the arm in relation to the side of the body with the scapula in the anatomic position. Internal fixation was used in each case. Six patients had had Steindler procedures. Three patients with complete paralysis were treated by above-elbow amputation. All shoulders fused. Mean follow-up time was 32 months. All patients noted that shoulder fusion had improved the function of their extremities. Minimum shoulder motion was 60° abduction and 50° flexion. Three procedures failed because of continued pain that was not relieved by surgery. One patient with an elbow flexion contracture disliked the combination of shoulder and elbow flexion. Seven patients required plate removal. Only one of the three patients who had had above-elbow amputation became a good prosthetic user. Shoulder arthrodesis is a reliable procedure that improves function in adult patients with brachial plexus palsy.

N2  - One hundred and twenty-two acromioclavicular separations treated surgically at the Campbell Clinic from 1956 to 1976 have been studied. One group of 44 patients who had primary excision of the distal clavicle with repair of ligaments was compared with another group of 78 patients who had primary repair of the ligaments only. Of the original 122 patients (average age, 27 years; range, 12 to 64 years), 112 were male and 10 were female. Eighty-six of the 122 patients were reevaluated (average follow-up, 4.4 years; range, 1 to 16 years). No difference in the two groups was apparent in range of motion or in muscle power/weakness, as tested by resistive examination. There was no correlation between presence or amount of degenerative changes in the acromioclavicular joint and the patient's symptomatology. Of the group who had excision of the distal end of the clavicle, only 4.5% had degenerative joint disease as compared with 24.3% of the other group. Repair of the coracoclavicular and acromioclavicular ligaments, with a beveled excision of the distal 1 cm of clavicle, has been a successful and reliable method for treating Type III (complete disruption of acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments and tears of deltoid and trapezius muscle attachments from the clavicle) and some Type II (complete disruption of capsule and acromioclavicular ligaments) injuries.
