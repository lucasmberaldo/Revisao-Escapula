TI  - Alterations in shoulder kinematics and associated muscle activity in people with 
      symptoms of shoulder impingement.
PG  - 276-91
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment of patients with impingement symptoms commonly 
      includes exercises intended to restore "normal" movement patterns. Evidence that 
      indicates the existence of abnormal patterns in people with shoulder pain is 
      limited. The purpose of this investigation was to analyze glenohumeral and 
      scapulothoracic kinematics and associated scapulothoracic muscle activity in a 
      group of subjects with symptoms of shoulder impingement relative to a group of 
      subjects without symptoms of shoulder impingement matched for occupational 
      exposure to overhead work. SUBJECTS: Fifty-two subjects were recruited from a 
      population of construction workers with routine exposure to overhead work. 
      METHODS: Surface electromyographic data were collected from the upper and lower 
      parts of the trapezius muscle and from the serratus anterior muscle. 
      Electromagnetic sensors simultaneously tracked 3-dimensional motion of the trunk, 
      scapula, and humerus during humeral elevation in the scapular plane in 3 handheld 
      load conditions: (1) no load, (2) 2. 3-kg load, and (3) 4.6-kg load. An analysis 
      of variance model was used to test for group and load effects for 3 phases of 
      motion (31(-60(, 61(-90(, and 91(-120(). RESULTS: Relative to the group without 
      impingement, the group with impingement showed decreased scapular upward rotation 
      at the end of the first of the 3 phases of interest, increased anterior tipping 
      at the end of the third phase of interest, and increased scapular medial rotation 
      under the load conditions. At the same time, upper and lower trapezius muscle 
      electromyographic activity increased in the group with impingement as compared 
      with the group without impingement in the final 2 phases, although the upper 
      trapezius muscle changes were apparent only during the 4.6-kg load condition. The 
      serratus anterior muscle demonstrated decreased activity in the group with 
      impingement across all loads and phases. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: Scapular 
      tipping (rotation about a medial to lateral axis) and serratus anterior muscle 
      function are important to consider in the rehabilitation of patients with 
      symptoms of shoulder impingement related to occupational exposure to overhead 
      work. [Ludewig PM, Cook TM. Alterations in shoulder kinematics and associated
