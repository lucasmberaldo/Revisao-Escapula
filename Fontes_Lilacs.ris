AB  - Proper placement of suture anchors is an important step in Bankart repair as improper placement can lead to failure. Concern surrounding suture anchor placement inspired the use navigation systems in shoulder arthroscopy. We aimed to demonstrate the technological advantage of using the O-arm (Medtronic Navigation, Denver, CO, USA) image guidance system to provide real-time images during portal and anchor placements in shoulder arthroscopy. Consecutive patients (from July to October 2014) who were admitted for arthroscopic capsulolabral repair surgeries were included. Ten patients were randomly enrolled in the navigation group and 10 in the traditional group. The glenoid was divided into four zones, and the penetration rates in each zone were compared between the two groups. In zone III, the most inferior region of the glenoid, the penetration rate was 40.9% in the traditional group and 15.7% in the navigation group (P = 0.077), demonstrating a trend toward improved accuracy of anchor placement with the aid of the navigation system; however, this was not statistically significant. Average surgical time in the navigation and traditional groups was 177.6±40.2 and 117.7±17.6 mins, respectively. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Scores showed no difference before and 6 months after surgery. This pilot study showed a trend toward decreased penetration rate in O-arm-navigated capsulolabral repair surgeries and decreased risks of implant misplacement; however, possibly due to the small sample size, the difference was not statistically significant. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm the possible benefit of the navigation system. Even with the use of navigation systems, there were still some penetrations in zone III of the glenoid. This penetration may be attributed to the micro-motion of the acromioclavicular joint. Although the navigation group showed a significant increase in surgical time, with improvements in instrument design, O-arm-navigated arthroscopy will gain popularity in clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scapular stabilization exercises (SSE) are often included in the treatment of individuals with rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (RCRSP) to decrease pain and improve function. These SSE typically aim to strengthen the scapular muscles and optimize dynamic neuromuscular control of the scapula, which may improve overall shoulder stability and movement quality. No consensus of the recommended SSE for the management of RCRSP is available. Hence, this study aimed to consult physiotherapists to co-create an inventory of recommended SSE based on the exercise's relevance and frequency of prescriptions for the rehabilitation of individuals with RCRSP. METHODS: A group of 16 physiotherapists with experience in treating shoulder pain participated in a sequential consultation incorporating two distinct rounds of consultation focusing on SSE (modified Delphi design). In round 1, physiotherapists identified and demonstrated up to 10 SSE that they commonly recommend or use among individuals with RCRSP. The description and performance of all SSE were audio and video recorded. All SSE suggested by more than one participant in round 1 advanced to round 2. In round 2, physiotherapists rated these SSE on a 4-point Likert scale according to their perceived relevance and frequency of prescription for this population. RESULTS: In round 1, out of the 25 SSE recommended by participants, 19 SSE (76.0%) were recommended by more than one physiotherapist and advanced to round 2. In round 2, 13 SSE were consensually classified (agreement &#8805;75%) as being relevant for the rehabilitation of individuals with RCRSP. SSE targeting the recruitment of the serratus anterior and lower trapezius muscles were considered the most relevant for the management of RCRSP, whereas SSE targeting neuromuscular scapular control were the most prescribed SSE for the management of RCRSP. CONCLUSIONS: An inventory composed of 13 SSE was co-created by physiotherapists based on their relevance and frequency of prescription for the rehabilitation of individuals with RCRSP. When designing an exercise program, physiotherapists can use this SSE inventory to inform their exercise selection, in combination with their current knowledge on shoulder rehabilitation, as well as patients' preferences.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An accurate estimation of the glenohumeral joint center of rotation (CoR) is important during alignment of braces and exoskeletons, as a misalignment will introduce undesired forces on the human body. The aim of this research was to develop a new method to estimate the glenohumeral CoR and register the location to the body using a single camera and two printed markers. METHODS: During shoulder anteflexion, the arm roughly describes an arc in the sagittal plane, with the glenohumeral joint in the center. Two binary square-fiducial ArUco markers were secured to the upper arm and the scapula, their position and orientation were obtained, and a sphere was fitted to the coordinates of the arm marker. The sphere center position was then registered on the skin. The accuracy was assessed with a test bench with a known rotational center. The repeatability was assessed in vivo with five healthy participants. RESULTS: The mean absolute offset between the true CoR of the test bench and the fitted sphere centers across multiple trials was 2.7 mm at a velocity of 30 degrees/s, and 2.5 mm at 60 degrees/s. The root mean squared distance from the estimated sphere centers after each trial to the mean sphere center across all trials per participant was 5.1 mm on average for the novice examiner and 5.2 mm for the expert examiner. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is able to accurately and precisely estimate the glenohumeral CoR.

AB  - Accuracy of shoulder kinematics predicted by multi-body kinematics optimisation depend on the joint models used. This study assesses the influence of four different subject-specific gleno-humeral joint models within multi-body kinematics optimisation: a 6-degree-of-freedom joint (i.e. single-body kinematics optimisation), a sphere-on-sphere joint (with two spheres of different radii) and a spherical joint with or without penalised translation. To drive these models, the 3D coordinates of 12 skin markers of 6 subjects performing static arm abduction poses up to 180° were used. The reference data was obtained using biplane X-rays from which 3D bone reconstructions were generated: scapula and humerus were 3D reconstructed by fitting a template model made of geometrical primitives on the two bones' X-rays. Without any motion capture system, the recording of the skin markers was performed at the very same time than the X-rays with radiopaque markers. The gleno-humeral displacements and angles, and scapula-thoracic angles were computed. The gleno-humeral sphere-on-sphere joint provided slightly better results than the spherical joint with or without penalised translation, but considerably better gleno-humeral displacements than the 6-DoF joint. Considering that it can easily be personalised from medical images, this sphere-on-sphere model seems promising for shoulder multi-body kinematics optimisation.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Observational, descriptive design. BACKGROUND: Despite scapular mobility being essential for the completion of activities of daily living (ADLs), there is currently no established, a reliable goniometric technique to measure scapular protraction and retraction. A proposed method has shown clinically significant inter-rater reliability for a goniometric technique for these measurements. PURPOSE: This observational descriptive study examined the intra-rater reliability of a goniometric technique to assess scapular protraction and retraction among a sample of healthy adults. METHODS: An occupational therapist who is a certified hand therapist (CHT) and an occupational therapy student used goniometry to measure the neutral (resting), protracted, and retracted positions of the right and left scapula for a sample of healthy young adults (n = 54; a total of 108 data points for each measurement). These measurements were compared to analyze intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. RESULTS: For measurements of the scapula in neutral, protraction, and retraction, the standard error of measure (SEM) for repeat measures by the expert and novice raters was < 4.5° and < 3.9° respectively and ICC values ranged from poor to moderate (0.37-0.63). The SEM for measures between evaluators was < 5.0° and the ICC was poor (0.16-0.35). Minimum detectable change (MDC) values as a percentage of the mean (% MDC) ranged between 15.9 and 43.7% for intra-rater reliability and 21.9-52.8% for inter-rater reliability. DISCUSSION: The results of the study were mixed; variance of less than 5° for repeat measures by the same rater and measures between raters suggest clinically acceptable reliability. However, variance as a proportion of available motion (%MDC) demonstrates a broader range both above and below the threshold of 30% suggested for rehabilitation assessments. CONCLUSION: There are few efficient, reliable techniques to measure scapular mobility in clinical practice. The absolute reliability of goniometry to measure scapular protraction and retraction is similar to measurements of other joints. However, additional research and possible refinement of the technique is recommended to further address relative reliability and validity.

AB  - Working towards the development of robust motion recognition systems for assistive technology control, the widespread approach has been to use a plethora of, often times, multi-modal sensors. In this paper, we develop single-sensor motion recognition systems. Utilising the peripheral nature of surface electromyography (sEMG) data acquisition, we optimise the information extracted from sEMG sensors. This allows the reduction in sEMG sensors or provision of contingencies in a system with redundancies. In particular, we process the sEMG readings captured at the trapezius descendens and platysma muscles. We demonstrate that sEMG readings captured at one muscle contain distinct information on movements or contractions of other agonists. We used the trapezius and platysma muscle sEMG data captured in able-bodied participants and participants with tetraplegia to classify shoulder movements and platysma contractions using white-box supervised learning algorithms. Using the trapezius sensor, shoulder raise is classified with an accuracy of 99%. Implementing subject-specific multi-class classification, shoulder raise, shoulder forward and shoulder backward are classified with a 94% accuracy amongst object raise and shoulder raise-and-hold data in able bodied adults. A three-way classification of the platysma sensor data captured with participants with tetraplegia achieves a 95% accuracy on platysma contraction and shoulder raise detection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of the long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) in glenohumeral stability is not fully understood. Most objects are lifted in the sagittal plane with forward flexion, which stresses the posterior aspect of the unconstrained glenohumeral joint. Determining the mechanism by which the shoulder maintains stability with functional motions is important to understanding the pathoanatomy of degenerative shoulders. Our hypothesis was that the LHBT resists posterior translation of the humeral head (HH) during forward flexion by tensioning the posterior capsuloligamentous complex. METHODS: Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were tested using an established shoulder simulator which loads the LHBT, rotator cuff and deltoid tendons through a system of pulleys. A motion tracking system recorded glenohumeral translations with an accuracy of ±0.2mm. In each subject, the scapula was fixed and the humerus was tested in 6 positions: 30 and 60 degrees of glenohumeral forward flexion at i) maximum internal rotation (IR), ii) neutral rotation and iii) maximum external rotation (ER). The deltoid was loaded with 100N, and the infraspinatus and subscapularis were loaded with 22N each. The difference in glenohumeral translation was calculated at each position comparing the LHBT loaded with 45N or unloaded. RESULTS: At 30 degrees of glenohumeral forward flexion, unloading the LHBT increased humeral head (HH) posterior translation by 2.5mm (±0.9mm) (p<0.001), 1.7mm (±1.0mm) (p<0.001) and 1.0mm (±0.9mm) (p=0.01) at maximum ER, neutral rotation and maximum IR, respectively. At 60 degrees of glenohumeral forward flexion, unloading the LHBT increased HH posterior translation by 2.8mm (±1.2mm) (p<0.001), 2.4mm (±1.6mm) (p<0.001) and 1.7mm (±1.4mm) (p<0.001) at maximum ER, neutral rotation and maximum IR, respectively. CONCLUSION: LHBT loading resists posterior translation of the humeral head during forward flexion. This data supports the role of the LHBT as a posterior stabilizer of the shoulder, specifically when a person is carrying objects in front of them. Further work is needed to determine if unloading the LHBT, as is done with biceps tenotomy or tenodesis, may eventually lead to posterior labral pathology, or to the posterior glenoid wear commonly seen with osteoarthritis.

AB  - Multiple biomechanical shoulder simulators have been described in the literature, with a trend toward increasing complexity to better simulate clinical scenarios. Our objective was to develop an advanced, novel shoulder joint simulator and compare outcomes at two separate institutions, for a typical shoulder joint motion simulation. Identical shoulder simulators were developed & deployed at both institutions. Eight cadaveric upper extremities were tested by simulating actively controlled, arm elevation in the plane of the scapula for two sequential test conditions (intact and nondestructive simulated cuff-tear), each repeated for a total of five trials. Muscle forces and joint translations were recorded for both conditions. The intact condition was repeated following simulated cuff-tear to assess effect of testing order. Statistical analyses were aimed at assessing repeatability and reproducibility of results within specimens, between specimens, and between institutions. The highest average forces were observed for the middle deltoid (233N or 32.5% body weight (BW)), followed by infraspinatus (99.0N), and posterior deltoid (93.7N) muscles. Differentiation between test conditions was unhindered by variability between repeated trials. Data from testing repeated over time, and between the two institutions were not significantly different. The novel shoulder simulator produced repeatable results with low trial-to-trial variation and outcomes were comparable between the two institutions. The results demonstrated a consistent response in muscle forces and humeral translation for the simulated rotator cuff tear condition. Such advanced shoulder simulators could thus be used for evaluating and optimizing surgical interventions and implant strategies.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Scapular protraction and retraction are often essential for occupational performance; however, clinical assessment of these movements is uniquely challenging. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the interrater reliability of a novel goniometric method to measure scapular protraction and retraction. DESIGN: An observational, descriptive design was implemented to evaluate interrater reliability between two experienced occupational therapists who were also certified hand therapists. SETTING: Academic institution. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of graduate students (N = 80). Outcomes and Measures: The hypothesis, developed before study implementation, was that the technique would demonstrate clinically acceptable interrater reliability, defined as a standard error of measurement (SEM) <8°. Goniometric measurements of the scapula at rest, in maximal protraction, and in maximal retraction were independently obtained from each participant by each evaluator. The goniometer was aligned on the scapula using the superior angle as the axis of motion to measure the movement of the acromion relative to the frontal plane. The SEM was calculated in each position using the intraclass correlation coefficient values and the average of the standard deviations from the two raters. RESULTS: The SEM values between the two evaluators for the resting, protracted, and retracted positions were 3.46°, 2.93°, and 2.74°, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The SEM between the two evaluators for each scapular position was <4°, suggesting that the technique may be clinically reliable. However, additional research regarding the reliability and validity of the technique is recommended. What This Article Adds: The findings of this study support the use of goniometry to measure scapular protraction and retraction in relation to occupational performance. The technique provides a way to quantify baseline scapular mobility and track progress.

AB  - In vitro simulation of 3D shoulder motion using in vivo kinematics obtained from human subjects allows investigation of clinical conditions in the context of physiologically relevant biomechanics. Herein we present a framework for laboratory simulation of subject-specific kinematics that combines individual 3D scapular and humeral control in cadavers. The objectives were to: 1) robotically simulate 7 healthy subject-specific 3D scapulothoracic and glenohumeral kinematic trajectories in 6 cadavers, 2) characterize system performance using kinematic orientation accuracy and repeatability, and muscle force repeatability metrics and 3) analyze effects of input kinematics and cadaver specimen variability. Using an industrial robot to orient the scapula range of motion (ROM), errors with repeatability of ±0.1 mm and <0.5° were achieved. Using a custom robot and a trajectory prediction algorithm to orient the humerus relative to the scapula, orientation accuracy for glenohumeral elevation, plane of elevation, and axial rotation of <3° mean absolute error was achieved. Kinematic accuracy was not affected by varying input kinematics or cadaver specimens. Muscle forces over 5 repeated setups showed variability typically <33% relative to the overall simulations. Varying cadaver specimens and subject-specific human motions showed effects on muscle forces, illustrating that the system was capable of differentiating changes in forces due to input conditions. The anterior and middle deltoid, specifically, showed notable variations in patterns across the ROM that were affected by subject-specific motion. This machine provides a platform...(truncated to fit word count, missing text in main PDF includes R2 changes).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Component selection and placement in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) is still being debated. Recently, scapulothoracic orientation and posture have emerged as relevant factors when planning an RTSA. However, the degree to which those parameters may influence ROM and whether modifiable elements of implant configuration may be helpful in improving ROM among patients with different postures have not been thoroughly studied, and modeling them may be instructive. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Using a dedicated expansion of a conventional preoperative planning software, we asked: (1) How is patient posture likely to influence simulated ROM after virtual RTSA implantation? (2) Do changes in implant configuration, such as humeral component inclination and retrotorsion, or glenoid component size and centricity improve the simulated ROM after virtual RTSA implantation in patients with different posture types? METHODS: In a computer laboratory study, available whole-torso CT scans of 30 patients (20 males and 10 females with a mean age of 65 ± 17 years) were analyzed to determine the posture type (Type A, upright posture, retracted scapulae; Type B, intermediate; Type C, kyphotic posture with protracted scapulae) based on the measured scapula internal rotation as previously described. The measurement of scapular internal rotation, which defines these posture types, was found to have a high intraclass correlation coefficient (0.87) in a previous study, suggesting reliability of the employed classification. Three shoulder surgeons each independently virtually implanted a short, curved, metaphyseal impaction stem RTSA in each patient using three-dimensional (3D) preoperative surgical planning software. Modifications based on the original component positioning were automatically generated, including different humeral component retrotorsion (0°, 20°, and 40° of anatomic and scapular internal rotation) and neck-shaft angle (135°, 145°, and 155°) as well as glenoid component configuration (36-mm concentric, 36-mm eccentric, and 42-mm concentric), resulting in 3720 different RTSA configurations. For each configuration, the maximum potential ROM in different planes was determined by the software, and the effect of different posture types was analyzed by comparing subgroups. RESULTS: Irrespective of the RTSA implant configuration, the posture types had a strong effect on the calculated ROM in all planes of motion, except for flexion. In particular, simulated ROM in patients with Type C compared with Type A posture demonstrated inferior adduction (median 5° [interquartile range -7° to 20°] versus 15° [IQR 7° to 22°]; p < 0.01), abduction (63° [IQR 48° to 78°] versus 72° [IQR 63° to 82°]; p < 0.01), extension (4° [IQR -8° to 12°] versus 19° [IQR 8° to 27°]; p < 0.01), and external rotation (7° [IQR -5° to 22°] versus 28° [IQR 13° to 39°]; p < 0.01). Lower retrotorsion and a higher neck-shaft angle of the humeral component as well as a small concentric glenosphere resulted in worse overall ROM in patients with Type C posture, with severe restriction of motion in adduction, extension, and external rotation to below 0°. CONCLUSION: Different posture types affect the ROM after simulated RTSA implantation, regardless of implant configuration. An individualized choice of component configuration based on scapulothoracic orientation seems to attenuate the negative effects of posture Type B and C. Future studies on ROM after RTSA should consider patient posture and scapulothoracic orientation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In patients with Type C posture, higher retrotorsion, a lower neck-shaft angle, and a larger or inferior eccentric glenosphere seem to be advantageous.

AB  - Glenoid component loosening remains a common complication following anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA); however, plain radiographs are unable to accurately detect early implant migration. The purpose of this study was to validate the accuracy of a method of postoperative, three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) imaging with metal artifact reduction (MAR) to detect glenoid component migration following anatomic TSA. Tantalum bead markers were inserted into polyethylene glenoid components for implant detection on 3D CT. In-vitro validation was performed using a glenoid component placed into a scapula sawbone and incrementally translated and rotated, with MAR 3D CT acquired at each test position. Accuracy was evaluated by root mean square error (RMSE). In-vivo validation was performed on six patients who underwent anatomic TSA, with two postoperative CT scans acquired in each patient and marker-based radiostereometric analysis (RSA) performed on the same days. Glenoid component migration was calculated relative to a scapular coordinate system for both MAR 3D CT and RSA. Accuracy was evaluated by RMSE and paired Student's t-tests. The largest RMSE on in-vitro testing was 0.24 mm in translation and 0.11° in rotation, and on in-vivo testing was 0.47 mm in translation and 1.04° in rotation. There were no significant differences between MAR 3D CT and RSA measurement methods. MAR 3D CT imaging is capable of quantifying glenoid component migration with a high level of accuracy. MAR 3D CT imaging is advantageous over RSA because it is readily available clinically and can also be used to evaluate the implant-bone interface.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Restricted shoulder fascia displacement may be an etiological factor for myofascial pain syndrome. A diagnostic ultrasound video can follow deep fascia displacement during active cervical movements. Trackers can be applied to videos to convert deep fascia displacement into data points. This study reports on assessors' reliability in evaluating direction and quantifying upper trapezius' deep fascia displacement during active cervical movements. METHODS: PT-Sonographer 1 recorded deep fascia displacement of upper trapezius for three sets using HS1 Konica Minolta diagnostic ultrasound. The recording sequence used was cervical flexion, extension, right lateral flexion, left lateral flexion, right rotation, and left rotation. The three assessors used the tracker to determine direction of deep fascia displacement. PT-Sonographer 1 used the tracker three times in quantifying deep fascia displacement. Intraclass correlation coefficient and Kappa determined the assessors' intra-tester and inter-tester reliability. RESULTS: Ten participants were included in the study with a mean±(SD) age of 37±(6). All the assessors had acceptable intra-tester reliability in determining deep fascia displacement on tracker (ICC&#8805;0.40). All assessors had clinically unacceptable inter-tester reliability in determining deep fascia displacement when tracking right rotation (ICC < 0.40). PT-Sonographer 1 had clinically unacceptable intra-tester reliability in determining deep fascia displacement when tracking left rotation (ICC<0.40). CONCLUSION: We report clinically acceptable assessors' reliability in determining direction and total deep fascia displacement when tracking diagnostic ultrasound videos of cervical flexion, extension, and lateral flexion. Checking for reliable deep fascia displacements may distinguish MPS from non-MPS individuals increasing the utility of diagnostic ultrasound machine and tracker in clinical practice.

AB  - AIM: To demonstrate how reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) planning software could be used to improve how the trainees position glenoid and humeral implants and obtain optimal simulated range of motion (ROM). METHODS: We selected four groups of five various level participants: medical student (MS), junior resident (JR), senior resident (SR), and shoulder expert (SE). Thereafter, the 20 participants planned five cases of arthritic shoulders for a RSA on a validated planning software following three phases: (1) no guidelines and no ROM feedback, (2) guidelines but no ROM feedback, and (3) guidelines and ROM feedback. We evaluated the final simulated impingement-free ROM, the choice of the implant (baseplate size, graft, glenosphere), and the glenoid implant positioning. RESULTS: MS planning were significantly improved by the ROM feedback only. JR took the best advantage of both guidelines and ROM in final results. SR planning were less performant than SE into phase 1 regarding flexion, external rotation, and adduction (respectively - 10°, p = 0.03; - 11°, p = 0.003; and - 3°, p = 0,03), but reached similar results into phase 3 (respectively - 2°, p = 0.329; - 4°, p = 0.44; - 2°, p = 0.319). For MS, JR, and SR, we observed a systematic improvement in the agreement over the study course. The glenoid diameter remained highly variable even for SE. Comparing glenoid implant position to SE, the distance error decreased with advancing phases. CONCLUSION: Planning software can be used as a simulation training tool to improve implant positioning in shoulder arthroplasty procedures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scapular notching is a radiographic finding associated with the use of a reverse shoulder prosthesis. The morphological characteristics of the glenoid neck have been scarcely explored as a relevant factor in relation to scapular notching. The objective of this study is to measure the length of the glenoid neck in a three-dimensional CT reconstruction of a healthy population and to simulate the scapular notching free range of motion for the "long neck" and for the "short neck" groups. METHODS: CT scans of 214 shoulders were reviewed, excluding incomplete, poor quality, or altered studies. 100 CT scans were finally processed. The mean age was 51.7 years (SD 19.4; range, 15-84 years), with 49 female and 51 male patients. For each of the scapulae, four morphometric measurements were obtained: anterior glenoid neck (AGN), middle glenoid neck (MGN), posterior glenoid neck (PGN) and alternative posterior glenoid neck (aPGN). Using 3D software, we simulated a reverse shoulder prosthesis, and the scapular notching free range of motion was registered. Differences between measurements were evaluated with an unpaired t-test using StataIC16®. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. The intraobserver and interobserver correlation was evaluated with the intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The AGN measured 7.43 ± 2.52 mm (range, 1.72-13.3 mm); MGN measured 8.05 mm ± 1.93 (range, 2.92-13.2 mm); PGN measured 7.26 ± 2.6 mm (range, 2-13.4 mm); and aPGN measured 8.97 ± 2.3 mm (range, 4.08-15.4 mm). The scapular notching free range of motion for the "long neck" group was 74.98° ± 7.35 (range, 55-83°) and for the "short neck" group, it was 62.93° ± 6.84 (range, 45-70°) (p = 0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of posterior glenoid neck length exhibits excellent reliability and reproducibility, as well as being associated to the scapular notching free range of motion. STUDY DESIGN: Basic, retrospective, CT images research.

AB  - Motion analysis using inertial measurement units (IMU) has emerged as an alternative to optical motion capture. However, the validity and reliability of upper limb measurements varies significantly between studies. The objective of this study was to determine how sensor placement affects kinematic output in the assessment of motion of the arm, shoulder, and scapula. IMUs were placed proximally/distally on arms, and medially/laterally on the scapula, in a group of eleven healthy participants, while performing nine different motion tasks. Linear regressions and mixed models analysed how these different sensor placements affected the estimated joint motion by establishing the linear relationship between sensors placed on the same body segment. The placement of sensors affected the measured kinematic output considerably, most prominent affect was seen for sensor placement on scapula during flexion and abduction, and on forearm during pronation/supination. The slope of the linear regression lines was 2.5 during flexion, 2.7 during abduction, and 1.8 for forearm pronation/supination. The results of this study suggest that the forearm sensor should be placed on the dorsal side of the forearm, at the distal end; the upper arm sensor should be placed laterally, on the distal part of the arm; and the sensor on the scapula should be placed cranially, along the spine of scapula.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brachial plexus birth palsy remains a frequent condition and one of its treatments is to transfer the Latissimus Dorsi tendon to the infraspinatus muscle. The aim of this study was to analyse, for the first time, the three-dimensional kinematic effects of this operation on the upper limb joints during the five Mallet tasks and their correlation with clinical parameters. METHODS: Kinematic analysis was performed using an electromagnetic device. An Index of Improvement taking into account the angle in preop and postop, the reproducibility and the angle of a control group was developed. Three groups of patients were analysed: sixteen patients (mean: 10,5â¯years) for the reproducibility, thirty children (mean: 9,5â¯years) for the control group and ten patients (mean: 8â¯years 7â¯months) who were operated. FINDINGS: The humerothoracic and glenohumeral external rotations improved during the external rotation, the neck and the abduction tasks and worsened during the spine task. The glenohumeral external rotation worsened during the mouth task. The Humerothoracic abduction improved during the abduction and the neck tasks. The elbow flexion improved for the neck task. Differences were observed between patients and correlations were obtained between the Index of Improvement and clinical parameters. INTERPRETATION: Using kinematics allows to better analyse the evolution of joint angles after the latissimus dorsi transfer. The Index of Improvement allows to quickly analyse the effect of the operation for each angle and each patient. This effect depends on clinical parameters.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and assess a novel guidance technique and instrumentation system for minimally invasive short-stemmed total shoulder arthroplasty that will help to reduce the complications associated with traditional open replacement such as poor muscle healing and neurovascular injury. We have answered key questions about the developed system including (1) can novel patient-specific guides be accurately registered and used within a minimally invasive environment?; (2) can accuracy similar to traditional techniques be achieved? METHODS: A novel intra-articular patient-specific guide was developed for use with a new minimally invasive posterior surgical approach that guides bone preparation without requiring muscle resection or joint dislocation. Additionally, a novel set of instruments were developed to enable bone preparation within the minimally invasive environment. The full procedure was evaluated in six cadaveric shoulders, using digitizations to assess accuracy of each step. RESULTS: Patient-specific guide registration accuracy in 3D translation was 2.2±1.2mm (RMSE±1 SD; p = 0.007) for the humeral component and 2.7±0.7mm (p<0.001) for the scapula component. Final implantation accuracy was 2.9±3.0mm (p = 0.066) in translation and 5.7-6.8±2.2-4.0° (0.001<p<0.009) across the humerus implants' three rotations. Similarly, the glenoid component's implantation accuracy was 3.0±1.7mm (p = 0.008) in translation and 2.3-4.3±2.2-4.4° (0.008<p<0.09) in rotation. CONCLUSION: This system achieves minimally invasive shoulder replacement with accuracy similar to traditional open techniques while avoiding common causes of complications. SIGNIFICANCE: This novel technique could lead to a paradigm shift in shoulder arthroplasty for patients with moderate arthritis, which could significantly improve rehabilitation and functional outcomes.

AB  - We developed a real-time sleep stage classification system with a convolutional neural network using only a one-channel electro-encephalogram source from mice and universally available features in any time-series data: raw signal, spectrum, and zeitgeber time. To accommodate historical information from each subject, we included a long short-term memory recurrent neural network in combination with the universal features. The resulting system (UTSN-L) achieved 90% overall accuracy and 81% multi-class Matthews Correlation Coefficient, with particularly high-quality judgements for rapid eye movement sleep (91% sensitivity and 98% specificity). This system can enable automatic real-time interventions during rapid eye movement sleep, which has been difficult due to its relatively low abundance and short duration. Further, it eliminates the need for ordinal pre-calibration, electromyogram recording, and manual classification and thus is scalable. The code is open-source with a graphical user interface and closed feedback loop capability, making it easily adaptable to a wide variety of end-user needs. By allowing large-scale, automatic, and real-time sleep stage-specific interventions, this system can aid further investigations of the functions of sleep and the development of new therapeutic strategies for sleep-related disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Professional bus drivers report a high prevalence of upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain which could be associated with scapular dyskinesis (SD). However, the evidence for valid and reliable screening methods for this condition is limited as SD among bus drivers is an emerging area of research. Therefore, the main aim of the study was to investigate the reliability of dynamic scapular motion test (DSMT) using video analysis as an accurate method to evaluate SD and to identify patterns of SD among bus drivers. METHODS: In total, 32 bus drivers from a private bus company with unilateral upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain participated in the study. The DSMT was conducted and the SD was captured in the video during shoulder flexion-abduction movements. Two investigators analyzed the video recordings and identified the patterns of SD. The intra- and interrater reliability were determined using the percentage of agreement and weighted Kappa coefficients (Kw). Descriptive analysis was used to examine the patterns of SD. FINDINGS: The intra- and interrater reliability of DSMT using video analysis were excellent (Kw coefficient: 0.762-0.878 and 0.87-1.00, respectively). About 56.2% and 53.1% of bus drivers presented SD with the shoulder flexion and abduction movements during DSMT. Medial border prominence (Type II pattern of SD) was identified as the common pattern of SD. CONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: The DSMT using video analysis showed excellent intra- and interrater reliability to evaluate SD. Occupational health practitioners can consider DSMT using video analysis to identify SD among people with upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain at the workplace.

AB  - BACKGROUD: Reliable scapular upward rotation and anterior-posterior tilt data are required for patients with subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS). Only a few studies have explored the reliability of such measurements derived using a modified inclinometer. OBJECTIVES: To determine the relative and absolute reliability of scapular upward rotation and anterior-posterior tilt measurements derived using a modified digital inclinometer in patients with SIS. METHOD: Seventeen SIS patients were assessed twice within 1 week. We determined the relative and absolute measurement reliability by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), and minimal clinically important difference (MCID). Both intra- and interrater reliability were determined. RESULTS: The intra-rater reliability (both measurements) was high (0.72-0.88), and the interrater ICC was high to excellent (0.72-0.98). Clinically acceptable SEM and MCID values were obtained for scapular upward rotation (SEM: 4.28-9.33&#8728;, MCID: 5.1-11.3&#8728;) and anterior-posterior tilt (SEM: 3.72-7.55&#8728;, MCID: 2.5-10.8&#8728;). CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of scapular upward rotation and anterior-posterior tilt using a modified digital inclinometer reliably reveal scapular position and kinematics in patients with SIS.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Individuals with shoulder and upper extremity pathology often present with altered scapular motion. Few studies have looked at variations in scapular acceleration as a way of quantifying scapular motion. The purpose was to determine the effectiveness of wireless accelerometers for detecting changes in acceleration in individuals with scapular dyskinesis. MATERIALS/METHODS: Twenty-seven asymptomatic college students (mean age 24 (SD ± 1.54), 65% female, 93% right handed) were visually screened for scapular dyskinesis using previously described criteria. Of the students recruited, fifteen students were determined to have scapular dyskinesis. After securing a wireless accelerometer (MyoResearch 3D DTS) on the dominate scapula, the participants performed five repetitions of standing scaption from 0 to 140°. Linear scapular accelerations along three orthogonal axes (frontal-y, transverse-z, and sagittal-x) were collected. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC3, k) were used to determine the between day intra-rater reliability while a one-way analysis of variance was used to determine differences in acceleration between those with and without dyskinesis. RESULTS: There was good between day intra-rater reliability for the average of all three axes (ICC = 0.79) and for the x and y axes (ICC > 0.78). Reliability was poor (ICC = 0.31) for the z-axis. There was a significant increase in overall acceleration of the scapula in those with dyskinesis (p = .039). There was also a significant increase in acceleration along the y-axis for those with dyskinesis (p = .003) but not for the other axes (p > .16). CONCLUSION: Wireless accelerometers reliably quantify scapular acceleration in healthy individuals. In a healthy population with dyskinesis, the overall magnitude of scapular acceleration was greater when compared to a healthy group without dyskinesis.

AB  - PURPOSE: The goal of the study is to determine the inter-rater agreement on multiple factors that were utilized to evaluate the quality of pediatric chest X-ray exams from different levels of healthcare provision in an African setting. METHODS: The image quality of pediatric chest X-rays from 3 South African medical centers of varying level of healthcare service were retrospectively assessed by 3 raters for 12 quality factors including: (1) absent body parts; (2) under inspiration; (3) patient rotation; (4) scapula in the way; (5) patient kyphosis/lordosis; (6) artefact/foreign body; (7) central vessel visualization; (8) peripheral vessels visualization; (9) poor collimation; and (10) trachea and bronchi visualization; (11) post-cardiac vessel visualization; and (12) absent or wrong image orientation. Analysis was performed using the Brennan--Prediger coefficient of agreement for inter-rater reliability and Cochran's Q statistic and McNemar's test for inter-rater bias. RESULTS: 1077 X-rays were reviewed. The least difference between observers in the frequency of the errors was noticed for factors (1) absent body parts and (12) absent or wrong image orientation with almost perfect agreement between raters. &#954; score for these two factors among all raters and between each pair of raters was more than 0.95 with no significant inter-rater bias. Conversely, there was poor agreement for the remaining factors with the least agreed on being factor (3) patient rotation with a &#954; score of 0.23. This was followed by factors (2) under inspiration (&#954; score of 0.32) and factors (4) scapula in the way (&#954; score of 0.35) respectively. There was significant inter-rater bias for all these three factors. CONCLUSION: Many of the factors used to assess the quality of a chest X-ray in children demonstrate poor reliability despite mitigation against variations in training, standard quality definitions and level of healthcare service provision. New definitions, objective measures and recording tools for assessing pediatric chest radiographic quality are required.

AB  - The shoulder is one of the human body's most complex joint systems, with motion occurring through the coordinated actions of four individual joints, multiple ligaments, and approximately 20 muscles. Unfortunately, shoulder pathologies (e.g., rotator cuff tears, joint dislocations, arthritis) are common, resulting in substantial pain, disability, and decreased quality of life. The specific etiology for many of these pathologic conditions is not fully understood, but it is generally accepted that shoulder pathology is often associated with altered joint motion. Unfortunately, measuring shoulder motion with the necessary level of accuracy to investigate motion-based hypotheses is not trivial. However, radiographic-based motion measurement techniques have provided the advancement necessary to investigate motion-based hypotheses and provide a mechanistic understanding of shoulder function. Thus, the purpose of this article is to describe the approaches for measuring shoulder motion using a custom biplanar videoradiography system. The specific objectives of this article are to describe the protocols to acquire biplanar videoradiographic images of the shoulder complex, acquire CT scans, develop 3D bone models, locate anatomical landmarks, track the position and orientation of the humerus, scapula, and torso from the biplanar radiographic images, and calculate the kinematic outcome measures. In addition, the article will describe special considerations unique to the shoulder when measuring joint kinematics using this approach.

AB  - Age affects gross shoulder range of motion (ROM), but biomechanical changes over a lifetime are typically only characterized for the humerothoracic joint. Suitable age-related baselines for the scapulothoracic and glenohumeral contributions to humerothoracic motion are needed to advance understanding of shoulder injuries and pathology. Notably, biomechanical comparisons between younger or older populations may obscure detected differences in underlying shoulder motion. Herein, biplane fluoroscopy and skin-marker motion analysis quantified humerothoracic, scapulothoracic, and glenohumeral motion during 3 static poses (resting neutral, internal rotation to L4-L5, and internal rotation to maximum reach) and 2 dynamic activities (scapular plane abduction and external rotation in adduction). Orientations during static poses and rotations during active ROM were compared between subjects <35 years and >45 years of age (N = 10 subjects per group). Numerous age-related kinematic differences were measured, ranging 5-22°, where variations in scapular orientation and motion were consistently observed. These disparities are on par with or exceed mean clinically important differences and standard error of measurement of clinical ROM, which indicates that high resolution techniques and appropriately matched controls are required to avoid confounding results of studies that investigate shoulder kinematics. Understanding these dissimilarities will help clinicians manage expectations and treatment protocols where indications and prevalence between age groups tend to differ. Where possible, it is advised to select age-matched control cohorts when studying the kinematics of shoulder injury, pathology, or surgical/physical therapy interventions to ensure clinically important differences are not overlooked.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Shoulder assessment in rehabilitation is focused on kinematic properties due to the variability of symptomatology and clinical expression of shoulder injuries. AIM: To perform a receiver operating characteristic analysis of the kinematic variables involved in the functional mobility of the shoulder that allow the identification of discriminating variables between healthy and diseased shoulders during scaption motion. METHOD: Analytical cross-sectional study of diagnostic effectiveness was performed in 27 subjects suffering from shoulder damage and 14 asymptomatic controls. Scaption kinematics were evaluated using four inertial sensors placed on the humerus, scapula, forearm and sternum. Three variables (mobility, velocity and acceleration) were obtained from each sensor and the norm of the resultant vector was calculated from each axis. A discriminatory receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed, obtaining the area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity. FINDINGS: Significant differences from both the resultant vectors and the axis depended on the body segment analysed were observed. Greater movement velocity and acceleration were observed in the asymptomatic group. Receiver operating characteristic analysis, scapular protraction-retraction mobility distinguished with a diagnostic sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 90.9% between asymptomatic and shoulder-damaged patients. These diagnosis values were 83.3% and 72.7% for scapular anterior-posterior velocity. Scapular kinematics, in terms of mobility and velocity, are the key variables in shoulder assessment. INTERPRETATION: This study discriminated between patients suffering from shoulder damage and asymptomatic subjects based on shoulder kinematics during scaption motion. Scapular mobility and velocity were found to be key variables in shoulder assessment, along with the humerus.

AB  - Optimal throwing speed and accuracy is built on a complex interaction of multiple variables. Although strength and power has been associated with throwing speed in cricketers, the individual muscles that contribute to optimal function of the shoulder-complex has not been adequately explored in connection with throwing performance. Consequently, this study aimed to investigate the correlation between musculoskeletal variables and overhead throwing performance in cricketers. Thirty-two amateur male cricketers were tested using a battery of 16 tests (strength, flexibility, scapula positioning) as well as a throwing speed (TS) and a novel accuracy test (TA). Only two of the sixteen tests were correlated with throwing performance in the multiple regression analysis. Non-dominant hip abduction strength correlated positively with TS (p < 0.05): on average, a strength increase of 10 newtons (N) was associated with an increase in TS of 0.60âkm/h (95% CI: 0.12-1.08). Non-dominant pectoralis minor length correlated positively with TA (p < 0.01): on average, a one-centimetre increase in the length correlated to an increase, of 0.633 points (95% CI: 0.225-1.041). This cross-sectional study demonstrated that from an array of musculoskeletal variables, only non-dominant hip abduction strength correlated with TS, while only non-dominant pectoralis minor length correlated with TA in amateur cricketers.

AB  - Videogrammetry is commonly used to record upper limb motions. However, it cannot track the glenohumeral joint center (GH). GH is required to reconstruct upper limb motions. Therefore, it is often estimated by separately measuring scapular motions using scapular kinematics measurements devices (SKMD). Applications of SKMD are neither straightforward nor always noninvasive. Therefore, this work investigates the feasibility of an alternative method to estimate GH from videogrammetry using a CT/MRI image of subject's glenohumeral joint and without requiring SKMD. In order to evaluate the method's accuracy, its GH estimations were compared to reference GH trajectories. The method was also applied to estimate scapular configurations and reconstruct an abduction motion measured by videogrammetry. The accuracy of GH estimations were within 5 mm, and the reconstructed motion was in good agreement with reported in vivo measurements.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether change in shoulder position between internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) during magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) affects previously defined capsular measurements and to determine the utility of rotation in the diagnosis of instability. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of patients who received a shoulder MRA with humeral IR and ER views. Patients with an arthroscopically confirmed diagnosis of instability and those with clinically stable shoulders, no history of instability, and no MRA findings of instability were identified and compared. Humeral rotation, glenoid retroversion, humeral head subluxation, capsular length, and capsular area using axial sequences of IR and ER views were recorded. Analysis compared IR, ER, and &#916; capsular measurements between groups using independent t tests and univariate and multivariate regression. RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects who were diagnosed with instability were included, along with 28 control subjects. Capsular length, capsular area, and humeral subluxations were significantly greater with ER compared with IR views (P < .001, P < .001, P < .001). Patients with instability displayed greater ER capsular length (P = .0006) and ER capsular area (P = .005) relative to controls. Multivariate logistic regression identified age, weight, sex, ER capsular length, and retroversion to be significant predictors of instability. ER capsular length independently predicts instability with 86% sensitivity and 84% specificity. Interobserver reliability using the intraclass correlation coefficient was rated good or excellent on all measurements. CONCLUSION: Variance in humeral rotation during shoulder MRA significantly affects capsular measurements. Rotational views increase the utility of capsular measurements when assessing for instability, particularly capsular length and capsular area. The implementation of ER positioning enhances the ability to examine capsular changes of the shoulder joint and can assist in the diagnosis of instability. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, retrospective comparative study.

AB  - CONTEXT: A single clinical assessment device that can be used to objectively measure scapular motion in each anatomical plane is not currently available. The development of a novel electric goniometer would allow scapular motion in all 3 anatomical planes to be quantified. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reliability and validity of an electric goniometer for measuring scapular motion in each anatomical plane during upper extremity elevation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Sixty participants (29 women, 31 men; age = 30 ± 14 years, height = 1.73 ± 0.10 m, mass = 75.32 ± 16.90 kg) recruited from the general population. INTERVENTION(S): An electric goniometer was used to record clinical measurements of scapular position at rest and total arc of motion (excursion) during active upper extremity elevation in 2 testing sessions separated by several days. Measurements were recorded independently by 2 examiners. In 1 session, scapular motion was recorded simultaneously using a 14-camera, 3-dimensional optical motion-capture system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Reliability analysis included examination of clinical measurements for scapular position at rest and excursion during each condition. Both the intrarater reliability between testing sessions and the interrater reliability recorded in the same session were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs [2,3]). The criterion validity was examined by comparing the mean excursion values of each condition recorded using the electric goniometer and the 3-dimensional optical motion-capture system. Validity was assessed by evaluating the average difference and root mean square error. RESULTS: The between-sessions intrarater reliability was moderate to good (ICC [2,3] range = 0.628-0.874). The within-session interrater reliability was moderate to excellent (ICC [2,3] range = 0.545-0.912). The average difference between total excursion values recorded using the electric goniometer and the 3-dimensional optical motion-capture system ranged from -7° to 4°, and the root mean square error ranged from 7° to 10°. CONCLUSIONS: The reliability of scapular measurements was best when a standard operating procedure was used. The electric goniometer provided an accurate measurement of scapular excursions in all 3 anatomical planes during upper extremity elevation.

AB  - Prevalence of scapular dyskinesis varies across records, with overhead athletes being more frequently affected than non-overhead athletes A number of methods have been described to evaluate scapular kinematics and scapular dyskinesis. The "yes/no" and the "4-type" classification systems are widely accepted and diffusely used among orthopaedics and physical therapists. The inter-rater reliability for both the "yes/no" and the "4-type" classification systems may be different. Moreover, differences between physical therapists and orthopaedic surgeons may exist. Seven examiners (2 orthopaedic surgeons and 5 physical therapists) were asked to evaluate a mixed sequence of video recordings of healthy subjects and patients affected by shoulder, scapular or clavicular disorders and to assess scapular dyskinesis using the "yes/no" and the "4-type" classification systems. Cohen's kappa coefficient (&#954;) and weighted kappa were used to measure inter-rater reliability. Twenty-four subjects were enrolled. In general, the "4- type" system has higher &#954; values than ''yes/no'' classification system and orthopaedic surgeons achieve higher reliability than physical therapists for both systems. The clinical evaluation of active shoulder movements permits reproducible assessment and classification of scapular dyskinesis, in particular for the "4-type" classification system. The "4-type" classification system can be used to assess and classify scapular dyskinesis, especially among orthopaedic surgeons.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is a lack of understanding of the impact of generalized joint mobility, joint hypermobility, and resting scapular position on neurodynamic testing of the median nerve. The objectives of the study were to determine: 1) the reliability of the Beighton score (BS) with and without the cutoff score for general joint hypermobility (GJH); 2) if there are differences in the Median Neurodynamic Test 1 (MNT 1) based on the Beighton cutoff score for GJH; 3) if there are differences in the MNT 1 based on an assessment of resting scapular position; 4) if there are relationships between the BS with and without the cutoff score for GJH, resting scapular position, and MNT 1. METHODS: Testing was performed by two testers at two-time intervals at least 1 week apart. The population of interest was healthy asymptomatic adults. The outcome measures included the BS, resting scapular position, and MNT 1. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC2,1) were 0.52 for intertester reliability at visit 1 and 0.86 at visit 2, with intratester reliability of 0.88 for Tester 1 and 0.71 for Tester 2 for the BS. Intertester prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) values for the Beighton GJH cutoff scores were 0.80-0.84 and 0.80 to 0.92 for intratester reliability. There were no statistically significant differences or relationships for any of the other variables of interest. CONCLUSION: Joint mobility and resting scapular position are not confounding variables when performing MNT 1 in an asymptomatic population.

AB  - Although three-dimensional electromagnetic systems are widely used to evaluate the 3-dimensional scapular kinematics their reliability when testing bilateral upper extremity tasks is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the repeatability of the scapular kinematic analyses using the Flock of Birds (FOB) system during bilateral upper extremity movements. Twenty-one volunteers without shoulder problems were included (aged 24.8 years; body mass index averaged 21.2 kg/m2) to the study. Scapular internal-external rotation, upward-downward rotation, and anterior-posterior tilt was recorded during bilateral arm elevation on sagittal, scapular and frontal planes. Measurements were repeated at 5-7 days intervals. Intra-session and inter-session repeatability were determined using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) scores and standard errors of measurements (SEM). The ICC scores were found to be 0.81 to 0.99 for intra-session measurements and 0.60 to 0.83 for inter-session measurements. The SEM scores were 0.8°-3.4° and 2°-7.2° for the intra and inter-session measurements respectively. The repeatability of the FOB system was excellent for the intra-session measurements, but it was weaker for the inter-session measurements. These results support the use of the FOB system for assessing scapular orientation but the analyses should be conducted more carefully when it is applied to the longitudinal measurements.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the construct validity, criterion validity, and responsiveness of measurement instruments evaluating scapular function. DESIGN: Systematic review of measurement properties. LITERATURE SEARCH: The MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases were systematically searched from inception until March 2019. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies published in Dutch, English, or German were included when they evaluated at least 1 of the measurement properties of interest. No restrictions were made regarding participants' health status. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently evaluated study quality using the COSMIN checklist and extracted and analyzed data. Quality of evidence was graded by measurement property for each distinctive type of measurement. RESULTS: Thirty-one measurement instruments in 14 studies were categorized into instruments to measure scapular posture and movement, and to assess scapular dyskinesis. Quality of evidence was at most moderate for 4 instruments with respect to criterion validity. Of these, criterion validity for instruments measuring scapular protraction/retraction posture and rotation angles up to 120° of thoracohumeral elevation was sufficient. Criterion validity for instruments measuring asymmetrical scapular posture, range of motion, and the lateral scapular slide test was insufficient. Quality of evidence for measurement properties of all other instruments was graded lower. CONCLUSION: There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend any instrument for the clinical examination of scapular function. Measurement instruments to assess scapular dyskinesis are prone to misinterpretation and should therefore not be used as such.

AB  - Introduction: Digital home rehabilitation systems require accurate segmentation methods to provide appropriate feedback on repetition counting and exercise technique. Current segmentation methods are not suitable for clinical use; they are not highly accurate or require multiple sensors, which creates usability problems. We propose a model for accurately segmenting inertial measurement unit data for shoulder rehabilitation exercises. This study aims to use inertial measurement unit data to train and test a machine learning segmentation model for single- and multiple-inertial measurement unit systems and to identify the optimal single-sensor location. Methods: A focus group of specialist physiotherapists selected the exercises, which were performed by participants wearing inertial measurement units on the wrist, arm and scapula. We applied a novel machine learning based segmentation technique involving a convolutional classifier and Finite State Machine to the inertial measurement unit data. An accuracy score was calculated for each possible single- or multiple-sensor system. Results: The wrist inertial measurement unit was chosen as the optimal single-sensor location for future system development (mean overall accuracy 0.871). Flexion and abduction based exercises mostly could be segmented with high accuracy, but scapular movement exercises had poor accuracy. Conclusion: A wrist-worn single inertial measurement unit system can accurately segment shoulder exercise repetitions; however, accuracy varies depending on characteristics of the exercise.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Shoulder complaints have high re-occurrence rates and scapular control seems to be a major influencing factor in sub-acromial impingement syndromes (SIS). Scapular dyskinesia disrupts the scapulohumeral rhythm, altering biomechanical loads on the rotator cuff in shoulder movements. As a result, this disturbs the natural healing process. Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) seems to be a promising treatment approach because it has a focus on motor learning. This case report seeks to illustrate the clinical reasoning and feasibility of applying the comprehensive nature of PNF in a patient who was not responsive to standard physiotherapy. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 47-year-old male, a former professional handball player, was diagnosed with a SIS based upon a rotator-cuff tendinopathy, scapular dyskinesia and degeneration of supraspinatus tendon. The patient presented complaints of right sided shoulder pain in overhead activities and in reaching behind the back. PATIENT MANAGEMENT: PNF-based motor-control training was provided over a period of five weeks. This approach included specified PNF-pattern exercises with specific PNF-facilitation principles and techniques. The results were improvements beyond the minimal clinical important difference and/or minimal detectable change for physical functioning, pain, range of motion, and functional disability of the shoulder. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: PNF provided an opportunity for motor control training, restored altered movement patterns in the patient's daily life activities. The approach addressed motor learning effects and structural impairments. PNF-patterns have been described as: "mimicking functional activities" from daily life and from sports. In cases where standard strengthening and mobilization exercises are not effective, a specified PNF-based therapy has shown to be a feasible alternative.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interpretation of shoulder motion across studies has been complicated due to the use of numerous scapular coordinate systems in the literature. Currently, there are no simple means by which to compare scapular kinematics between coordinate system definitions when data from only one coordinate system is known. RESEARCH QUESTION: How do scapular kinematics vary based on the choice of coordinate system and can average rotation matrices be used to accurately convert kinematics between scapular local coordinate systems? METHODS: Average rotation matrices derived from anatomic landmarks of 51 cadaver scapulae (29â¯M/22â¯F; 59â¯±â¯13 yrs; 26R/25â¯L; 171â¯±â¯11â¯cm; 70â¯±â¯19â¯kg; 23.7â¯±â¯5.5â¯kg/m2) were generated between three common scapular coordinate systems. Absolute angle of rotation was used to determine if anatomical variability within the cadaver population influenced the matrices. To quantify the predictive capability to convert kinematics between the three coordinate systems, the average rotation matrices were applied to scapulothoracic motion data collected from 19 human subjects (10â¯M/9â¯F; 43â¯±â¯17 yrs; 19R; 173â¯±â¯9â¯cm; 71â¯±â¯16â¯kg; 23.6â¯±â¯4.5â¯kg/m2) using biplane fluoroscopy. Root mean squared error (RMSE) was used to compare kinematics from an original coordinate system to the kinematics expressed in each alternative coordinate system. RESULTS: The choice of scapular coordinate system resulted in mean differences in scapulothoracic rotation of up to 23°, with overall different shapes and/or magnitudes of the curves. A single average rotation matrix between any two coordinate systems achieved accurate conversion of scapulothoracic kinematics to within 4° of RMSE of the known solution. The average rotation matrices were independent of sex, side, decomposition sequence, and motion. SIGNIFICANCE: Scapulothoracic kinematic representations vary in shape and magnitude based solely on the choice of local coordinate system. The results of this study enhance interpretability and reproducibility in expressing scapulothoracic motion data between laboratories by providing a simple means to convert data between common coordinate systems. This is necessitated by the variety of available motion analysis techniques and their respective scapular landmark definitions.

AB  - Due to the complex coupling motion of shoulder mechanism, only a small amount of quantitative information is available in the existing literature, although various kinematic models of the shoulder complex have been proposed. This study focused on the specific motion coupling relationship between glenohumeral (GH) joint center displacement variable quantity relative to the thorax coordinate system and humeral elevation angle to describe the shoulder complex. The mechanism model of shoulder complex was proposed with an algorithm designed. Subsequently, twelve healthy subjects performed right arm raising, lowering, as well as raising and lowering (RAL) movements in sixteen elevation planes, and the motion information of the markers attached to the thorax, scapula, and humerus was captured by using Vicon motion capturing system. Then, experimental data was processed and the generalized GH joint with floating center was quantized. Simultaneously, different coupling characteristics were detected during humerus raising as well as lowering movements. The motion coupling relationships in different phases were acquired, and a modified kinematic model was established, with the description of overall motion characteristics of shoulder complex validated by comparing the results with a prior kinematic model from literature, showing enough accuracy for the design of upper limb rehabilitation robots.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the between-day reliability of the scapular locator for measuring scapular rotations during arm elevation in patients without shoulder pain/conditions/disorders. METHODS: Twenty-three asymptomatic individuals were measured during 2 sessions separated by 24 hours. One observer measured scapular position with a scapular locator while participants held their arms at 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120° elevation in the scapular plane. Three trials were performed for each arm position. RESULTS: At 30°, between-day intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for all scapular rotations were poor (ICC 0.10-0.40). At higher arm elevations (60°, 90°, and 120°), ICCs ranged from 0.73 to 0.93 for scapular upward rotation, 0.80 to 0.87 for posterior tilt, and 0.37 to 0.62 for scapular internal rotation. For all scapular rotations, the standard error of measurement was less than 6°, and the smallest detectable difference ranged from 11° to 18°. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate good to excellent reliability for measuring scapular upward/downward rotation and anterior/posterior tilt between 60° and 120° of shoulder elevation in the scapular plane. However, low reliability was found for all scapular rotations at 30° elevation, and for scapular internal rotation at higher arm elevation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary aim was to investigate the effect of inferior shoulder mobilization on scapular and shoulder muscle activity during resisted shoulder abduction in asymptomatic individuals. METHODS: This was a lab-based, repeated-measures, crossover, randomized controlled study. Twenty-two participants were recruited. The order of experimental conditions was randomized. Each participant performed 5 repetitions of resisted shoulder abduction before and after the control and mobilization (grade +IV inferior shoulder mobilization, 3 sets, 60 seconds) conditions. Surface electromyography recorded the muscle activity of anterior, middle, and posterior deltoid; supraspinatus; infraspinatus; upper and lower trapezius; serratus anterior; and latissimus dorsi muscles. RESULTS: Muscle activity levels reduced for infraspinatus (11.3% MVIC, 95% CI: 1.7-20.8), middle (22.4% MVIC, 95% CI: 15.9-28.8) and posterior deltoid (8.7 % MVIC, 95% CI: 4.6-12.9), and serratus anterior (-28.1% MVIC, 95% CI: 15.6-40.8) muscles after the mobilization condition during the eccentric phase of shoulder abduction. No carryover effects were observed, and within-session reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient scores ranging from 0.94 to 0.99). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that inferior glenohumeral mobilization reduces activity levels of some scapular and shoulder muscles. Given the exploratory nature of our study, changes in muscle activity levels may have been found by chance. Confirmatory studies are required.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of altered joint mechanics on cartilage degeneration in in vivo models has not been studied successfully due to a lack of pre-injury information. We aimed 1) to develop an accurate in vivo canine model to measure the changes in joint loading and T2 star (T2*) relaxation time before and after unilateral supraspinatus tendon resections, and 2) to find the relationship between regional variations in articular cartilage loading patterns and T2* relaxation time distributions. METHODS: Rigid markers were implanted in the scapula and humerus of tested dogs. The movement of the shoulder bones were measured by a motion tracking system during normal gaits. In vivo cartilage contact strain was measured by aligning 3D shoulder models with the motion tracking data. Articular cartilage T2* relaxation times were measured by quantitative MRI scans. Articular cartilage contact strain and T2* relaxation time were compared in the shoulders before and 3 months after the supraspinatus tendon resections. RESULTS: Excellent accuracy and reproducibility were found in our in vivo contact strain measurements with less than 1% errors. Changes in articular cartilage contact strain exhibited similar patterns with the changes in the T2* relaxation time after resection surgeries. Regional changes in the articular cartilage T2* relaxation time exhibited positive correlations with regional contact strain variations 3 months after the supraspinatus resection surgeries. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to measure in vivo articular cartilage contact strains with high accuracy and reproducibility. Positive correlations between contact strain and T2* relaxation time suggest that the articular cartilage extracellular matrix may responds to mechanical changes in local areas.

AB  - PURPOSE: Shear-wave elastography has been recognized a useful tool for quantifying muscle stiffness, commonly reported as shear modulus, however the reports on reliability are often limited to test-retest correlations. In this study, we explored the reliability of shear-wave elastography for assessment of the trapezius muscle stiffness and its relationship with low-level muscle activity. METHODS: Twenty participants were included in a two-session experiment. Measurements of shear modulus and muscle activity were performed at rest and during low-level activity, induced by shoulder abduction without additional external resistance. RESULTS: Good to excellent intra-session repeatability (ICC > 0.80) and moderate inter-rater and inter-session reproducibility (ICC = 0.66-0.74) were observed. Typical errors were acceptable (7.6% of the mean value) only for intra-session measurements in resting conditions, but not acceptable for all conditions with low-level muscle activity (10.2-16.6% of the mean value). Inverse relationships between shear modulus and muscle activity at 40° and 60° of shoulder abduction (r = -0.53 and -0.57) were observed on a group level. We also found higher shear modulus in males compared to females, for the parallel probe position compared to the perpendicular position (in relation to muscle fiber orientation), and for the dominant side of the body compared to the non-dominant side. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed an inverse relationship between muscle activity in low-level range and shear modulus on a group level, suggesting inherent passive stiffness could account for a larger portion of the variance (compared to muscle activity) in shear modulus when the muscle activity is low. Our results imply that shear-wave elastography can be used in research exploring muscle stiffness, however, caution is needed since only intra-session examination in resting conditions showed acceptable within-participant typical errors. The secondary analyses of the study showed higher shear modulus for males, for the non-dominant side of the body and for the parallel orientation of the ultrasound probe.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the intra and interobserver reproducibility of a new system that assesses the three-dimensional humero-scapulo-thoracic kinematics using wearable technology in an outpatient setting. To obtain normative data with the system for scapular angular motions in three planes. METHODS: The SHoW Motion 3D kinematic tracking system is a motion analysis system that uses wireless wearable non-invasive inertial-magnetic sensors to assess the three-dimensional kinematics of the shoulder girdle. The sensors are placed over the skin in the sternum, scapular spine and arm to precisely define angular motions of the humerus and the scapula with three Degrees of Freedom (DOF) for each segment. The system was used to measure the scapular angular motions in three planes (upward/downward rotation, internal/external rotation and anterior/posterior tilt) during two shoulder full-range movements (flexion/extension and abduction/abduction) in both shoulders of 25 healthy volunteers (13 males and 12 females, mean age: 37 [standard deviation 11.1] years). In a first measuring session one examiner made two evaluations alternating with another examiner that made a third evaluation. In a second session, one week apart, the first examiner made a fourth evaluation. A mean curve was computed from the normalized data for each measurement to obtain normative data for scapular angular kinematics. Intra and inter-observer reproducibility was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error Estimation (RMSE) and Coefficients for Multiple Correlations (CMC). RESULTS: Both shoulders of the 25 volunteers were evaluated four times. The two hundred resulting kinematic analyses were pooled to get normative values for relations between humeral elevation angles and the three angular movements of the scapula. The system showed at least very good (CMC > 0.90) intra and inter-observer reproducibility for scapular tilt and upward-downward rotations both in flexion and abduction. For scapular internal-external rotation the results were acceptable (CMC > 0.75) but not as good, especially for the abduction movement. RMSE calculations showed consistently good reproducibility with RSME< 4° for all three angles evaluated in flexion and abduction. CONCLUSION: The SHoW Motion 3D kinematic tracking system is a quick, reproducible and easy to use system for the assessment of scapular angular kinematics in healthy adults. The data obtained is similar to that obtained with other validated methods. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The presented system is portable, easy to use and fast. It also has good intra and inter-observer reproducibility, making it a good tool to assess objectively scapular dyskinesis in the clinical setting. The normative data obtained is consistent with previous information available.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No previous studies have investigated whether the extent of scapular dyskinesis is associated with shoulder dysfunction. This study aimed (1) to establish the reliability of a scapulometer in patients with shoulder pain and (2) to investigate the related factors associated with shoulder dysfunction. METHODS: One hundred participants with symptomatic scapular dyskinesis were recruited. Twenty-one participants were involved in the reliability study to test the intrarater and inter-rater reliabilities of the scapulometer in patients with shoulder pain. After demographic data and self-reported Flexilevel Scale of Shoulder Function (FLEX-SF) scores were recorded, all participants were measured with a scapulometer to determine the posterior displacement of the root of the spine (ROS) and the inferior angle (IFA) of the scapula from the thorax. Next, the participants performed 5 trials of bilateral scapular plane elevation for scapular kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) data collection. Stepwise multiple linear regressions were used to determine the relationships between self-reported FLEX-SF scores and potential factors. In addition to scapular displacement, pain level, scapular kinematics, and EMG data were included as independent variables. RESULTS: The intrarater and inter-rater reliabilities of the scapulometer were excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.93-0.97) and moderate to good (ICC = 0.74-0.81), respectively. The Bland-Altman plots showed no systematic bias between raters in the ROS and IFA measurements. Final stepwise multiple regression models showed that more ROS distance, higher serratus anterior activity, and lower pain level during arm elevation were associated with higher shoulder function (total R2 = 0.253). CONCLUSION: The reliability of the scapulometer in patients with shoulder pain is moderate to excellent. Scapular dyskinesis may be a compensatory strategy to avoid shoulder pain and improve shoulder function.

AB  - Background: This study intends to summarize the causes, clinical examination, and treatments of scapular dyskinesis (SD) and to briefly investigate whether alteration can be managed by a precision rehabilitation protocol planned on the basis of features derived from clinical tests. Methods: We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL and EMBASE databases using various combinations of the keywords "Rotator cuff", "Scapula", "Scapular Dyskinesis", "Shoulder", "Biomechanics" and "Arthroscopy". Results: SD incidence is growing in patients with shoulder pathologies, even if it is not a specific injury or directly related to a particular injury. SD can be caused by multiple factors or can be the trigger of shoulder-degenerative pathologies. In both cases, SD results in a protracted scapula with the arm at rest or in motion. Conclusions: A clinical evaluation of altered shoulder kinematics is still complicated. Limitations in observing scapular motion are mainly related to the anatomical position and function of the scapula itself and the absence of a tool for quantitative SD clinical assessment. High-quality clinical trials are needed to establish whether there is a possible correlation between SD patterns and the specific findings of shoulder pathologies with altered scapular kinematics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The literature suggests implantation of the humeral component in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) in 0°-40° of retrotorsion without further specification. We hypothesized that optimal humeral component retrotorsion to avoid notching and gain balanced rotational capacity would depend on scapular position and posture. METHODS: We investigated 200 shoulders in 100 patients with available whole-body computed tomography scans and created 3-dimensional models. Implantation of a humeral component in 20° of retrotorsion was simulated, and a correction angle (CA) to yield perfect opposition to the glenosphere was calculated. Patient-specific variables such as age, sex, posture, and scapular orientation parameters were correlated with this CA. RESULTS: Scapular orientation showed large interindividual differences. A highly significant correlation was seen between the CA and scapular internal rotation (R = 0.71, P < .001) and protraction (R = 0.39, P < .001). When the CA was adjusted for glenoid retroversion, the correlation coefficient of scapular internal rotation increased even further (R = 0.91, P < .001). Scapular internal rotation itself showed a correlation with thoracic kyphosis (R = 0.27, P < .001), protraction (R = 0.57, P < .001), tilt (R = 0.29, P < .001), and scapular translation (R = -0.23, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Scapular orientation and posture should be integrated into the determination process of humeral component retrotorsion in RTSA. In theory, implantation of the humeral component with increased retrotorsion leads to improved neutral opposition of the RTSA components in patients with extensive internal rotation of the scapula. On the basis of varying scapular internal rotation, we propose the distinction of 3 different posture types (A-C) for enhanced appraisal of scapulothoracic orientation.

AB  - PURPOSE: The gracilis tendon (GT) is a commonly used autologous graft in Orthopaedic surgery. The majority of information on knee function and outcomes after hamstring harvest is related to both semitendinosus and GT harvest. Little is known regarding isolated harvest of a GT. It was hypothesized that isolated GT harvest would lead to altered gait patterns (e.g. augmented anterior-posterior translation or rotation in the tibiofemoral joint) and consequently a higher prevalence of cartilage lesions and meniscal tears in knees. METHODS: GT harvesting was performed on patients with chronic acromioclavicular joint instability without previous knee injuries or surgeries. MRI of both knees and thighs were performed. Knee MRI were evaluated using the Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS). Inter- and intraobserver reliabilities, cross-sectional areas of different muscles, fatty infiltration of the gracilis muscle (GM) and GT regeneration were evaluated. The contralateral limb served as reference. The observers were blinded towards the identity of the patients and the operatively treated side. RESULTS: After a mean time of 44 months after surgery testing was performed on 12 patients. No significant side-to-side differences were found using WORMS, although there was a trend towards increased cartilage lesions after GT harvest (median healthy knee 4.8 and GT harvested knee 7.8 p = 0.086). Inter- and intraobserver repeatability was high with 0.899 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.708-0.960) and 0.988 (95% CI 0.973-0.995), respectively. A significant hypotrophy of the GM with a mean decrease of 25.3%, 18.4% and 16.9% occurred at 25% (p = 0.016), 50% (p = 0.007) and 75% (p = 0.002) of the length of the femur from distal. No compensatory hypertrophy of other thigh muscles or increased fatty infiltration of the GM was found. Tendon regeneration took place in eight out of 12 patients. In case of regeneration, the regenerated tendon inserted in a more proximal place. CONCLUSION: Isolated harvest of the GT for shoulder procedures did not affect knee MRI significantly indicating therefore in general suitable graft utilization for surgeries outside of the knee. GT regenerated in most patients with just a more proximal insertion and a hypotrophy of the muscle belly.

AB  - Adhesive capsulitis (AC) is a glenohumeral (GH) joint condition, characterized by decreased GH joint range of motion (ROM) and compensatory ROM in the elbow and scapulothoracic (ST) joint. To evaluate AC progression in clinical settings, objective movement analysis by available systems would be valuable. This study aimed to assess within-session and intra- and inter-operator reliability/agreement of such a motion capture system. The MVN-Awinda® system from Xsens Technologies (Enschede, The Netherlands) was used to assess ST, GH, and elbow ROM during four tasks (GH external rotation, combing hair, grasping a seatbelt, placing a cup on a shelf) in 10 AC patients (mean age = 54 (± 6), 7 females), on two test occasions (accompanied by different operators on second occasion). Standard error of measurements (SEMs) were below 1.5° for ST pro-retraction and 4.6° for GH in-external rotation during GH external rotation; below 6.6° for ST tilt, 6.4° for GH flexion-extension, 7.1° for elbow flexion-extension during combing hair; below 4.4° for GH ab-adduction, 13° for GH in-external rotation, 6.8° for elbow flexion-extension during grasping the seatbelt; below 11° for all ST and GH joint rotations during placing a cup on a shelf. Therefore, to evaluate AC progression, inertial sensors systems can be applied during the execution of functional tasks.

AB  - CONTEXT: The latissimus dorsi plays a major role in generating the propulsive force during swimming. In addition, stiffness of this muscle may result in altered stroke biomechanics and predispose swimmers to shoulder pain. Measuring the flexibility of the latissimus dorsi can be of interest to reduce injury. However, the reliability of such measurement has not yet been investigated in competitive swimmers. OBJECTIVE: To assess the within-session intrarater and interrater reliability of a passive shoulder flexion range of motion measurement for latissimus dorsi flexibility in competitive swimmers. DESIGN: Within-session intrarater and interrater reliability. SETTING: Competitive swimming clubs in Flanders, Belgium. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six competitive swimmers (15.46 [2.98] y; 16 men and 10 women). INTERVENTION: Each rater performed 2 alternating (eg, left-right-left-right) measurements of passive shoulder flexion range of motion twice, with a 30-second rest period in between. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to assess intrarater and interrater reliability. RESULTS: Interrater intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from .54 (95% confidence interval [CI], -.16 to .81) to .57 (95% CI, -.24 to .85). Results for the intrarater reliability ranged from .91 (95% CI, .81 to .96) to .94 (95% CI, .87 to .97). CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest that shoulder flexion range of motion in young competitive swimmers can be measured reliably by a single rater within the same session.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Decreased pectoralis minor muscle length is common after primary breast cancer treatment and can result in an abnormal position of the scapula. This position can contribute to shoulder pain and pathomechanics and can lead to problems such as impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tears, and frozen shoulder. Currently, there are limited reliable methods for measuring pectoralis minor length. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of measuring pectoralis minor length in women diagnosed with breast cancer. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional reliability and validity study. METHODS: Bilateral pectoralis minor length (in centimeters) was assessed using a palpation meter in women (N = 29) diagnosed with breast cancer by 2 licensed physical therapists who were masked to the measures. Bilateral pectoralis minor length was also measured using a motion capture system to assess validity. RESULTS: Intratester reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC [3,k] = 0.971; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.939-0.986; standard error of measurement [SEM] = 0.16 cm) and intertester reliability (ICC[3,k] = 0.915; 95% CI = 0.81-0.962; SEM = 0.31 cm) were excellent for the palpation meter on the affected side and the unaffected side (intratester reliability: ICC[3,k] = 0.951; 95% CI = 0.897-0.977; SEM = 0.19 cm; intertester reliability: ICC[3,k] = 0.945; 95% CI = 0.877-0.975; SEM = 0.22 cm). Significant correlations were found between the motion capture system and the palpation meter on the affected side (r = 0.87) and the unaffected side (r = 0.81). Bland-Altman plots between the palpation meter and the motion capture system demonstrated that all the measures fell within the limits of agreement. LIMITATIONS: This study encountered possible errors with the accuracy of the motion capture system tracking because of the proximity of the markers and inherent volumetric restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: The palpation meter is a reliable, valid, easily administered, and cost-effective tool for assessing pectoralis minor length in women with breast cancer.

AB  - RATIONALE: Calcific tendinopathy is one of the most frequent causes of nontraumatic shoulder pain. However, intra-articular calcifications appear to be an infrequent condition. We herein report a rare case study of an intra-articular calcification of the acromioclavicular joint. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 46-year-old man presented with an acute pain in the anterior superior region of the left shoulder which also radiated to the left cervical region. The man during the physical evaluation also presented severe functional limitation of the shoulder movements in all planes of motion. DIAGNOSES: The diagnosis was carried out through a radiographic and an echotomographic examination, highlighting the intra-articular calcific formation associated to a reactive inflammatory reaction. INTERVENTIONS: An ultrasound-guided percutaneous treatment following the guidelines for calcific tendinopathy of the shoulder was carried out. OUTCOMES: The posttreatment was satisfactory with the disappearance of the pain and the recovery of the shoulder movements in all planes of motion. LESSONS: We can affirm that the ultrasound-guided percutaneous treatment in patients with calcification of the acromion-clavicular joint represents a valid and nonpainful therapeutic treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Compensations are commonly employed by patients with stroke during rehabilitation without therapist supervision, leading to suboptimal recovery outcomes. This study investigated the feasibility of the real-time monitoring of compensation in patients with stroke by using pressure distribution data and machine learning algorithms. Whether trunk compensation can be reduced by combining the online detection of compensation and haptic feedback of a rehabilitation robot was also investigated. METHODS: Six patients with stroke did three forms of reaching movements while pressure distribution data were recorded as Dataset1. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained with features extracted from Dataset1. Then, two other patients with stroke performed reaching tasks, and the SVM classifier trained by Dataset1 was employed to classify the compensatory patterns online. Based on the real-time monitoring of compensation, a rehabilitation robot provided an assistive force to patients with stroke to reduce compensations. RESULTS: Good classification performance (F1 score > 0.95) was obtained in both offline and online compensation analysis using the SVM classifier and pressure distribution data of patients with stroke. Based on the real-time detection of compensatory patterns, the angles of trunk rotation, trunk lean-forward and trunk-scapula elevation decreased by 46.95%, 32.35% and 23.75%, respectively. CONCLUSION: High classification accuracies verified the feasibility of detecting compensation in patients with stroke based on pressure distribution data. Since the validity and reliability of the online detection of compensation has been verified, this classifier can be incorporated into a rehabilitation robot to reduce trunk compensations in patients with stroke.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This is a systematic review. INTRODUCTION: Scapular taping is widely used in the management of scapular dysfunction. However, its effects on the scapular kinematics and the electromyography (EMG) activity of the periscapular muscles are not clear. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of the study was to systematically review the current literature to examine whether scapular corrective taping alters the EMG activity of the periscapular muscles and the 3-dimensional scapular kinematics. METHOD: MEDLINE and Web of Science databases were searched using specific mesh terms up to April 2018. A hand search was also conducted on the reference list of the included articles. A total of 157 studies were identified, and they were further analyzed for the eligibility to the systematic review. Studies that investigated the effects of scapular corrective taping on the EMG activity of the periscapular muscles and on the 3-dimensional scapular kinematics on patients with shoulder problems or asymptomatic subjects were eligible for the systematic review. The Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care criteria were modified and used for the risk-of-bias assessment. RESULTS: Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. Five studies investigated the effects of corrective taping on the scapular kinematics and 8 studies reported the effects of corrective taping on the EMG activity of the periscapular muscles. There was an agreement among the studies that scapular upward rotation is increased with the corrective taping, while there are inconsistent results concerning the scapular external rotation and posterior tilt. In addition, studies mostly reported that corrective taping decreases the activity of the upper trapezius, while it has conflicting effects on the activity patterns of other periscapular muscles. DISCUSSION: Scapular corrective taping was found to increase the scapular upward rotation; however, its effects on scapular external rotation and posterior tilt are controversial. It was also found that corrective taping might decrease the EMG activity of the upper trapezius, while it had no effects on the activity of lower trapezius, and its effects on other periscapular muscles were controversial. CONCLUSION: The results of the studies indicated that scapular corrective taping might alter the 3-dimensional scapular kinematics, while there are controversies about the effects of corrective taping on the EMG activity of the periscapular muscles. Further studies are needed to clarify the conflicts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Examine the ability of a dynamic scapular recognition exercise to improve scapular upward rotation and decrease shoulder pain and disability in patients with adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. METHODS: A test-retest randomized controlled study design was used. A total of sixty-six patients with unilateral adhesive capsulitis were equally divided into two groups. The study group received a dynamic scapular recognition exercise using a wireless biofeedback system, while the control group received placebo treatment in the form of active range-of-motion (ROM) exercises of the sound upper limb. A digital inclinometer was used to measure the scapular upward rotation and ROM of the shoulder joint, and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) was used to measure the shoulder pain and disability. RESULTS: Study results showed that after two weeks, there were statistically significant differences between the study and control groups in scapular upward rotation and shoulder flexion and abduction (P < .05) and nonsignificant differences in shoulder external rotation and SPADI (P > .05). After two and six months, there were statistically significant differences between study and control groups in scapular upward rotation; shoulder flexion, abduction and external rotation; and SPADI scores (P < .05). CONCLUSION: This study showed that a dynamic scapular recognition exercise significantly improves scapular upward rotation and the ROM of shoulder flexion and abduction after two weeks. At two and six months, this exercise improves scapular upward rotation; ROM of shoulder flexion, abduction, and external rotation; and SPADI scores. These improvements persisted for six months after the performance of this exercise.

AB  - Reconstruction of elbow extension is a first priority in the surgical management of patients with tetraplegia. Traditionally, posterior deltoid and biceps to triceps muscle transfers were used, but in recent years, nerve transfers have become the preferred choice of a few surgeons. However, nerve transfer reconstruction failures exist, often related to poor donor nerves, prolonged intervals between the injury and surgery, and advanced patient age. As a valid surgical alternative in such cases, we propose transferring the lower trapezius muscle to reconstruct elbow extension, because this procedure is already being performed successfully in patients with brachial plexus injury. We report 2 patients in whom a lower trapezius transfer was employed as a successful salvage procedure after failed nerve transfer surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) is the gold standard to measure early implant migration which is a predictive factor for implant survival. PURPOSE: To validate an alternative computed tomography (CT) technique to measure implant migration in shoulder arthroplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cadaver proximal humerus and a scapula, which had tantalum beads incorporated within them, were prepared to accept a short-stemmed humeral component and a two-pegged glenoid component of a commercial total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) system. A five degree of freedom micrometer and goniometer equipped rig was used to translate and rotate the implant components relative to the respective bone to predetermined positions. Double CT examinations were performed for each position and CT motion analysis software (CTMA) was used to assess these movements. The accuracy and precision of the software was estimated using the rig's micrometers and goniometers as the gold standard. The technique's effective dose was also assessed. RESULTS: The accuracy was in the range of 0.07-0.23 mm in translation and 0.22-0.71° in rotation. The precision was in the range of 0.08-0.15 mm in translation and 0.23-0.54° in rotation. The mean effective dose for the CT scans was calculated to be 0.27 mSv. CONCLUSION: In this experimental setting, accuracy, precision, and effective dose of the CTMA technique were found to be comparable to that of RSA. Therefore, we believe clinical studies are warranted to determine if CTMA is a suitable alternative to traditional RSA for migration measurements in TSA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate and reliable assessment of acromial tilt (ATA) and slope (ASA) angles have been important in the clinical evaluation of degenerative and traumatic rotator cuff tears. This study analyzed the influence of radiographic viewing perspective on the ATA and ASA and developed criteria to identify true lateral (TL) view radiographs. METHODS: Three-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) reconstructions of 52 scapulae without rotator cuff tears or osteoarthritis were studied. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were aligned to obtain a TL view. In 10 random scapulae, incremental ante- and retroversion and up- and downward rotation views were generated (10° increments, ±30°), and ATA and ASA were measured by 2 observers. Clinically applicable criteria were developed and validated to identify TL views. RESULTS: The mean ATA and ASA on TL views were 33°±4° (range 23°-42°) and 22°±7° (8°-43°), respectively. Mixed effect models showed that DRRs malpositioned in 20° and 30° anteversion and downward rotation decreased the ATA (P &#8804; .030). DRRs malpositioned in anteversion and >10° of up- and downward rotation demonstrated a significantly decreased ASA (P &#8804; .047). Intra- and interobserver reliability was excellent for TL views (intraclass correlation coefficient &#8805; 0.95) but decreased with increasing viewing angle. Anatomic landmark criteria were capable of identifying TL-view radiographs with sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 82%. CONCLUSION: Both ATA and ASA were significantly affected by malposition in anteversion and downward rotation of the scapula. Reliable ASA measurement was more susceptible in up- and downward rotation than the ATA. New visual criteria can identify TL-view radiographs and should be used in future studies to ensure consistency in ATA and ASA measurement.

AB  - AIMS: High string players (violin and viola) often suffer from musculoskeletal disorders. Although 3D motion analysis has proved helpful in diagnosing different musculoskeletal syndromes and identifying injurious movement patterns in violin and viola performance, more detailed analyses of upper body movement strategies and especially of the shoulder complex have not yet been recorded. The use of spherical surface markers on some anatomical landmarks is, however, inappropriate when an instrument is being played. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a novel marker-based method for analyzing upper body kinematics of high string players using conditions specific to violin and viola playing. METHODS: A custom upper body marker set was developed and a biomechanical model applied to 3D motion capture data of the pelvis, thorax, spine, head, and both upper limbs (scapula, upper arm, forearm, hand) of 12 professional violinists, to assess its clinical feasibility. FINDINGS: Lumbar and thoracic spine, thorax, neck, and left upper limb were quite static, while extensive motion occurred in the right upper limb. Most rotation angles showed a reasonable intersubject variability except for glenohumeral and wrist joints. Significant differences were observed between G- and D-string bowing, especially in the left wrist and right shoulder joints. INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that the proposed method is a valid tool for quantifying upper body movements in violin and viola performance. With the extended upper body model, it will improve understanding of the motor strategies adopted by high string players and may contribute to injury prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no published studies of the influence of geometry of the scapula on the postoperative recovery of rotator cuff injuries. Our aim was to explore the relationship between the critical shoulder angle (CSA), acromion index (AI), glenoid inclination (GI), and postoperative repair outcomes in shoulder joints after arthroscopic supraspinatus tendon repair. METHODS: Sixty two patients suffering a supraspinatus tear were analyzed retrospectively following failure of conservative treatment and subsequent shoulder arthroscopy in our hospital. Standard anterior and posterior X-rays of the injured shoulder had been performed prior to surgery, with follow ups for at least 2 years (24-43 months). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed 2 years after surgery to assess repair of the supraspinatus tendon. Patients were divided into either the intact or re-tear group, according to the MRI results. In addition, assessments using the Constant Shoulder Score (CSS), the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon (ASES) Shoulder Assessment Form, the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) score and visual analog scale (VAS) score were performed to establish shoulder function at the 2-year evaluation for each patient. RESULTS: The mean CSA of all patients was 35.79° ± 3.59°, mean AI was 0.72 ± 0.05, and mean GI was 15.87° ± 3.62°. The CSA, AI, and GI in the intact group were statistically significantly different than the re-tear group (p < 0.05). There was no correlation between the magnitude of the CSA, AI, or GI and any shoulder function score (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The geometry of the scapula had no significant effect on the recovery of postoperative function of patients with rotator cuff injury, but the value of the CSA, AI, and GI affected the risk of rotator cuff re-tear.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Constant score (CS) is one of the most frequently applied tools for the assessment of the shoulder joint. However, evaluation of strength is not standardized leading to potential bias when comparing different studies. METHODS: Seventy-six patients with fractures of the proximal humerus undergoing open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) were assessed using standardized CS strength measurements at the deltoid muscle insertion and at the wrist in three different arm positions. Variation coefficients were evaluated for each patient and position. RESULTS: Forty women (57%) and 36 men (43%) were examined 96 months in mean after ORIF. We could state a maximum of 105.3 N difference if measurements were performed at the wrist or the insertion of the deltoid muscle in 90° forward flexion on the injured arm (167.9 ± 83.1 N; 62.6 ± 29.4 N). The lowest variation coefficient of the three performed measurements could be stated at the deltoid muscle insertion in a 90° abduction position in the scapula plane (6.94 ± 5.5). CONCLUSION: Following our study results, different positions of force measurement can change the total CS by a whole category (e.g. "very good" to "good"). We recommend performing the measurement at the insertion of the deltoid muscle in a 90° abduction position in the scapula plane. Otherwise, even in the non-injured, it is hard to reach a "normal" shoulder function, based on the CS. When using the CS as outcome parameter, authors must give detailed information about the force measuring and use an exact measuring device.

AB  - Background: Minimal rotation of the scapula may affect the measurement of critical shoulder angle (CSA). We investigated the difference in the CSA measured in minimal rotation between the patients with rotator cuff tear and those without non-rotator cuff tear and the CSA measurement error by comparing with computed tomography (CT). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tear and whose X-ray views correspond to Suter-Henninger classification type A1 and C1. The CSA values between the normal control group (without rotator cuff tear) and the rotator cuff tear group were compared according to A1 type and C1 type. In the rotator cuff tear group, we compared the CSA values measured by using X-ray and CT. Results: A total of 238 patients (rotator cuff tear group, 139 patients; normal cuff group, 99 patients) were included in this study. The mean CSA of the rotator cuff tear group was 33.4° ± 3.5°, and that of the normal cuff group was 32.6° ± 3.9° (p = 0.085). On comparison of the CSA according to the Suter-Henninger classification type, the CSA values on the A1 type view and C1 type view were 32.7° ± 3.5° and 33.7° ± 3.5°, respectively, in the rotator cuff tear group and 30.5° ± 3.1° and 33.1 ± 3.9°, respectively, in the normal cuff group (p = 0.024 and p = 0.216, respectively). The mean CSA was 32.5° ± 3.1° in CT and 33.3° ± 3.2° in X-ray (p = 0.184). On comparison of the CSA according to the Suter-Henninger classification type, the CSA values on the A1 type view and C1 type view were 32.6° ± 3.6° and 32.5° ± 2.4°, respectively, in CT and 32.5° ± 3.5° and 34.2° ± 2.6°, respectively, in X-ray (p = 0.905 and p = 0.017, respectively). Conclusions: The X-ray view corresponding to Suter-Henninger classification type A1 or CT-reconstructed image can be used to reduce the measurement error and obtain reliable CSA values. The CSA measured on the X-ray view corresponding to Suter-Henninger classification type A1 may be related with rotator cuff tear.

AB  - Biomechanical investigations examining shoulder function commonly observe a high degree of inter-individual variability in muscle activity and kinematic patterns during static and dynamic upper extremity exertions. Substantial differences in musculoskeletal geometry between individuals can alter muscle moment arms and lines of action that, theoretically, alter muscle activity and shoulder kinematics. The purposes of this research were to: (i) quantify model-predicted functional roles (moment arms, lines of action) of the scapulohumeral muscles, (ii) compare model predictions to experimental data in the literature, and (iii) evaluate sensitivity of muscle functional roles due to changes in muscle attachment locations using probabilistic modeling. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to iteratively adjust muscle attachment locations at the clavicle, scapula, and humerus of the Delft Shoulder and Elbow Model in OpenSim. Muscle moment arms and lines of action were quantified throughout arm elevation in the scapular plane. In general, model-predicted moment arms agreed well with the reviewed literature; however, notable inconsistencies were observed when comparing lines of action. Variability in moment arms and lines of action were muscle-specific, with 2 standard deviations in moment arm and line of actions as high as 25.8 mm and 18.8° for some muscles, respectively. Moment arms were particularly sensitive to changes in attachment site closest to the joint centre. Variations in muscle functional roles due to differences in musculoskeletal geometry are expected to require different muscle activity and movement patterns for upper extremity exertions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although it is thought that there is a relationship between neck pain and scapular dysfunction, there are controversial results and no clear information in the literature regarding this issue. This study aimed to investigate the alterations in the 3-Dimensional scapular orientation on patients with non-specific neck pain. METHOD: Thirty-four patients with chronic non-specific neck pain [age, 29.1 (5) years; height, 165.3 (6.1) centimeters; weight, 62.1 (9.6) kilogram] and 29 healthy controls [age, 28.2 (3.3) years; height, 166.8 (8.1) centimeters; weight, 60.9 (8.5) kilogram] were included in the study. 3-Dimensional scapular kinematics were obtained during arm elevation and lowering trials in the sagittal, scapular, and frontal planes. FINDINGS: Compared to healthy controls, the patients with neck pain demonstrated significantly reduced upward scapular rotation on both the dominant and non-dominant sides in all three planes. Patients with neck pain had increased internal rotation in the sagittal and frontal planes on the dominant side and increased external rotation in the frontal plane on the non-dominant side. No difference was observed between groups considering posterior scapular tilt. INTERPRETATION: There are alterations in the 3-Dimensional scapular orientations in patients with chronic non-specific neck pain compared to healthy controls. Therefore, the scapular control may also be examined in patients with neck pain and it can be included in the rehabilitation program if needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential differences in both scapular positioning and scapular movement between the symptomatic and asymptomatic contralateral shoulder, in patients with unilateral subacromial pain syndrome (SAPS), and when compared with participants free of shoulder pain. SETTING: Three different primary care centres. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 73 patients with SAPS in their dominant arm was recruited, with a final sample size of 54 participants. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The scapular upward rotation (SUR), the pectoralis minor and the levator scapulae muscles length tests were carried out. RESULTS: When symptomatic shoulders and controls were compared, an increased SUR at all positions (45°, 90° and 135°) was obtained in symptomatic shoulders (2/3,98/8,96°, respectively). These differences in SUR surpassed the minimal detectable change (MDC95) (0,91/1,55/2,83° at 45/90/135° of shoulder elevation). No differences were found in SUR between symptomatic and contralateral shoulders. No differences were found in either pectoralis minor or levator scapulae muscle length in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: SUR was greater in patients with chronic SAPS compared with controls at different angles of shoulder elevation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is important to monitor progress during rehabilitation of stroke patients. To that end, clinical function tests may be supported by three-dimensional kinematic measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inter- and intra-rater reliability of three-dimensional kinematic measures of shoulder movements in stroke patients with reduced shoulder function. METHODS: Seventeen patients were tested in three sessions by two trained raters. Three-dimensional motion capture was performed of the more affected upper extremity and the trunk. Measures of movements of the scapula and humerus related to the trunk, the trunk related to the laboratory, the forearm related to the humerus, and temporospatial measures were obtained during two reach tasks from the Wolf Motor Function Test, ReachLow and ReachHigh. Inter- and intra-rater reliability was quantified with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). FINDINGS: In general, range of movements of scapula, shoulder, trunk and elbow and movement time and reach length showed high inter-rater reliability (ICC&#8734; 0.84-0.98) and intra-rater reliability (ICC&#8734; 0.75-1.00), A minimum of five trials per task were required to achieve reliable ICC estimates. INTERPRETATION: Selected three-dimensional kinematic measures can be used reliably to evaluate specific movements of the shoulder in stroke patients with reduced shoulder function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening can lead to the failure of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). Estimates of the prevalence of aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening after RTSA are required to guide clinical decisions, but published results are variable and lack precision. The goal of this meta-analysis was to determine a precise estimate of the prevalence of aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening after RTSA and to explore variation in the prevalence according to different variables, such as the type of procedure (primary or revision), preoperative diagnosis, the center of rotation of the glenoid component (medialized or lateralized), study size, the definition of aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening, and the duration of follow-up. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. We searched the MEDLINE and Embase databases for English-language articles describing the outcomes after RTSA with a minimum 12-month follow-up in which radiographic findings of aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening were reported. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and meta-regression was used to explore the influence of variables on heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: One hundred and three studies (covering 6,583 RTSAs) performed from 1991 to 2015 met our inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of radiographic aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening for all RTSAs was 1.16% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80% to 1.69%). The prevalence of aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening was lower among primary RTSAs (0.90%; 95% CI, 0.54% to 1.49%) than among revision RTSAs (3.64%; 95% CI, 1.91% to 6.84%). The pooled prevalence of aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening by diagnosis was 2.69% for osteoarthritis with bone loss, 1.71% for cuff tear arthropathy, 1.20% for rheumatoid arthritis, 1.08% for sequelae of fracture, 0.94% for irreparable massive cuff tear, and 0.25% for acute proximal humeral fracture. The prevalence of aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening was not significantly different for prostheses with a medialized center of rotation (1.15%) versus a lateralized center of rotation (1.84%). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the present study represents the first meta-analysis investigating only aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening after RTSA. Multiple variables were found to be associated with the prevalence of aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening. The rates reported here are lower than those reported previously because of the inclusion of more recent evidence and more studies that evaluated aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The acromion marker cluster (AMC) is a non-invasive scapular motion tracking method. However, it lacks testing in clinical populations, where unique challenges may present. This investigation resolved the utility of the AMC approach in a compromised clinical population. METHODS: The upper body of breast cancer survivors (BCS) and controls were tracked via motion capture and scapular landmarks palpated and recorded using a digitizer at static neutral to maximum elevation postures. The AMC tracked the scapula during dynamic maximum arm abduction. Both single (SC) and double calibration (DC) methods were applied to calculate scapular angles. The influences of calibration method, elevation, and group on mean and absolute error with two-way fixed ANOVAs with interactions (pâ¯<â¯0.05). Root mean square errors (RMSE) were calculated and compared. RESULTS: DC improved AMC estimation of palpated scapular orientation over SC, especially at higher arm elevations; RMSE averaged 11° higher for SC than DC at maximum elevation, but the methods were only 2.2° different at 90° elevation. DC of the AMC yielded mean error values of â¼5-10°. These approximate errors reported for AMC with young, lean adults. CONCLUSIONS: The AMC with DC is a non-invasive method with acceptable error for measuring scapular motion of BCS and age-matched controls.

AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze and compare the diagnostic value and interpretation of 6 established clinical tests for infraspinatus tendon tears; to assess their ability to distinguish between partial- and full-thickness tears of the infraspinatus tendon; and to investigate whether conducting multiple tests increases the precision of diagnosis. METHODS: A total of 91 patients scheduled for shoulder arthroscopy from March 2015 to April 2017 were included in the present study. To assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, diagnostic odds ratio, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and the area under the curve (AUC), intraoperative findings were compared with the results of 6 established clinical infraspinatus tests: the hornblower's test, the drop sign, the Patte sign, the external rotation lag sign (ERLS), the resisted external rotation test (RERT), and the infraspinatus scapular retraction test. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between the results of the drop sign (P = .02), the ERLS (P = .02), and the RERT (P = .02) and the intraoperative findings. The RERT achieved the highest AUC (0.673). Assessing muscle weakness led to the highest diagnostic precision on the RERT (AUC = 0.673) as compared with pain (AUC = 0.528) or using both criteria (AUC = 0.655). No single clinical test was found to be useful in distinguishing between partial- and full-thickness tears. The combination of at least 2 or more tests improved the diagnostic precision significantly (P &#8804; .007). The combination of the RERT and the Patte sign showed the best AUC (0.681) and highest correlation with the intraoperative findings (P = .023). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study indicate that out of all the clinical tests investigated, the drop sign and the RERT were in isolation able to accurately diagnose tears of the infraspinatus tendon. Only muscle weakness should be considered when interpreting the RERT because of its greater AUC values and correlation with the arthroscopic findings. The present study also showed that the analyzed tests are not capable of distinguishing between partial- and full-thickness tears of the infraspinatus tendon and that the combination of at least 2 tests improved the diagnostic value. The combination of the RERT and the Patte sign showed the best AUC and highest correlation with the intraoperative findings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, diagnostic study, prospective comparative study.

AB  - The goal of this study was to develop and validate a non-invasive approach to estimate scapular kinematics in individual patients. We hypothesized that machine learning algorithms could be developed using motion capture data to accurately estimate dynamic scapula orientation based on measured humeral orientations and acromion process positions. The accuracy of the algorithms was evaluated against a gold standard of biplane fluoroscopy using a 2D to 3D fluoroscopy/model matching process. Individualized neural networks were developed for nine healthy adult shoulders. These models were used to predict scapulothoracic kinematics, and the predicted kinematics were compared to kinematics obtained using biplane fluoroscopy to determine the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. Results showed correlations between predicted kinematics and validation kinematics. Estimated kinematics were within 10 of validation kinematics. We concluded that individualized machine learning algorithms show promise for providing accurate, non-invasive measurements of scapulothoracic kinematics.

AB  - PURPOSE: To systematize the surgical outcomes of anatomic and non-anatomic reconstruction in patients with chronic acromio-clavicular joint (ACJ) instability and determine which technique is superior. METHODS: This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to April 30th, 2018 for original articles that assessed the outcomes of one or more surgical techniques of anatomic and non-anatomic reconstruction in patients with chronic ACJ instability. The Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) was used to assess study quality. Pre-to-post meta-analysis was performed for both anatomic and non-anatomic reconstructions. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included comprising 799 patients (mean age of 36.6 years old and 84% males) with a mean follow-up of 34.6 months (range 13 to 74). Surgical techniques included anatomic (tendinous or synthetic grafts/constructs) and non-anatomic reconstruction (Weaver-Dunn or Modified Weaver-Dunn, conjoined tendon transfer, or temporary hook plate). There were significant pre-to-post improvements on the constant score with an average improvement ranging from 11.1 to 50.7 (p < 0.01). Average failure rate was 7.6% (7.5% for anatomic and 8.5% for non-anatomic reconstruction). Non-comparative studies had a mean MINORS score of 9 points (out of 16) and comparative studies 17 (out of 24) with excellent interrater agreement (k = 0.910). CONCLUSION: Both anatomic and non-anatomic ACJ reconstructions provide significant post-operative improvements, but definitive conclusions on optimal technique remain elusive. Notwithstanding, comparative studies support the use of anatomic ACJ reconstruction which should be preferably used. However, until superiority is demonstrated by robust studies, surgeons should supplement their decision-making with experience and patient preference. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.

AB  - PURPOSE: Glenoid bone integrity is crucial for shoulder stability. The purpose of this study was to investigate a non-invasive method for quantifying bone loss regarding reliability and accuracy to detect glenoid bone deficiency in standard two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) measurements at different time points. It was hypothesized that the diameter of the circle used would significantly differ between raters, rendering this method inaccurate and not allowing for an exact estimation of glenoid defect size. METHODS: Fifty-two shoulder CTs from 26 patients (26 2D-CTs; 26 3D-CTs) with anterior glenoid bone defects were evaluated by 6 raters at time 0 (T0) and at least 3 weeks after (T1) to assess the glenoid bone defect using the ratio method ("best fit circle"). Inter- and intra-rater differences concerning circle dimensions (circle diameter), measured width of bone loss and calculated percentage of bone loss (length-width-ratio) were compared in 2D- versus 3D-CT scans. The intraclass coefficient (ICC) was used to determine the inter- and intra-rater agreement. RESULTS: The mean circle diameter difference in 2D-CT was 2.0 ± 1.9 mm versus 1.8 ± 1.5 mm in 3D-CT, respectively (p < 0.01). Mean width of bone loss in 2D-CT was 1.9 ± 1.7 mm compared to 1.7 ± 1.5 mm in 3D-CT, respectively (p < 0.01). The mean difference of bone loss percentage was 5.1 ± 4.8% in 2D-CT and 4.8 ± 4.5% in 3D-CT (p < 0.01). No significant differences concerning circle diameter, bone loss width and bone loss percentage were detected comparing T0 and T1. Circle diameter, bone loss width and bone loss percentage measurements in 3D-CT were significantly smaller compared to 2D-CT at T0 and T1 (p < 0.01). Agreement (ICC) was fair to good for all indicators of circle diameter (range 0.76-0.83), bone loss width (range 0.76-0.86) and percentage of bone loss (range 0.85-0.91). Overall, 3D-CT showed superior agreement compared to 2D-CT. CONCLUSION: The ratio method varies in all glenoid parameters and is not valid for consistently quantifying glenoid bone defects even in 3D computed tomography. This must be taken into consideration when determining proper surgical treatment. The degree of glenoid bone loss alone should not be used to decide for or against a bony procedure. Rather, it is more important to define a defect size as "critical" and to also take other patient-specific factors into consideration so that the best treatment option can be undertaken. Application of the "best fitting circle" is a source of error when using the ratio method; therefore, care should be taken when measuring the circle diameter. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

AB  - CONTEXT: Several studies have shown that the kinematics of the scapula is altered in many disorders that affect the shoulder. Description of scapular motion in the chest continues to be a scientific and clinical challenge. OBJECTIVE: To check the validity and reliability of a new, minimally invasive method of tracking the internal and external rotation of the scapula using ultrasound imaging combined with the signal provided by a 3-dimensional electromagnetic sensor. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study with a repeated-measures descriptive test-retest design was employed to evaluate this new tracking method. The new method was validated in vitro and the reliability of data over repeated measures between scapula positions was calculated in vivo. SETTING: University laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 30 healthy men and women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The validation of the scapula rotation tracking using the in vitro model was calculated by Pearson correlation test between a 2-dimensional cross-correlation algorithm of the new method and another software image. The reliability of the tracking of the scapula rotation was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: In the validation in vitro, the correlation of rotations obtained by the 2 methods was good (r = .77, P = .01). The reliability in vivo had excellent results (intraclass correlation coefficient = .88; 95% confidence interval, .82-.93) in the test-retest analysis of 8 measures. The intrarater analysis of variance test showed no significant differences between the measures (P = .85, F = 0.46). CONCLUSION: Ultrasound imaging combined with a motion sensor to track the scapula has been shown to be a reliable and valid method for measuring internal and external rotation during separation of the upper limb.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate test and retest reliability according to examiner experience with the three-dimensional kinematics of the trunk, scapula, and arm segments during flexion and unilateral abduction of the arm. Ten men and 10 women (mean age, 25.1 [1.1] years) participated in this study. Each volunteer participated in six test sessions, four on the first day (two for each examiner) and two on the second day (one for each examiner). A 48-h interval was given between test days. The assessments were made by one examiner with movement analysis experience and a second examiner without experience. For each session (intra-day), the volunteers performed five repetitions of unilateral arm flexions and abductions using their dominant arms. After 1â¯h, the data were re-collected and all markers were replaced. Data from the trunk, scapula, and arm were analysed at 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120° of arm flexion and abduction using intraclass coefficient correlation, standard error of the measurement, and analysis of variance. The results did not differ between the experienced and inexperienced examiners except for trunk axial rotation at all studied angles and for arm rotation at 120° of abduction. The examiner previously trained in movement analysis marker placement demonstrated the same intra-tester reliability as the inexperienced tester when marker placement accuracy was the variable of interest.

AB  - Purpose: Altered three-dimensional (3D) joint kinematics can contribute to shoulder pathology, including post-stroke shoulder pain. Reliable assessment methods enable comparative studies between asymptomatic shoulders of healthy subjects and painful shoulders of post-stroke subjects, and could inform treatment planning for post-stroke shoulder pain. The study purpose was to establish intra-rater test-retest reliability and within-subject repeatability of a palpation/digitization protocol, which assesses 3D clavicular/scapular/humeral rotations, in asymptomatic and painful post-stroke shoulders. Methods: Repeated measurements of 3D clavicular/scapular/humeral joint/segment rotations were obtained using palpation/digitization in 32 asymptomatic and six painful post-stroke shoulders during four reaching postures (rest/flexion/abduction/external rotation). Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs), standard error of the measurement and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: All ICC values indicated high to very high test-retest reliability (&#8805;0.70), with lower reliability for scapular anterior/posterior tilt during external rotation in asymptomatic subjects, and scapular medial/lateral rotation, humeral horizontal abduction/adduction and axial rotation during abduction in post-stroke subjects. All standard error of measurement values demonstrated within-subject repeatability error &#8804;5° for all clavicular/scapular/humeral joint/segment rotations (asymptomatic &#8804;3.75°; post-stroke &#8804;5.0°), except for humeral axial rotation (asymptomatic &#8804;5°; post-stroke &#8804;15°). Conclusions: This noninvasive, clinically feasible palpation/digitization protocol was reliable and repeatable in asymptomatic shoulders, and in a smaller sample of painful post-stroke shoulders. Implications for Rehabilitation In the clinical setting, a reliable and repeatable noninvasive method for assessment of three-dimensional (3D) clavicular/scapular/humeral joint orientation and range of motion (ROM) is currently required. The established reliability and repeatability of this proposed palpation/digitization protocol will enable comparative 3D ROM studies between asymptomatic and post-stroke shoulders, which will further inform treatment planning. Intra-rater test-retest repeatability, which is measured by the standard error of the measure, indicates the range of error associated with a single test measure. Therefore, clinicians can use the standard error of the measure to determine the "true" differences between pre-treatment and post-treatment test scores.

AB  - Clinical Scenario: Assessing movement of the scapula is an important component in the evaluation and treatment of the shoulder complex. Currently, gold-standard methods to quantify scapular movement include invasive technique, radiation, and 3D motion systems. This critically appraised topic focuses on several clinical assessment methods of quantifying scapular upward rotation with respect to their reliability and clinical utility. Clinical Question: Is there evidence for noninvasive methods that reliably assess clinical measures of scapular upward rotation in subjects with or without shoulder pathologies? Summary of Key Findings: Four studies were selected to be critically appraised. The quality appraisal of diagnostic reliability checklist was used to score the articles on methodology and consistency. Three of the 4 studies demonstrated support for the clinical question. Clinical Bottom Line: There is moderate evidence to support reliable clinical methods for measuring scapular upward rotation in subjects with or without shoulder pathology. Strength of Recommendation: There is moderate evidence to suggest there are reliable clinical measures to quantify scapular upward rotation in patients with or without shoulder pathology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Handheld dynamometers (HHD) provide quick and low-cost assessments of muscle strength and their use has been increasing in clinical practice. There is no available data related to the validity of HHD for this measurement. OBJECTIVE: To verify the concurrent validity of scapular protraction measurements using an HHD. METHODS: Individuals with traumatic anterior glenohumeral instability were allocated in Instability Group (n=20), healthy swimmers were allocated in Athletes Group (n=19) and healthy subjects were allocated in Sedentary Group (n=21). Concurrent validity was verified by the Pearson correlation test between HHD and isokinetic measurements. The agreement between instruments was verified by Bland-Altman plots, for each of the two HHD positions. RESULTS: A moderate correlation was observed between seated (r=0.59) and lying supine HHD (r=0.54) and isokinetic dynamometer measurements for the all groups. Separated group analysis exhibited a strong correlation between seated HHD and isokinetic dynamometer measurements in the Instability Group (r=0.80), Sedentary Group (r=0.79) and Athletes Group (r=0.76). The Bland-Altman plot showed greater agreement in the seated position than the lying supine position when comparing measurements with the HHD and isokinetic in both the general sample and separated groups. CONCLUSION: The HHD may be considered a valid tool for assessing scapular protraction muscle strength among healthy athletes, non-athletes and subjects with shoulder instability. We recommend to assess subjects in the seated position and to be aware that the HHD tends to overestimate the peak force, compared with the gold-standard isokinetic dynamometer.

AB  - Patient-specific biomechanical simulations of joints require accurate reconstruction of bony anatomy from medical image data. The articular geometries of the joints may influence their biomechanics. Statistical shape models (SSMs) have become ubiquitous in the literature and aim to capture the natural variation of biological objects. They work by learning the variation from training examples to define the space of valid biological shapes. However, the kinematic information descriptive of the anato-physiological relationship of two interacting objects is not generally encoded in the SSM. Here, we propose a framework for developing combined statistical shape and kinematics models (SSKMs) as Gaussian process morphable models to analyse the shape and kinematics relationship. We demonstrate the framework on a three-dimensional (3D) image data set consisting of ten right-handed cadaveric shoulder joints acquired using computed tomography. Additionally, we simulate specific bone motions to encode kinematics in the combined model. Our SSKM built from shoulder data (matching scapulae and humeri) correctly depicts a correlation between the shape and kinematics as hypothesized. We furthermore demonstrate the ability to marginalize from the SSKM to obtain shape-only variation and kinematics-only variation. Future work aims to use the SSKM framework to understand the relationships between kinematics and shape for various joints as well as to develop patient-specific computational models to evaluate joint biomechanics.

AB  - The conventional acromion marker cluster (AMC) method used to estimate scapular orientation cannot adequately represent complex shoulder movements due to soft tissue artifacts. The regression method may have nonlinear error changes depending on humeral elevation angle and elevation plane. Therefore, we aimed to develop a new method of estimating scapular orientation using curved surface interpolation during various shoulder movements, and to compare its accuracy with conventional and regression methods. Thirteen healthy men were recruited. AMC and refractive markers for bony landmarks were placed on the skin. During the preprocess, several shoulder postures, including different arm elevations and elevation planes, were measured using the motion capture system. Premeasured data were used to calibrate the positional relationship between AMC and scapula using curved surface interpolation. Subsequently, scapular orientations were estimated by measuring AMC and body markers of any shoulder posture. To evaluate the accuracy of our methods, 25 elevation postures and six tasks involving postures common to activities of daily living were applied. For tasks requiring greater arm elevation angles, the root mean square error was less in our method than in the conventional and regression methods. Therefore, our method could improve the accuracy of estimating scapular orientation in various elevation postures.

AB  - A thorough physical examination of the shoulder and cervical spine is critical in establishing a focused differential diagnosis of the pathology in and around the shoulder joint. Numerous tests have been described in the literature to help improve the diagnostic accuracy of specific shoulder or cervical spine pathology. A comprehensive approach for the physical examination of the cervical spine, scapula, and rotator cuff is presented and descriptions on how the tests are performed and the evidence behind why specific tests are used in enabling improved diagnosis of shoulder pathology are discussed.

AB  - Biplane 2D-3D registration approaches have been used for measuring 3D, in vivo glenohumeral (GH) joint kinematics. Computed tomography (CT) has become the gold standard for reconstructing 3D bone models, as it provides high geometric accuracy and similar tissue contrast to video-radiography. Alternatively, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would not expose subjects to radiation and provides the ability to add cartilage and other soft tissues to the models. However, the accuracy of MRI-based 2D-3D registration for quantifying glenohumeral kinematics is unknown. We developed an automatic 2D-3D registration program that works with both CT- and MRI-based image volumes for quantifying joint motions. The purpose of this study was to use the proposed 2D-3D auto-registration algorithm to describe the humerus and scapula tracking accuracy of CT- and MRI-based registration relative to radiostereometric analysis (RSA) during dynamic biplanar video-radiography. The GH kinematic accuracy (RMS error) was 0.6-1.0â¯mm and 0.6-2.2° for the CT-based registration and 1.4-2.2â¯mm and 1.2-2.6° for MRI-based registration. Higher kinematic accuracy of CT-based registration was expected as MRI provides lower spatial resolution and bone contrast as compared to CT and suffers from spatial distortions. However, the MRI-based registration is within an acceptable accuracy for many clinical research questions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Shoulder pain is the most common complaint for wheelchair athletes. Scapular orientation and dyskinesia are thought to be associated with shoulder pathology, yet no previous studies have examined the bilateral scapula kinematics of wheelchair athletes during propulsion. RESEARCH QUESTION: To examine bilateral scapular kinematics of highly trained wheelchair rugby (WR) players and any associations with self-reported shoulder pain during everyday wheelchair propulsion. METHODS: Ten WR players (5 with shoulder pain, 5 without) performed 2 × 3-minute bouts of exercise in their everyday wheelchair on a wheelchair ergometer at two sub-maximal speeds (3 and 6 km h-1). During the final minute, 3D kinematic data were collected at 100 Hz to describe scapulothoracic motion relative to each propulsion cycle. Instantaneous asymmetries in scapular orientation between dominant and non-dominant sides were also reported. Differences in scapular kinematics and propulsion asymmetries were compared across shoulders symptomatic and asymptomatic of pain. RESULTS: An internally rotated, upwardly rotated and anteriorly tilted scapula was common during wheelchair propulsion and asymmetries &#8804;14° did exist, yet minimal changes were observed across speeds. Participants with bilateral shoulder pain displayed a less upwardly rotated scapula during propulsion, however large inter-individual variability in scapular kinematics was noted. SIGNIFICANCE: Scapular asymmetries are exhibited by wheelchair athletes during wheelchair propulsion, yet these were not exacerbated by increased speed and had limited associations to shoulder pain. This suggests that propulsion kinematics of highly trained athletes may not be the primary cause of pain experienced by this population.

AB  - Scapula dyskinesis is prevalent in athletes conducting forceful overhead movements. This review summarizes our current understanding of the condition and evaluates the different options for assessing dyskinesis. Current methods for assessing scapula dyskinesis involve clinical observations, three-dimensional kinematics and three-dimensional wing computer tomography. Clinical observation is the most pragmatic method for assessing dyskinesis yielding inter-rater agreement of 79% and sensitivity of 76%. Similar sensitivities have been recorded using three-dimensional kinematics. Three-dimensional wing computer tomography has yielded a near-perfect interclass correlation coefficient of 0.972 when used to assess dyskinesis. Three-dimensional wing computer tomography, given its expense, low availability, and levels of irradiation, should be reserved for high-performance athletes where detailed assessments need to be made to aid rehabilitation. Observational assessments should remain the main modality used for general assessment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowing the reliability of three-dimensional motion analysis to evaluate scapular kinematics during upper limb movements is essential to plan further research dedicated to understanding scapulothoracic joint movements relative to the global shoulder motion. RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim of this study was to assess the intra-subject as well as intra- and interrater reliability of scapulothoracic joint angles during shoulder elevation in scapular plane and shoulder flexion. METHODS: Twenty healthy participants (26.6 ± 3.5 years) were asked to perform maximum shoulder elevation in scapular plane as well as shoulder flexion. Reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and its 95% confidence interval of scapular kinematics (rotation, tilting, pro-retraction) at each degree of global motion (shoulder elevation or shoulder flexion) between 0° to 150°. RESULTS: ICCs above 0.60 were accepted as good indicators for reliability. Intra-subject reliability was found to be very high (>0.9 for most part) for all scapulothoracic joint angles during both movements. Intra- and interrater reliability also showed good reliability being above 0.60 for the most part (except scapula tilting during shoulder elevation). Scapular kinematics showed low reliability during the respective first 10° and 20° of shoulder elevation and shoulder flexion. Furthermore, decreasing reliability was found above 120° of shoulder elevation or flexion. SIGNIFICANCE: This study generally showed good to high levels of reliability in the range of interest (20-120°) in evaluating scapula kinematics in healthy adults during shoulder elevation and flexion; these results are important for future research providing a better understanding of scapular kinematics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Morphologic variations of the scapula and acromion have been found to be associated with shoulder pathology. This study used statistical shape modelling to quantify these variations in healthy shoulders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A statistical shape model of the scapula was created using 3-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions of 108 survey-confirmed nonpathologic shoulders of 54 patients. The mean shape and the 95% confidence interval were calculated and analyzed in the first 5 shape modes. RESULTS: The first 5 shape modes consisted of consecutively sized (72% of total variation), rotation of the coracoacromial complex (5%), acromial shape and slope (4%), shape of the scapular spine (2%), and acromial overhang (2%). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In healthy shoulders, a certain variation in rotation of the coracoacromial complex and in acromial shape and slope was observed. These new parameters might be correlated with shoulder pathology such as glenohumeral osteoarthritis or rotator cuff tears.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA) anatomical, reverse or both is an increasingly popular procedure but the glenoid component is still a weak element, accounting for 30-50% of mechanical complications and contributing to the revision burden. Component mal-positioning is one of the main aetiological factors in glenoid failure and thus Patient-Specific Instrumentation (PSI) has been introduced in an effort to optimise implant placement. The aim of this systematic literature review and meta-analysis is to compare the success of PSI and Standard Instrumentation (STDI) methods in reproducing pre-operative surgical planning of glenoid component positioning. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A search (restricted to English language) was conducted in November 2017 on MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov. Using the search terms "Patient-Specific Instrumentation (PSI)", "custom guide", "shoulder", "glenoid" and "arthroplasty", 42 studies were identified. The main exclusion criteria were: no CT-scan analysis results; studies done on plastic bone; and use of a reusable or generic guide. Eligible studies evaluated final deviations from the planning for version, inclination, entry point and rotation. Reviewers worked independently to extract data and assess the risk of bias on the same studies. RESULTS: The final analysis included 12 studies, comprising 227 participants (seven studies on 103 humans and five studies on 124 cadaveric specimens). Heterogeneity was moderate or high for all parameters. Deviations from the pre-operative planning for version (p<0.01), inclination (p<0.01) and entry point (p = 0.02) were significantly lower with the PSI than with the STDI, but not for rotation (p = 0.49). Accuracy (deviation from planning) with PSI was about 1.88° to 4.96°, depending on the parameter. The number of component outliers (>10° of deviation or 4mm) were significantly higher with STDI than with PSI (68.6% vs 15.3% (p = 0.01)). CONCLUSION: This review supports the idea that PSI enhances glenoid component positioning, especially a decrease in the number of outliers. However, the findings are not definitive and further validation is required. It should be noted that no randomised clinical studies are available to confirm long-term outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acromioclavicular (AC) joint (ACJ) pathology is a common cause of shoulder dysfunction, and treatment recommendations vary. When the efficacy of treatment is evaluated, the ability to measure outcomes specific to the population is essential. The aim of the current research was to develop and validate a specific ACJ questionnaire. METHODS: Items for the "Specific AC Score" (SACS) were generated through the use of an expert panel, existing questionnaires, and patient feedback. Preliminary data analysis identified redundancy of items resulting in the questionnaire being refined. The final SACS was evaluated in 125 patients requiring surgical intervention of the ACJ. Internal consistency (the Cronbach &#945; and corrected item-total correlation), content validity, criterion validity, responsiveness, and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient) were examined and compared with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index, Oxford Shoulder Score, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form. The minimum detectable change score was calculated. RESULTS: The Cronbach &#945; for the total scale preoperatively and postoperatively was high (preoperatively = 0.91, postoperatively = 0.93). All 3 domains (Pain, Function, Quality of Life) demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (&#945; > 0.70), and the correlation between items in each domain was satisfactory. The responsiveness was excellent (effect size, -2.32; standard response mean, -1.85) and was higher than the other general shoulder questionnaires. There were no relevant floor or ceiling effects. Reliability was high (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.89) and the minimum detectable change was 6.5 points. DISCUSSION: This new ACJ-specific questionnaire has been robustly developed, has good measurement properties, and has excellent responsiveness. The SACS is recommended for measuring outcomes in ACJ patients.

AB  - CONTEXT:   Performing shoulder-abduction exercises with scapular retraction has been theorized to reduce the potential for shoulder impingement. However, objective data to support this premise are lacking. OBJECTIVE:   To evaluate the influence of active scapular retraction on acromiohumeral distance (AHD) at 4 shoulder-abduction angles using real-time ultrasound. DESIGN:   Cross-sectional study. SETTING:   University laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS:   Twenty asymptomatic individuals (10 men, 10 women; age = 22.9 ± 2.8 years, height = 169.3 ± 9.5 cm, mass = 65.5 ± 12.9 kg) were recruited. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S):   Real-time ultrasound images of AHD were obtained during nonretracted and retracted scapular conditions at 0°, 45°, 60°, and 90° of shoulder abduction. A 2-factor analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to evaluate the influence of shoulder retraction on AHD across shoulder-abduction angles. RESULTS:   A scapular-retraction condition × shoulder-abduction-angle interaction for AHD was found ( F3,57 = 4.56, P = .006). The AHD was smaller at 0° (10.5 versus 11.2 mm, respectively; t19 = 2.22, P = .04) but larger at 90° (9.4 versus 8.7 mm, respectively; t19 = -2.30, P = .04) of shoulder abduction during the retracted than the nonretracted condition. No differences in AHD were observed between conditions at 45° ( t19 = 1.45, P = .16) and 60° ( t19 = 1.17, P = .86) of abduction. CONCLUSIONS:   The observed differences in AHD at 0° and 90° of shoulder abduction were small and did not exceed the established minimal detectable change for either angle. Our findings suggest that active scapular retraction during shoulder abduction has a minimal influence on AHD at 0° and 90° in healthy individuals. Further investigations are needed to determine whether scapular retraction influences AHD in individuals with subacromial impingement.

AB  - This study aims to validate model-based radiostereometric analysis (RSA) on the glenoid component of reversed total shoulder arthroplasty. We compared two different modalities of model-based RSA, elementary geometrical shapes and reversed engineering. We also explored two different ways to position the patient to obtain different projections of the implant, the hip-position (transversal) and shoulder-position (sagittal). Phantom accuracy was determined by performing nine translations (x, y, z) and five rotations (x, y, z), and expressed as the mean difference between RSA measurements and micrometer values. Precision was measured using 12 double examinations of the phantom and 19 in patients, and expressed as1.96 × standard deviations of the paired differences between double examinations. The accuracy was high for both modalities, but rotation around the symmetrical axis of the implant could not be measured using reversed engineering. Clinical precision ranged from 0.13 to 0.25 mm for translations, and 0.4° to 0.7° for rotations, using reversed engineering. For elementary geometrical shapes, the precision ranged from 0.18 to 0.34 mm for translations, and 0.8° to 1.8° for rotations. The hip-position was abandoned due to poor implant visualization. Model-based RSA on the glenoid component of reversed total shoulder arthroplasty has a high precision and accuracy, comparable to RSA results on hips and knees. Patient positioning is vital for obtaining adequate results. We found that reversed engineering was the more reliable method, and recommend reversed engineering as the method of choice for further clinical RSA investigation of the glenoid component of reversed total shoulder arthroplasty. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the intra- and interrater reliability and agreement for field-based assessment of scapular control, shoulder range of motion (ROM), and shoulder isometric strength in elite youth athletes. DESIGN: Test-retest reliability and agreement study. SETTING: Eight blinded raters (two for each assessment) assessed players on field during two testing sessions separated by one week. PARTICIPANTS: 162 elite youth handball players with or without a history of previous shoulder pain within the preceding six months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Kappa (&#954;) and prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) coefficients for scapular control reliability, and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) for ROM and strength agreement. RESULTS: Scapular control demonstrated substantial to almost perfect reliability (&#954; 0.67 to 0.84, PABAK from 0.68 to 0.88). Mean strength values ranged from 0.9â¯N/kg to 1.6â¯N/kg, and LOAs ranged from -0.7â¯N/kg to 0.8â¯N/kg. Rotational strength revealed additionally systematic bias between and within rater. No or acceptable systematic bias were evident for ROM and abduction strength measures. Mean values and LOAs for ROM ranged between 39.9° to 52.3°, and from -12.6° to 9.9°, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Scapular control and ROM can be assessed on the field with acceptable reliability. The threshold for reliable measurements of isometric strength using handheld-dynamometers is high.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative assessment of rotator cuff muscle activity is important in the treatment of shoulder disorders. However, the known methods for assessing rotator cuff muscle activity thus far have been inaccurate, invasive, and inconvenient. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does the activity of the deltoid, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles measured using ultrasound shear wave elastography have a linear correlation with muscle activity assessed using generally used methods, including isokinetic dynamometry and electromyography? (2) Does the activity of the deltoid, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles measured using shear wave elastography show good intraobserver and interobserver reliability? METHODS: Twelve volunteers participated in intrasession reliability experiments. They were asked to perform isometric abduction, external rotation, and scaption contractions (defined as elevation of the arm within the plane of the scapula with neutral arm rotation) gradually increased from 0% to 75% of maximal voluntary contraction. The joint torque, electromyographic activity, and shear elastic modulus were synchronously measured in the middeltoid, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles. The validity of the elastic modulus value was assessed using regression analysis between normalized torque and electromyographic root mean square values. For intraobserver and interobserver reliability measurements, repeated experiments were performed with the same protocol. RESULTS: The shear elastic modulus and normalized joint torque with isokinetic dynamometry showed a linear relationship in all muscles (deltoid, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus) and each of the ultrasonography planes (longitudinal and transverse) (mean R > 0.8 and p < 0.001 for all measurements). For the supraspinatus muscle, the mean slope of the relationship between shear elastic modulus in the longitudinal plane and the normalized joint torque during scaption contraction was 1.28 ± 0.39 kPa/%MVC (mean R = 0.93 ± 0.21, p < 0.001). Furthermore, similar results were obtained in relation to electromyography root mean square values (mean R > 0.8 and p < 0.001 in all measurements). For the supraspinatus muscle, the mean slope of the relationship between shear elastic modulus in the longitudinal plane and electromyographic (EMG) root mean square was 0.96 ± 0.27 kPa/%EMG (mean R = 0.91 ± 0.08, p < 0.001). The intraobserver and interobserver reliabilities were excellent in all positions (abduction, external rotation, and scaption) and in both the longitudinal and transverse ultrasonography planes (all intraclass correlation coefficients are > 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: Shoulder muscle activity can be noninvasively evaluated with ultrasound shear wave elastography. Clinician and scientists should consider the application of this technique in cases in which evaluation of shoulder muscle activity is required. The next step after this study will be to check the shear elastic modulus of rotator cuff muscle in patients with rotator cuff tear. We plan to evaluate the correlation between shear elastic modulus and joint torque according to tear size and fatty infiltration status of rotator cuff muscle. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Shear wave electrography can be used to measure various tissue elasticities in both static and dynamic modes. It may be a useful tool to evaluate pre- and postoperative rotator cuff muscle activity in a relatively simple manner. Shoulder function after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty associated with deltoid muscle activity also may be evaluated. Changes in tissue tightness in shoulder disorders caused by increase soft tissue stiffness (ie, adhesive capsulitis and glenohumeral internal rotation deficit) can be evaluated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Successful treatment of shoulder disease requires an accurate diagnosis. In addition to differentiated history taking, clinical examination is the most important component in the diagnosis of shoulder diseases. METHOD: The present video explains the common provocation tests and functional tests that are used in the basic clinical examination of the shoulder. In addition to general inspection and palpation, the focus is on different diagnostic tests and clinical signs that improve diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSION: The present basic clinical examination methods allow a structured approach to clinical issues and can be a good basis, if supplemented by further specific and individual tests.

AB  - Scapular kinematics during sports performances can be recorded using skin-mounted trackers attached to the skin overlying the acromion for continuous data collection without restricting natural motions of the subject relative to medical imaging analyses limiting its use for wide-range or high-speed motions. This study aimed to describe the existence of a directional bias in the translational and rotational errors of skin-mounted trackers using a 3D magnetic resonance imaging (3D-MRI) protocol. 3D-MRI scans of the healthy right shoulders of 19 males were acquired in 12 arm positions. The relative transformation of the scapular configuration determined to be the measurement error, as recorded by the configuration of the small cuboid imitating a skin-mounted tracker relative to the actual scapular configuration measured by the voxel-based registration. These measurement errors were expressed with either positive or negative values to describe the bias. Overall translational errors in the lateral, anterior, and superior directions were 3.7â¯±â¯8.4â¯mm, 9.5â¯±â¯6.4â¯mm, and 6.2â¯±â¯4.6â¯mm, respectively. Overall rotational errors in protraction, upward rotation, and posterior tilt were 7.8â¯±â¯8.4°, 0.2â¯±â¯7.4°, andâ¯-â¯4.0â¯±â¯7.5°, respectively. The skin-mounted tracker displayed a high probability of displacement in antero-superior (93% and 91%) directions and rotates in a protracting manner (82%) relative to the position of the underlying bone with the gradual nature of its change. The existence of the directional bias with its gradual change suggests a statistical predictability in measurement errors, which can be used to predict accurate scapular translation and rotation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Various protocols exist for magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA) of the shoulder, including 3D isotropic scanning and positioning in neutral (2D neutral MRA), or abduction-external-rotation (ABER). HYPOTHESIS: MRA does not improve diagnostic accuracy for labral tears when compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed using 3-Tesla (3T) magnets. METHOD: Systematic review of the Cochrane, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases according to PRISMA guidelines. Included studies compared 3T MRI or 3T MRA (index tests) to arthroscopic findings (reference test). Methodological appraisal performed using QUADAS-2. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated. RESULTS: Ten studies including 929 patients were included. Index test bias and applicability were a concern in the majority of studies. The use of arthroscopy as the reference test raised concern of verification bias in all studies. For anterior labral lesions, 3T MRI was less sensitive (0.83 vs. 0.87 p = 0.083) than 3T 2D neutral MRA. Compared to 3T 2D neutral MRA, both 3T 3D Isotropic MRA and 3T ABER MRA significantly improved sensitivity (0.87 vs. 0.95 vs. 0.94). For SLAP lesions, 3T 2D neutral MRA was of similar sensitivity to 3T MRI (0.84 vs. 0.83, p = 0.575), but less specific (0.99 vs. 0.92 p < 0.0001). For posterior labral lesions, 3T 2D neutral MRA had greater sensitivity than 3T 3D Isotropic MRA and 3T MRI (0.90 vs. 0.83 vs. 0.83). CONCLUSIONS: At 3-T, MRA improved sensitivity for diagnosis of anterior and posterior labral lesions, but reduced specificity in diagnosis of SLAP tears. 3T MRA with ABER positioning further improved sensitivity in diagnosis of anterior labral tears. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.

AB  - Model-based tracking, using CT and biplane fluoroscopy, allows highly accurate quantification of glenohumeral motion and changes in the subacromial space. Previous investigators have used custom-built biplane fluoroscopes designed specifically for kinematic applications, which are available at few institutions and require FDA approval prior to clinical use. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the utility of an off-the-shelf clinical biplane fluoroscope for kinematic applications by validating model-based tracking for measurement of glenohumeral motion using an unmodified clinical system. Biplane images of each shoulder of a cadaver torso were acquired at various joint positions and during simulated movements along anatomical planes of motion. The pose of each humerus and scapula was determined using model-based tracking and compared to a bead-based gold standard. Error due to a temporal-offset between corresponding biplane images, characteristic of clinical biplane systems, was determined by comparison of measured and known relative position of 2 bead clusters of a phantom that was imaged while moved throughout the fluoroscopy image volume. Model-based tracking had global kinematic mean absolute errors of 0.27â¯mm and 0.29° (static), and 0.22-0.32â¯mm and 0.12-0.45° (dynamic). Glenohumeral mean absolute errors were 0.39â¯mm and 0.45° (static), and 0.36-0.42â¯mm and 0.41-0.48° (dynamic). The temporal-offset was predicted to add errors of 0.06-0.85â¯mm and 0.05-0.28° for cadaveric trials for the speeds examined. For defined speeds, sub-millimeter and sub-degree kinematic accuracy and precision were achieved using an unmodified clinical biplane fluoroscope for quantification of glenohumeral motion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of scapular dyskinesis is of clinical interest because it is believed to be associated with pathologies of the shoulder. This study investigated the feasibility of plain-film radiography in evaluating scapular dyskinesis. METHODS: Subjects with unilateral disorders of the shoulder (n = 186) who underwent plain-film radiography of bilateral scapulae were divided into 4 categories of scapular dyskinesis patterns according to the Kibler classification and analyzed. Coracoid upward shift distance (CUSD), length of the scapular spine line (LSS), and scapular upward rotation angle (SURA) were measured on the radiographs. Intrarater and inter-rater reliability were tested, and the characteristics of these parameters in each type were analyzed. The differences (d) between bilateral scapulae (d-CUSD, d-LSS, and d-SURA) among the 4 categories were compared. RESULTS: Intrarater and inter-rater reliability were excellent for all parameters. Significant differences between the scapulae were observed in CUSD in type I and in LSS in type II categories. No significant difference in any of the parameters was found in type III. Compared with the other categories, d-CUSD in type I and d-LSS in type II were significantly larger. The cutoff values of d-CUSD and d-LSS were 1.1 mm and 1.2 mm, respectively. No significant difference in d-SURA was found among the 4 categories. CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of CUSD, LSS, and SURA on plain-film radiography had excellent reliability. d-CUSD and d-LSS were characteristic parameters of type I and type II, respectively; however, type III had no distinguishing characteristics among the parameters.

AB  - CONTEXT: Scapular proprioception is a key concern in managing shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS). However, no study has examined the effect of elastic taping on scapular proprioception performance. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immediate effect of kinesiology taping (KT) on scapular reposition accuracy, kinematics, and muscle activation in individuals with SIS. DESIGN: Randomized controlled study. SETTING: Musculoskeletal laboratory, National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty overhead athletes with SIS. INTERVENTIONS: KT or placebo taping over the upper and lower trapezius muscles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were scapular joint position sense, measured as the reposition errors, in the direction of scapular elevation and protraction. The secondary outcomes were scapular kinematics and muscle activity of the upper trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior during arm elevation in the scapular plane (scaption). RESULTS: Compared with placebo taping, KT significantly decreased the reposition errors of upward/downward rotation (P = .04) and anterior/posterior tilt (P = .04) during scapular protraction. KT also improved scapular kinematics (significant group by taping effect for posterior tilt, P = .03) during scaption. Kinesiology and placebo tapings had a similar effect on upper trapezius muscle activation (significant taping effect, P = .003) during scaption. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified the positive effects of KT on scapular joint position sense and movement control. Future studies with a longer period of follow-up and clinical measurement might help to clarify the clinical effect and mechanisms of elastic taping in individuals with SIS.

AB  - For kinematic studies of the shoulder, electromagnetic sensors are commonly placed on the humerus, scapula, and trunk. The trunk sensor is used to describe humeral and scapular kinematics with respect to the trunk. There are two common trunk sensor placements, the sternum or third thoracic vertebrae (T3). It is currently unclear if placement of the trunk sensor affects kinematics, making it difficult to compare data across studies. The purpose of this study was to compare two trunk sensor placements (T3 and sternum) on trunk and scapular kinematics during arm elevation. An electromagnetic tracking system was used to collect kinematic data during five consecutive repetitions of ascending and descending arm elevation in the sagittal plane. The results indicate that trunk sensor placement had no significant effect on trunk kinematics or scapular upward/downward rotation and internal/external rotation. Scapular anterior/posterior tilt was significantly greater when the trunk sensor was on the sternum compared to the T3 vertebrae during ascending 30°-120°: mean differenceâ¯=â¯-3.51° (95%CI: -5.61, -1.40), and descending 120°-30°: mean differenceâ¯=â¯-3.27° (95%CI: -6.07, -0.48). However, the difference in anterior/posterior tilt did not exceed the error (minimal detectable change), and thus is likely not a meaningful difference. These results indicate the trunk sensors can be affixed on T3 or the sternum, depending on the needs of the study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing number of parameters measured on anteroposterior radiographs are used for the evaluation of the bony geometry of the scapula. Inhomogeneous acquisition of images is common because of the lack of standardization in radiographic positioning. Images with malrotation around the horizontal axis of the scapula are particularly frequent. We hypothesized that malrotated images would result in large variations in measured radiographic parameters and that image standardization using qualitative and semiquantitative "omometric" criteria would decrease these variations in measurements. "Omometry" is a newly introduced umbrella term that contains all standardized measurements on plain radiographs of the shoulder, analogous to the term "coxometry," which is widely used for the radiographic assessment of the osseous pelvis and hip. METHODS: In this experimental, cadaveric radiographic study, 7 dry-bone human scapula cadaveric specimens from anonymous donors were used to obtain 210 radiographs. We incrementally rotated (steps of 3°) every scapula around its horizontal and vertical axis, with a total range of 42° per each axis. Then, we measured 5 radiographic parameters on every image and observed their change with malrotation. Furthermore, we introduced 4 omometric criteria defining an appropriate (presence of &#8805;3 criteria) radiographic image to improve standardization of scapular image acquisition. RESULTS: Overall, measured values remained stable within a narrow range of ±9° of malrotation. Beyond this range, values of all parameters significantly deviated (>±2°) from the initial value. Measurements on appropriate images were significantly less prone to deviation. Within the appropriate images, those with 4 criteria showed a higher specificity than those with 3 criteria. CONCLUSION: There is significant variation in values of measured radiographic parameters on anteroposterior radiographs of the scapula with substantially malrotated images. With the use of the 4 newly introduced semiquantitative and qualitative omometric criteria, which define an appropriate image, reliability of the measured parameters can be significantly improved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess concurrent validity, between and within-day reliability of scapular and clavicular digital inclinometer measures. DESIGN: Test-retest and concurrent validity. SETTING: Laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three participants with and without shoulder symptoms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Static positions of scapular upward rotation, anterior/posterior tilting and clavicular elevation were measured between days with an inclinometer and compared to a 3-dimensional electromagnetic tracking system in different positions of sagittal plane humeral elevation (neutral, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°). The two methods were compared using a two-way Analysis of Variance. Linear regressions at each arm position were also performed to further assess concurrent validity. RESULTS: Between-day reliability demonstrated Intraclass Correlation Coefficients &#8805; 0.50 for all comparisons. There were statistically significant differences between methods or interactions of method and arm position for clavicle elevation (p = 0.004, maximum offset between methods 7.7º in the neutral position), and scapular upward rotation (p = 0.001). For scapular upward rotation, the maximum difference between methods was less than 2° across all humeral positions. Clavicle elevation (r = 0.67-0.82) and scapular upward rotation (r = 0.57-0.81) demonstrated higher correlations between measurement methods than scapular anterior/posterior tilt (r = 0.10-0.67). CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent validity in assessing scapular upward rotation and clavicle elevation with an inclinometer was shown when compared with electromagnetic tracking. However, the inclinometer method may not have adequate concurrent validity to clinically measure scapular anterior/posterior tilting.

AB  - Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty (RSA) has gained popularity over the recent years, but impingement concerns are still present. Surgeons aim to correct pre-operative glenoid deformities to reduce impingement but it can be challenging without assistance like patient specific guides. However, it is unclear how accurate glenoid correction affects the impingement. The main objective of this study was to determine whether accurate glenoid correction to neutral version and tilt can reduce the risk of impingement. Two types of virtual surgeries were performed on 22 pre-operative arthritic shoulders: (i) "Interactive," the glenoid baseplate could be placed with accuracy, and (ii) "Blind," surgeons placed the RSA baseplate while they could only visualize the glenoid. The virtual models were then used in an RSA biomechanical model which recorded impingement for (i) four Range of Motion (ROM) tasks, (ii) ten Activities of Daily Living (ADL). The "Blind" method resulted in more variable glenoid placement (version and tilt) than the "Interactive" method (p = 0.001). However, both methods showed similar ROM and impingement occurrence in ADLs. The results suggest it is challenging for surgeons to accurately correct version and tilt on arthritic glenoids when only referencing off of the face of the glenoid. However, the variable glenosphere placement observed in the "Blind" method did not result in worse impingement compared to the accurate "Interactive" method. This was because both methods had similar inferior baseplate positioning which is more important than correcting version or tilt. Implantation accuracy remains important in RSA, but pre-operative planning should not just target at correcting version and tilt. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing stiffness in the upper trapezius muscle may contribute to imbalance of scapular motion, and result in shoulder and neck discomfort during shoulder flexion. Therefore, it is essential to quantify upper trapezius stiffness in various shoulder positions in order to aid in the prevention of these disorders and to optimize rehabilitation. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present study were to examine the intra and inter-tester reliability of MyotonPRO device in measuring upper trapezius stiffness and its ability to determine changes in stiffness during shoulder flexion. METHODS: Twenty healthy male subjects (mean age: 28.3±4.8 years) were studied. The stiffness of upper trapezius was quantified using the MyotonPRO device. RESULTS: The results revealed excellent intra and inter-tester reliability for measuring upper trapezius stiffness with the shoulder in a neutral position, and also found a 14.2% increase in stiffness upon shoulder flexion between 0° and 60° of flexion. Minimal detectable change (MDC) was 26.3â¯N/m. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that MyotonPRO device is a feasible tool to quantify upper trapezius stiffness as well as changes in muscle stiffness. Thus, it is important to assess the changes in upper trapezius muscle stiffness due to pathology or treatments for future studies.

AB  - There is no agreement within literature regarding management of scapula fractures. Our aim was to carry out a systematic review of literature on management of the scapular fractures. Our search across multiple medical databases for studies on the scapular fractures until February 2014 yielded 32 studies. We have excluded case series <7 patients, case reports, review articles, articles without abstract, observational studies and articles on fractures following shoulder arthroplasty. There were 8 prospective case series and one cohort study, however, majority of the included studies were retrospective studies. There were 1237 patients, follow up data were available for 941 patients who underwent either conservative (629) or operative management (512). Non-operative management scapular body fractures had satisfactory results. The scapular neck fractures displaced <10mm have satisfactory outcome following non-operative management. Operative management of displaced glenoid fossa fractures and scapular neck fractures displaced >10mm lead in a better functional outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain and neck-shoulder pain are the most reported types of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, and performing heavy lifting at work and working with trunk rotation increase the risk of developing work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides information about the electrical activity of muscles. Thus it has the potential to retrieve indirect information about the physical exposure of specific muscles of workers during their actual work. This study aimed to investigate the inter-day reliability of absolute and normalized amplitude of sEMG measurements obtained during repeated standardized reference lifts. METHODS: The inter-day reliability of sEMG of the erector spinae longissimus and trapezius descendens muscles was tested during standardized box lifts. The lifts were performed with loads of 3, 15 and 30 kg from floor to table and from table to table in three conditions, i.e., forearm length (short reaching distance), ¾ arm length (long reaching distance) and forearm length with trunk rotation. Absolute and normalized root mean square (absRMS and normRMS) values were extracted. In line with the guidelines for reporting reliability and agreement studies, we reported relative and absolute reliability estimated by intra class correlation (ICC3,K), standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimal detectable change in percent (MDC). RESULTS: The ICC3,K was higher for absRMS compared with normRMS while SEM and maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) were similar. A total of 50 out of 56, i.e., 89%, and 41 out of 56, i.e., 73%, of the lifting situations were in the range from moderate to almost perfect for absRMS and normRMS, respectively. The SEM and MDC shoved more variation in the lifting situations performed from floor to table and in the trapezius descendens muscle than in the erector spinae longissimus muscle. CONCLUSION: This reliability study showed that maximum absRMS and normRMS were found to have a fair to substantial relative inter-day reliability for most lifts but were more reliable when lifting from table to table than from floor to table for both trapezius descendens and erector spinae muscles. The relative inter-day reliability was higher for absolute compared with normalized sEMG amplitudes while the absolute reliability was similar.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the glenopolar angle (GPA) at different inclinations of the scapula using 3D CT, to test the hypothesis that the result could change the indication from conservative treatment to surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of 30 3D CT images of patients' scapulae, measuring the GPA. The GPA was measured with scapulae at 0° and at 20° and 30° of internal and external rotation. Angles were compared by age, sex and examiner for the different angles of rotation of the scapulae. RESULTS: The GPA of scapulae in rotation tended to be smaller than the GPA without rotation, and the larger the degree of rotation, the more the angle was underestimated. Additionally, for the same degree of rotation, internal rotation was associated with greater underestimation of the GPA than external rotation. Two different examiners achieved an excellent level of agreement between angle measurements. The GPA with the scapula at 0° was significantly higher among elderly patients. The variation in GPA with the scapula in rotation (20° and 30°) in relation to the GPA without rotation was significantly greater for female patients. CONCLUSIONS: As the rotation of the scapula was displaced from the scapula in the coronal position (GPA 0°), both in internal rotation and in external rotation, the GPA reduced. Therefore, rotational displacement may lead to an error in GPA measurement, resulting in incorrect indication of treatment. It is recommended that whenever possible, GPA measurements should be taken in neutral rotation, with the scapula in a neutral position at 0°.

AB  - Upper limb three-dimensional movement analysis (UL-3DMA) offers a reliable and valid tool to evaluate movement patterns in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP). However, it remains unknown to what extent the underlying motor impairments explain deviant movement patterns. Such understanding is key to develop efficient rehabilitation programs. Although UL-3DMA has been shown to be a useful tool to assess movement patterns, it results in a multitude of data, challenging the clinical interpretation and consequently its implementation. UL-3DMA reports are often reduced to summary metrics, such as average or peak values per joint. However, these metrics do not take into account the continuous nature of the data or the interdependency between UL joints, and do not provide phase-specific information of the movement pattern. Moreover, summary metrics may not be sensitive enough to estimate the impact of motor impairments. Recently, Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) was proposed to overcome these problems. We collected UL-3DMA of 60 children with uCP and 60 typically developing children during eight functional tasks and evaluated the impact of spasticity and muscle weakness on UL movement patterns. SPM vector field analysis was used to analyze movement patterns at the level of five joints (wrist, elbow, shoulder, scapula, and trunk). Children with uCP showed deviant movement patterns in all joints during a large percentage of the movement cycle. Spasticity and muscle weakness negatively impacted on UL movement patterns during all tasks, which resulted in increased wrist flexion, elbow pronation and flexion, increased shoulder external rotation, decreased shoulder elevation with a preference for movement in the frontal plane and increased trunk internal rotation. Scapular position was altered during movement initiation, although scapular movements were not affected by muscle weakness or spasticity. In conclusion, we identified pathological movement patterns in children with uCP and additionally mapped the negative impact of spasticity and muscle weakness on these movement patterns, providing useful insights that will contribute to treatment planning. Last, we also identified a subset of the most relevant tasks for studying UL movements in children with uCP, which will facilitate the interpretation of UL-3DMA data and undoubtedly contribute to its clinical implementation.

AB  - Subject-specific musculoskeletal models can predict accurate joint and muscle biomechanics thereby helping clinicians and surgeons. Current modeling strategies do not incorporate accurate subject-specific muscle parameters. This study reports a statistical shape model (SSM) based method to predict subject-specific muscle attachment regions on shoulder bones and illustrates the concurrent validity of the predictions. Augmented SSMs of scapula and humerus bones were built using bone meshes and five muscle attachment (origin/insertion) regions which play important role in the shoulder motion and function. Muscle attachments included Subscapularis, Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres Major and Teres Minor on both the bones. The regions were represented by subset of vertices on the bone meshes and were tracked using vertex identifiers. Subject-specific muscle attachment regions were predicted using external set of bones not used in building the SSMs. Validity of predictions was determined by visual inspection and also by using four similarity measures between predicted and manually segmented regions. Excellent concurrent validity was found indicating the higher accuracy of predictions. This method can be effectively employed in modeling pipelines or in automatic segmentation of medical images. Further validations are warranted on all the muscles of the shoulder complex.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cementless surface replacement of the shoulder represents an alternative to conventional stemmed anatomic prostheses. Glenoid erosion is a well-known complication in hemiarthroplasty. However, there is limited data concerning radiographic evaluation and prognostic factors for this phenomenon. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to determine the development of glenoid erosion following shoulder resurfacing using a new measurement technique and detect potential prognostic factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis on 38 shoulders undergoing humeral head resurfacing with a mean follow-up of 65.4 ± 43 months. Clinical and radiographic evaluation followed a standardized protocol including pre- and postoperative Constant score, active range of motion, and X­rays in true anteroposterior view. Three independent observers performed measurements of glenoid erosion. RESULTS: We found good interobserver reliability for glenoid erosion measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 0.74-0.78). Progressive glenoid erosion was present in all cases, averaging 5.5 ± 3.9 mm at more than 5 years' follow-up. Male patients demonstrated increased glenoid bone loss within the first 5 years (p < 0.04). The mean Constant score improved to 55.4 ± 23.6 points at the latest follow-up. Younger age was correlated to increased functional outcome. Revision rate due to painful glenoid erosion was 37%. CONCLUSIONS: Glenoid erosion can be routinely expected in patients undergoing humeral head resurfacing. Painful glenoid erosion leads to deterioration in functional outcome and necessitates revision surgery in a high percentage of cases.

AB  - Altered scapular motions premeditate shoulder impingement and other musculoskeletal disorders. Divergent experimental conditions in previous research precludes rigorous comparisons of non-invasive scapular tracking techniques. This study evaluated scapular orientation measurement methods across an expanded range of humeral postures. Scapular medial/lateral rotation, anterior/posterior tilt and protraction/retraction was measured using an acromion marker cluster (AMC), a scapular locator, and a reference stylus. Motion was captured using reflective markers on the upper body, as well as on the AMC, locator and stylus. A combination of 5â¯arm elevation angles, 3â¯arm elevation planes and 3â¯arm axial rotations was examined. Measurement method interacted with elevation angle and plane of elevation for all three scapular orientation directions (pâ¯<â¯0.01). Method of measurement interacted with axial rotation in anterior/posterior tilt and protraction/retraction (pâ¯<â¯0.01). The AMC had strong agreement with the reference stylus than the locator for the majority of humeral elevations, planes and axial rotations. The AMC underestimated lateral rotation, with the largest difference of â¼2° at 0° elevation. Both the locator and AMC overestimated posterior tilt at high arm elevation by up to 7.4°. Misestimations from using the locator could be enough to potentially obscure meaningful differences in scapular rotations.

AB  - Identification of scapular dyskinesis and evaluation of interventions depend on the ability to properly measure scapulothoracic (ST) motion. The most widely used measurement approach is the acromion marker cluster (AMC), which can yield large errors in extreme humeral elevation and can be inaccurate in children and patient populations. Recently, an individualized regression approach has been proposed as an alternative to the AMC. This technique utilizes the relationship between ST orientation, humerothoracic orientation and acromion process position derived from calibration positions to predict dynamic ST orientations from humerothoracic and acromion process measures during motion. These individualized regressions demonstrated promising results for healthy adults; however, this method had not yet been compared to the more conventional AMC. This study compared ST orientation estimates by the AMC and regression approaches to static ST angles determined by surface markers placed on palpated landmarks in typically developing adolescents performing functional tasks. Both approaches produced errors within the range reported in the literature for skin-based scapular measurement techniques. The performance of the regression approach suffered when applied to positions outside of the range of motion in the set of calibration positions. The AMC significantly underestimated ST internal rotation across all positions and overestimated posterior tilt in some positions. Overall, root mean square errors for the regression approach were smaller than the AMC for every position across all axes of ST motion. Accordingly, we recommend the regression approach as a suitable technique for measuring ST kinematics in functional motion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have proposed various ways to assess scapular dyskinesis. In clinic, assessment tools designed to measure the posterior displacement of the inferior angle of the scapula with reference to the posterior thoracic cage are needed. OBJECTIVES: A novel scapulometer was developed to measure scapular medial border and inferior angle prominence. METHODS: A novel scapulometer was designed to measure the distance from the root of the spine (ROS) and the inferior angle (INF) of the scapula to the thorax wall in 29 participants with scapular dyskinesis bilaterally. Two raters measured the ROS and INF distance of the scapula 3 times bilaterally. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM) were calculated to determine the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. Validity was based on correlations (convergent: ROS and internal/external rotation, and INF and tilt; divergent: ROS/INF and upward rotation of the scapula) using a FASTRAK Polhemus 3-D motion tracking system assessing scapular tilt, internal/external rotation, and upward/downward rotation. RESULTS: The average ROS and INF displacements were 13.7 ± 5.0 mm and 12.5 ± 6.3 mm, respectively. The results showed excellent intra-rater and inter-rater reliability, with ICC = 0.88-0.99 and 0.95-0.99 (SEM = 0.7-0.8 mm), respectively. Correlations were 0.35/0.19 (convergent validity) and 0.07/0.09 (divergent validity). CONCLUSIONS: The novel scapulometer has excellent reliability and fair validity to quantify medial border and inferior angle prominence of the scapula. Further research utilizing this instrument is recommended.

AB  - Study Design Cross-sectional. Background The scapular dyskinesis test (SDT) has demonstrated reliability and validity, but its utility for clinical decision making is unclear. Objectives To characterize the prevalence of scapular dyskinesis in participants with and without shoulder pain, and to determine the influence of blinding to the presence of shoulder pain on prevalence of scapular dyskinesis. Methods Participants (n = 135), 67 with shoulder pain and 68 healthy controls, were included in this study. The SDT was performed by 2 examiners, from a total of 21 physical therapists. The second examiner was blinded to the participant's presence of shoulder pain. The SDT involved participants performing 5 repetitions of shoulder flexion and abduction, while the clinician observed for scapular dyskinesis, as characterized by scapular winging or dysrhythmia. Dyskinesis was rated as normal, subtle, or obvious. Ratings were collapsed into 2 groups, dyskinesis (subtle and obvious) and no dyskinesis (normal), as recommended by expert consensus. Results There were no significant differences for scapular dyskinesis prevalence between the shoulder pain group and control group during the SDT in abduction (shoulder pain, 67.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55, 0.77 and control group, 52.9%; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.64; P = .09) or flexion (shoulder pain, 67.2%; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.77 and control group, 61.8%; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.72; P = .51). There were significant differences (P &#8804;001) between the examiners' SDT ratings in the shoulder pain group. The unblinded examiner reported a higher prevalence when testing the involved shoulder for dyskinesis in flexion (blinded, 67.7%; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.78 and unblinded, 80%; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.88) and during abduction (blinded, 66.2%; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.76 and unblinded, 78.5%; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.87). Conclusion Scapular dyskinesis as assessed with the SDT is not more prevalent in those with shoulder pain. Rating was influenced by an examiner's knowledge of shoulder pain presence. Scapular dyskinesis may represent normal movement variability. Level of Evidence Diagnosis, level 4. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2017;47(8):530-537. Epub 6 Jul 2017. doi:10.2519/jospt.2017.7268.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Movement faults are commonly observed in patients with musculoskeletal pain. The Kinetic Medial Rotation Test (KMRT) is a movement control test used to identify movement faults of the scapula and gleno-humeral joints during arm movement. Objective tests such as the KMRT need to be reliable and valid for the results to be applied across different clinical settings and patient populations. The primary objective of the present study was to determine the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of KMRT in subjects with and without shoulder pain. METHODS: Sixty subjects were included in this study based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two musculoskeletal physiotherapists with different levels of clinical experience performed the tests. The intra-rater reliability was tested in twenty asymptomatic subjects by a single assessor at two week intervals. An equal number of subjects with and without shoulder pain were tested by both the assessors to determine the inter-rater reliability. Both components of the KMRT, the Gleno- Humeral Anterior Translation (GHAT) and the Scapular Forward Tilt (SCFT) were tested. RESULTS: The Kappa values for inter-rater reliability of the GHAT and SCFT were K = 0.68 & K = 0.65 respectively in subjects with shoulder pain. In asymptomatic subjects, the inter-rater reliability of GHAT was K = 0.61 and SCFT was K = 0.85. Intra-rater reliability ranged from K = 0.66 for GHAT to K = 0.87 for SCFT. CONCLUSION: Our study found substantial agreement in inter-rater reliability of KMRT in subjects with shoulder pain, whereas substantial to near perfect agreement was found in intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of KMRT in subjects without shoulder pain.

AB  - This study investigated the characteristics of arm elevation via principal component analysis in symptomatic overhead athletes with scapular dyskinesis. One hundred-thirty-four overhead athletes with scapular dyskinesis [24: inferior angle prominence (pattern I); 46: medial border prominence (pattern II), 64: pattern I + II] were evaluated by three-dimensional electromagnetic motion and electromyography to record the scapular kinematics (upward rotation/posterior tipping/exterior rotation) and muscle activation (upper trapezius: UT; middle trapezius: MT; lower trapezius: LT; serratus anterior: SA) during lowering phase of arm elevation. The results showed: (1) for pattern I and II, the first 3 principal component (PCs) explained 41.4% and 42.6% of total variance of movement; (2) the first PCs were correlated with MT, LT activity (r = 0.41~0.61) and upward rotation, posterior tipping (r = -0.59~-0.33) in pattern I, and UT, MT, SA (r = 0.30~0.70) activity in pattern II; (3) contour plots of muscle activity demonstrated that muscle activities varied with dyskinesis patterns. In summary, for the pattern I, the major characteristics are coactivation of MT and LT and corresponding scapular posterior tipping and upward rotation. For the pattern II, the major characteristics are coactivation of UT, MT and SA without corresponding scapular external rotation.

AB  - Clinical evaluation of scapular dyskinesis (SD) aims to identify abnormal scapulothoracic movement, underlying causal factors, and the potential relationship with shoulder symptoms. The literature proposes different methods of dynamic clinical evaluation of SD, but improved reliability and agreement values are needed. The present study aimed to evaluate the intrarater and interrater agreement and reliability of three SD classifications: 1) 4-type classification, 2) Yes/No classification, and 3) scapular dyskinesis test (SDT). Seventy-five young athletes, including 45 men and 30 women, were evaluated. Raters evaluated the SD based on the three methods during one series of 8-10 cycles (at least eight and maximum of ten) of forward flexion and abduction with an external load under the observation of two raters trained to diagnose SD. The evaluation protocol was repeated after 3 h for intrarater analysis. The agreement percentage was calculated by dividing the observed agreement by the total number of observations. Reliability was calculated using Cohen Kappa coefficient, with a 95% confidence interval (CI), defined by Kappa coefficient ±1.96 multiplied by the measurement standard error. The interrater analyses showed an agreement percentage between 80% and 95.9% and an almost perfect reliability (k>0.81) for the three classification methods in all the test conditions, except the 4-type and SDT classification methods, which had substantial reliability (k<0.80) in shoulder abduction. Intrarater analyses showed agreement percentages between 80.7% and 89.3% and substantial reliability (0.67 to 0.81) for both raters in the three classifications. CIs ranged from moderate to almost perfect categories. This indicates that the three SD classification methods investigated in this study showed high reliability values for both intrarater and interrater evaluation throughout a protocol that provided SD evaluation training of raters and included several repetitions of arm movements with external load during a live assessment.

AB  - This review investigates current protocols using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in shoulder research, and outlines future paths regarding IMU use for shoulder research. Different databases were searched for relevant articles. Criteria for study selection were (1) research in healthy persons or persons with shoulder problems, (2) IMUs applied as assessment tool for the shoulder (in healthy subjects and shoulder patients) or upper limb (in shoulder patients), (3) peer-reviewed, full-text papers in English or Dutch. Studies with less than five participants and without ethical approval were excluded. Data extraction included (1) study design, (2) participant characteristics, (3) type/brand of IMU, (4) tasks included in the assessment protocol, and (5) outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Scapulothoracic/glenohumeral and humerothoracic kinematics were reported in respectively 10 and 27 of the 37 included papers. Only one paper in healthy persons assessed, next to scapulothoracic/glenohumeral kinematics, other upper limb joints. IMUs' validity and reliability to capture shoulder function was limited. Considering applied protocols, 39% of the protocols was located on the International-Classification-of-Functioning (ICF) function level, while 38% and 23% were on the 'capacity' and 'actual performance'-sublevel, of the ICF-activity level. Most available IMU-research regarding the shoulder is clinically less relevant, given the widely reported humerothoracic kinematics which do not add to clinical-decision-making, and the absence of protocols assessing the complete upper limb chain. Apart from knowledge on methodological pitfalls and opportunities regarding the use of IMUs, this review provides future research paths.

AB  - Objetivo: El propósito de esta investigación es determinar el cambio de posición del cóndilo dentro de la cavidad glenoidea en pacientes clase II Esqueletal con mordida profunda después de la utilización de un plano de mordida anterior fijo acrílico y metálico.  Materiales y Métodos: Se tomará una muestra del 20% de un universo de 100 pacientes de Clínica de la Escuela de Postgrado de la Facultad de Odontología de la Universidad de Guayaquil para demostrar  los cambios que se producen en la articulación temporomandibular como consecuencia de la nueva posición adoptada por el cóndilo debido a la nueva postura mandibular por el  uso del plano de mordida.  Estos pacientes serán evaluados a través de radiografías cefalométricas que serán tomadas en el transcurso del uso de los planos de mordida anterior hasta el momento que se ha conseguido el contacto del segmento posterior de las piezas dentarias  donde se tomará en consideración el cambio de posición del cóndilo y de esta manera determinar la estabilidad que se desea conseguir en el tratamiento. Resultados: Todos los pacientes que utilizaron plano de mordida anterior metálico obtuvieron en el 100% el cambio de posición del cóndilo mandibular, llegando a la norma de 32+-2; mientras que el 69,23% de los pacientes que utilizaron el plano de mordida anterior acrílico  tuvieron un cambio positivo y el 30,77% fue negativo.  Conclusiones: Por lo tanto se concluye que con el plano de mordida anterior metálico se obtiene mayor exactitud en el cambio de posición del cóndilo mandibular.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation is to determine the change of position of the condyle within the glenoid cavity in class II patients with deep bite after the use of a fixed anterior Acrylic and Metallic bite plane, which will be done with a sample of the 20% of a universe of 100 patients from Clinic of the Postgraduate School of the Faculty of Dentistry of the University of Guayaquil to demonstrate the changes that occur in the temporomandibular joint resulting from the new position adopted by the condyle due to the new mandibular posture by the use of the bite plane. These patients will be evaluated through cephalometric radiographs that will be taken in the course of the use of the anterior bite planes until the contact of the posterior segment of the dental pieces has been achieved where the change of position of the condyle will be taken into account And thus determine the stability to be achieved in the treatment. The results that presented the patients in the change of position of the mandibular condyle that they used plane of previous bite Metallic was positive in 100% of them, arriving at the norm of 32 + -2; While 69.23% of patients who used the anterior acrylic bite plane had a positive change and 30.77% were negative; Therefore it is concluded that with the Metallic anterior bite plane, greater accuracy is obtained in the position change of the mandibular condyle.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort. INTRODUCTION: Assessment of scapular dysfunction is considered important in the clinical evaluation and treatment of patients with symptoms of subacromial impingement. However, sparse research has been conducted into the reliability and predictive value of clinical tests with which to identify scapular dyskinesis. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To evaluate intrarater and interrater reliability and predictive value of the Scapular Dyskinesis Test (SDT) in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome. METHODS: Forty-five patients with subacromial impingement syndrome were included. The presence of scapular dyskinesis was classified by 2 raters using the SDT. Intrarater and interrater reliabilities were examined and compared. Patients with and without scapular dyskinesis were compared in terms of Oxford Shoulder Score and EQ-5D-5L scores at baseline and 3 months, as well rating of overall improvement in shoulder condition. RESULTS: SDT could not be performed in 5 patients, leaving 40 patients for further analysis. Kappa with squared weights was 0.64 for rater A and 0.86 for rater B; the intrarater agreement was 88% for A and 96% for B. For interrater comparison, the Kappa value was 0.59 and agreement 86%. No statically significant differences in Oxford Shoulder Score and EQ-5D-5L baseline and change scores or overall improvement in shoulder condition at 3 months were observed between patients with or without scapular dyskinesis. CONCLUSIONS: Intrarater and interrater reliability and agreement of the SDT were determined. The findings that functional impairment and outcomes did not differ between patients with or without the presences of scapular dyskinesis may question the clinical value of the SDT in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1b.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Levator scapulae (LS) muscle stretching exercises are a common method of lengthening a shortened muscle; however, the appropriate stretching position for lengthening the LS in people with a shortened LS remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of different stretching exercise positions on the LS and introduce effective stretching exercise methods to clinicians. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four university students (12 men, 12 women) with a shortened LS were recruited. METHODS: LS muscle activity, LS index (LSI), and cervical range of motion (ROM) were measured pre (baseline) and post three different stretching exercise positions (sitting, quadruped, and prone). RESULTS: The LSI and cervical ROM exceeded the minimal detectable change and had significant changes. The LSI was greater in the sitting position than at the baseline (p = 0.01), quadruped position (p < 0.01); the LSI in the prone position presented a higher increase than the quadruped position (p = 0.01). The cervical ROM increased in the sitting position when compared to the baseline (p < 0.01) and quadruped position (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Stretching the LS in the sitting position was the most effective exercise for improving LS muscle length and cervical ROM.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Symptomatic glenoid erosion is one of the most common causes of functional impairment after shoulder hemiarthroplasty. A decrease in the critical shoulder angle (CSA) has been associated with the development of shoulder arthritis. The inter-observer reliability of the CSA and the relationship between CSA and symptomatic glenoid erosion after shoulder hemiarthroplasty were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with symptomatic glenoid erosion after anatomic hemiarthroplasty were compared to a control group of 30 patients with no signs of symptomatic glenoid erosion. The CSA was measured by two blinded shoulder surgeons at a mean follow-up of 105.2 and 54.7 months, respectively. The inter-observer reliability was calculated. RESULTS: The mean CSA in the control group in neutral, internal, and external rotations was 34°, 33°, and 33°, respectively. The corresponding values in the study group were 33°, 33°, and 33° (<0.01). The interclass correlation coefficient between the two examiners was 0.917 (P < 0.01), 0.924 (P < 0.01), and 0.948 (P < 0.01), respectively. The Mann-Whitney test between the control group and the study group were, respectively, 0.907, 0.932, and 0.602. CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences of CSA values between the two groups. Good inter-observer reliability was found for the CSA method.

AB  - Acromion marker cluster (AMC) methods have been shown to accurately track scapula motion during humeral elevation below 90°, however, their accuracy has not been assessed in shoulder girdle motion such as clavicle protraction, retraction, elevation, and depression independent of humeral movement. The aim of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the AMC method to record scapula orientation at end range clavicle protraction, retraction, elevation, and depression. The right scapulae of 22 female and 20 male asymptomatic volunteers were assessed with an AMC and scapula locator (SL) method during end range clavicle protraction, retraction, elevation, and depression (without humeral elevation) using an 8-camera 3D movement registration system. Measurements recorded from the AMC and SL measures showed fair to excellent agreement (ICC 0.4-0.92). While the AMC method overestimated and underestimated scapular motion in some planes compared to the SL, root mean square error between methods were low for scapular internal/external rotation (2.3-3.7°), upward/downward rotation (4.5-6.6°), and anterior/posterior tilt (3.2-5.1°), across all conditions. The AMC method was shown to be a reliable and valid measurement of scapula orientation at end range clavicle movements independent of humeral movement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Suprascapular nerve repair is a widely-prioritized procedure for shoulder reconstruction following brachial plexus injury. Although this procedure only reconstructs glenohumeral joint motion, the standard clinical assessment of shoulder function also includes the scapulothoracic joint contribution. The purpose of this preliminary study was to develop an objective method to accurately analyze shoulder abduction following suprascapular nerve repair in brachial plexus injury patients. METHODS: We introduced an objective method to accurately analyze independent shoulder abduction performed by supraspinatus muscle with the help of dynamic shoulder radiography. Antero-posterior radiographs of both shoulders in adduction and maximal active abduction were obtained. Five parameters were measured. They included global abduction, abduction in glenohumeral, scapulothoracic and clavicular joints along with lateral flexion of thoracic spine. Data were analyzed to distinguish glenohumeral joint contribution from that of scapulothoracic motion. The detailed biomechanics of glenohumeral motion were also analyzed in relation to scapulothoracic motion to separately define the contribution of each in global shoulder abduction. RESULTS: The test-retest, intra-examiner and inter-examiner reliabilities of the measurements were assessed. Intra-class correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman plots and repeatability coefficients showed excellent reliability for each parameter. The range of glenohumeral abduction showed high correlation to subtraction of the range of scapulothoracic from the range of global abduction. However, not all negative ranges of glenohumeral abduction meant non-recovery after nerve repair, because scapulothoracic motion contributed in parallel but not uniformly to global shoulder motion. CONCLUSION: The conventional measurement of shoulder global abduction with goniometer is not an appropriate method to analyze the results of suprascapular nerve repair in brachial plexus palsy patients. We recommend examination of glenohumeral and scapulothoracic motions separately with dynamic shoulder radiographic analysis. With scapulothoracic contribution to the global shoulder motion, the glenohumeral motion can be wrongly assessed.

AB  - Repetitive overhead movements have been identified as a main risk factor to develop shoulder complaints with scapular muscle activity being altered. Reliable assessment of muscle activity is essential to differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the intra- and inter-session reliability of scapular muscle activity during maximal isokinetic shoulder flexion and extension. Eleven asymptomatic adults performed maximum effort isokinetic shoulder flexion and extension (concentric and eccentric at 60°/s) in a test-retest design. Muscle activity of the upper and lower trapezius and serratus anterior was assessed by sEMG. Root Mean Square was calculated for whole ROM and single movement phases of absolute and normalized muscle activity. Absolute (Bland-Altman analysis (Bias, LoA), Minimal detectable change (MDC)) and relative reliability parameters (Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV)/test-retest variability (TRV)) were utilized for the evaluation of reproducibility. Intra-session reliability revealed ICCs between 0.56 and 0.98, averaged CVs of 18% and average MDCs of 81mV. Inter-session reliability resulted in ICCs between 0.13 and 0.93, averaged TRVs of 21%, average MDCs of 15% and systematic and random error between -8±60% and 12±36%. Scapular muscle activity assessed in overhead movements can be measured reliably under maximum load conditions, though variability is dependent on the movement phase. Measurement variability does not exceed magnitudes of altered scapular muscle activities as reported in previous studies. Therefore, maximum load application is a promising approach for the evaluation of changes in scapular control related to pathologies.

AB  - BACKGROUND & PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of the scapula backward tipping test (SBTT) in detecting the presence of pectoralis minor (PM) tightness and subsequently scapula forward tipping, in a symptomatic population. PM tightness with scapula forward tipping has been described to cause pain and dysfunction in the shoulder region. METHODS: 30 patients with a diagnosis of shoulder pain were randomly assigned and examined by 2 musculoskeletal physical therapists at a time. The procedure consisted of having the individual lay on the stomach in a neutral head position with palms in the anatomical position. The examiner firmly stabilized the inferior angle of the scapula with one hand and the fingers of the other hand hooked the under surface of the coracoid process. A gentle yet firm pull was imparted in an upward direction to sense tightness and to observe movement of the acromion up to the tragus of the ear. A comparison was made with the other side to sense restriction. Inter-rater reliability was determined using the kappa statistic. RESULTS: The SBTT was found to be reproducible between examiners (Kappa = 0.735, SE of kappa = 0.123, 95% confidence interval), with a percentage agreement of 86.67%. CONCLUSION: The SBTT may be incorporated as a simple yet effective test to determine the presence of PM tightness and subsequently scapula forward tipping.

AB  - The goal of this study was to develop and validate a non-invasive approach to estimate scapular kinematics in individual patients. We hypothesized that individualized mathematical algorithms can be developed using motion capture data to accurately estimate dynamic scapula orientation based on measured humeral orientations and acromion process positions. The accuracy of the mathematical algorithms was evaluated against a gold standard of biplane fluoroscopy using a 2D to 3D fluoroscopy/model matching process. Individualized linear models were developed for nine healthy adult shoulders. These models were used to predict scapulothoracic kinematics, and the predicted kinematics were compared to kinematics obtained using biplane fluoroscopy to determine the accuracy of the algorithms. Results showed strong correlations between mathematically predicted kinematics and validation kinematics. Estimated kinematics were within 8° of validation kinematics. We concluded that individualized linear models show promise for providing accurate, non-invasive measurements of scapulothoracic kinematics in a clinical environment.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to summarize and evaluate intra- and interrater reliability research of physical examination tests used for the assessment of scapular dyskinesis. BACKGROUND: Scapular dyskinesis, defined as alteration of normal scapular kinematics, is described as a non-specific response to different shoulder pathologies. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED and PEDro until March 20th, 2015. Methodological quality was assessed with the Quality Appraisal of Reliability Studies (QAREL) by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: The search strategy revealed 3259 articles, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. These studies evaluated the reliability of 41 test and test variations used for the assessment of scapular dyskinesis. CONCLUSION: This review identified a lack of high-quality studies evaluating intra- as well as interrater reliability of tests used for the assessment of scapular dyskinesis. In addition, reliability measures differed between included studies hindering proper cross-study comparisons. The effect of manual correction of the scapula on shoulder symptoms was evaluated in only one study, which is striking, since symptom alteration tests are used in routine care to guide further treatment. Thus, there is a strong need for further research in this area. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnosis, level 3a.

AB  - Background: Deviant shoulder girdle movement is suggested as an eminent factor in the etiology of shoulder pain. Reliable measurements of shoulder girdle kinematics are a prerequisite for optimizing clinical management strategies. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability, measurement error, and internal consistency of measurements with performance-based clinical tests for shoulder girdle kinematics and positioning in patients with shoulder pain. Data Sources: The MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases were systematically searched from inception to August 2015. Study Selection: Articles published in Dutch, English, or German were included if they involved the evaluation of at least one of the measurement properties of interest. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently evaluated the methodological quality per studied measurement property with the 4-point-rating scale of the COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) checklist, extracted data, and assessed the adequacy of the measurement properties. Data Synthesis: Forty studies comprising more than 30 clinical tests were included. Actual reported measurements of the tests were categorized into: (1) positional measurement methods, (2) measurement methods to determine dynamic characteristics, and (3) tests to diagnose impairments of shoulder girdle function. Best evidence synthesis of the tests was performed per measurement for each measurement property. Limitations: All studies had significant limitations, including incongruence between test description and actual reported measurements and a lack of reporting on minimal important change. In general, the methodological quality of the selected studies was fair to poor. Conclusions: High-quality evidence indicates that measurements obtained with the Modified Scapular Assistance Test are not reliable for clinical use. Sound recommendations for the use of other tests could not be made due to inadequate evidence. Across studies, diversity in description, performance, and interpretation of similar tests was present, and different criteria were used to establish similar diagnoses, mostly without taking into account a clinically meaningful context. Consequently, these tests lack face validity, which hampers their clinical use. Further research on validity and how to integrate a clinically meaningful context of movement into clinical tests is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Appropriate evaluation of scapular dyskinesis is essential for therapeutic strategies. Although the current visual-based assessment is rapid and practical, the reliability of this method is unsatisfactory. It is necessary to adequately understand the conditions of assessment to maximize the benefit of therapeutic interventions. OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of different test positions on clinical assessment for scapular dyskinesis. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: University rehabilitation department. PATIENTS: A total of 102 subjects diagnosed with unilateral shoulder disorder were recruited from among rehabilitation outpatients from November 2015 to February 2016. METHODS: Two experienced raters categorized the subjects' scapular movement pattern according to Kibler et al classification by the vision-palpation method at 4 test positions (at rest, and the end range of elevation in the sagittal, scapular, and coronal planes). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The overall prevalence of scapular dyskinesis, the distribution of types, and the reproducibility of types at the 4 test positions were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of scapular dyskinesis was 90.08%, and the highest frequency was found at the resting position. Type III was the most common type in our sample. In reproducibility analysis, 21.57% of subjects presented with the same type at any position, and 75.49% of subjects presented with 2 types. CONCLUSIONS: Scapular dyskinesis in individuals with shoulder disorder showed a high prevalence, especially at the resting position. More than 1 type of scapular pattern would be present if assessed at different positions. This study indicates that test positions can affect the results of scapular dyskinesis assessment, and that the resting position should primarily be applied. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

AB  - Markers put on the arm undergo large soft tissue artefact (STA). Using markers on the forearm, multibody kinematics optimization (MKO) helps improve the accuracy of the arm kinematics especially its longitudinal rotation. However deleterious effect of STA may persist and affect other segment estimate. The objective was to present an innovative multibody kinematics optimization algorithm with projection of markers onto a requested axis of the local system of coordinates, to cancel their deleterious effect on this degree-of-freedom. Four subjects equipped with markers put on intracortical pins inserted into the humerus, on skin (scapula, arm and forearm) and subsequently on rigid cuffs (arm and forearm) performed analytic, daily-living, sports and range-of-motion tasks. Scapulohumeral kinematics was estimated using 1) pin markers (reference), 2) single-body optimization, 3) MKO, 4) MKO with projection of all arm markers and 5) MKO with projection of a selection of arm markers. Approaches 2-4 were applied to markers put on the skin and the cuff. The main findings were that multibody kinematics optimization improved the accuracy of 40-50% and the projection algorithm added an extra 20% when applied to cuff markers or a selection of skin markers (all but the medial epicondyle). Therefore, the projection algorithm performed better than multibody and single-body optimizations, especially when using markers put on a cuff. Error of humerus orientation was reduced by half to finally be less than 5°. To conclude, this innovative algorithm is a promising approach for estimating accurate upper-limb kinematics.

AB  - While synchronous movement of the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints has been emphasized in previous kinematics studies, most investigations of shoulder joint position sense have treated the shoulder complex as a single joint. The purposes of this study were to investigate the joint position sense errors of the humerothoracic, glenohumeral, and scapulothoracic joints at different elevation angles and to examine whether the errors of the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints contribute to the errors of the humerothoracic joint. Fifty-one subjects with healthy shoulders were recruited. Active joint position sense of the humerothoracic, glenohumeral, and scapulothoracic joints was measured at 50°, 70°, and 90° of humerothoracic elevation in the scapular plane. The results showed that while scapulothoracic joint position sense errors were not affected by target angles, there was an angle effect on humerothoracic and glenohumeral errors, with errors decreasing as the target angles approached 90° of elevation. The results of a multiple regression analysis revealed that glenohumeral errors explained most of the variance of the humerothoracic errors and that scapulothoracic errors had a weaker predictive relationship with humerothoracic errors. Therefore, it may be necessary to test scapular joint position sense separately in addition to the assessment of the overall shoulder joint position sense.

AB  - Team handball is a popular sport worldwide that requires numerous throws to be made throughout the course of a game. Because of the upper extremity demands of repetitive throwing, it is possible that fatigue can alter the mechanics of a shot. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of localised fatigue on jump shot kinematics and kinetics. Eleven male team handball players (23.1 ± 3.1 years; 185.1 ± 8.3 cm; 89.7 ± 12.2 kg) volunteered. An electromagnetic tracking system was used to examine the jump shot prior to and following localised fatigue. The fatiguing protocol consisted of throwing a 2.2 kg medicine ball into a rebounder until volitional fatigue. No significant kinematic or kinetic differences were observed following fatigue. Shoulder external rotation was -74.8 ± 14.9° prior to and -79.0 ± 14.7° following fatigue at MER. Scapula, external rotation at ball release (BR) prior to fatigue was -2.2 ± 7.0° and -3.2 ± 11.1° following fatigue. Scapular internal rotation, at maximum shoulder internal rotation (MIR), changed from 18.4 ± 11.2° to 20.4 ± 11.8°. Ball velocity decreased from19.8 m · s-1 to 18.8 m · s-1 (P = 0.12). Accuracy percentage in the pre-fatigue trials was 60.8 ± 14.1% and 52.8 ± 12.7% following fatigue (P = 0.20). While no significant changes were observed, it is possible that other fatiguing protocols that more closely represent the aerobic and throwing demands of the sport may have a greater effect on the kinematics and kinetics of the jump shot.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of a minimally invasive surgical technique for the treatment of patients with acromioclavicular joint dislocation. METHODS: Sixteen patients with complete acromioclavicular joint dislocation were enrolled in this study. All patients were asked to follow the less active rehabilitation protocol post-operatively. Computed tomography with 3-D reconstruction of the injured shoulder was performed on each patient post operatively for the assessment of the accuracy of the suture anchor placement in the coracoid process and the reduction of the acromioclavicular joint. Radiographs of Zanca view and axillary view of both shoulders were taken for evaluating the maintenance of the acromioclavicular joint reduction at each follow-up visit. The Constant shoulder score was used for function assessment at the final follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty seven of the 32 anchors implanted in the coracoid process met the criteria of good position. One patient developed complete loss of reduction and another had partial loss of reduction in the anteroposterior plane. For the other 14 patients, the mean Constant score was 90 (range, 82-95). For the patients with partial and complete loss of reduction, the Constant score were 92 and 76 respectively. All of them got nearly normal range of motion of the shoulders and restored to pre-operative life and works. CONCLUSION: With this minimally invasive approach and limited exposure of the coracoid, a surgeon can place the suture anchors at the anatomical insertions of the coracoclavicular ligament and allow the dislocated joint reduced and maintained well. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, Case series; therapeutic study.

AB  - Cadaveric experiments were undertaken to validate a finite element (FE) modeling approach for studying impingement-related scapular notching in reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). The specific focus of the validation was contact at the site of impingement between the humeral polyethylene component and the inferior aspect of the scapula during an adduction motion. Lateralization of the RSA center of rotation was varied because it has been advocated clinically to reduce impingement and presumably decrease the risk of scapular notching. Tekscan sensors were utilized to directly measure contact stress at the impingement site, and FE was used to compute contact stresses. Favorable agreement was seen between physically measured and FE-computed impingement site location (within one sensing element of the Tekscan sensor) and contact loads (mean absolute difference of 14.9%). Contact stresses and contact areas were difficult to compare directly due to the disparate spatial resolutions of the Tekscan sensor and the FE model. FE-computed contact at the impingement site was highly focal, with a total contact area comparable to the area of an individual Tekscan sensing element. The good agreement between the physically measured and FE-computed contact data (i.e., contact load and location) support the use of FE modeling as a tool for computationally testing the efficacy of changing various surgical variables associated with RSA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anatomic studies have demonstrated that bipolar glenoid and humeral bone loss have a cumulative effect on shoulder instability and that these defects may engage in functional positions depending on their size and location, potentially resulting in failure of stabilization procedures. Determining which lesions pose a risk for engagement remains challenging, with arthroscopic assessments and a 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT)-based glenoid track method being accepted approaches at this time. PURPOSE: The purpose was to investigate the interaction of humeral and glenoid bone defects on shoulder engagement in a cadaveric model. Two alternative approaches to predicting engagement were evaluated: (1) CT of the shoulder in abduction and external rotation (ABER) and (2) measurement of the glenoid lesion width and measurement of a novel parameter, the intact anterior articular angle (IAAA), on conventional 2-dimensional multiplane reformats. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Hill-Sachs and glenoid defects of varying sizes were created in 12 cadaveric upper limbs, producing 45 bipolar defect combinations. The defect characteristics were assessed using CT with the shoulder in a neutral position. ABER CT was performed with the shoulder positioned in 60° of glenohumeral abduction (corresponding to 90° of abduction relative to the trunk) and 90° of external rotation. The IAAA was measured as the cartilage arc angle anterior to the Hill-Sachs defect on the axial slice bisecting the humeral head. The performance of the ABER CT and IAAA approaches to predicting engagement were compared with the glenoid track method. RESULTS: Of the 45 defect combinations, 24 (53%) were classified as engaging using the glenoid track method. ABER CT predicted engagement accurately in 43 of 45 (96%), with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 100%, respectively. A logistic model based on the glenoid defect width and IAAA provided a prediction accuracy of 87%, with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 81%, respectively. CONCLUSION/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Bipolar lesions at risk for engagement can be identified accurately using an ABER CT scan or by performing 2-dimensional measurements of the glenoid defect width and IAAA on conventional CT multiplane reformats. This information will be useful for surgical planning in the setting of bipolar bone defects before shoulder stabilization.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Shoulder complaints are frequently encountered in general practice, but precise diagnosing is challenging. This study investigated agreement of shoulder complaints diagnoses between clinicians in a primary health care setting. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Four primary health care clinicians used patients' history and functional examination of the shoulder by selective tissue tension techniques (STTs), to diagnose shoulder complaints. SUBJECTS: 62 patients, aged 18-75 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reliability of diagnoses was assessed by observed intertester agreement and Cohen's kappa. A total of 372 diagnostic pairs were available for intertester comparisons. RESULTS: Six diagnoses were assigned by all clinicians; supraspinatus-, infraspinatus-, subscapularis-tendinopathies; chronic subacromial bursitis; glenohumeral capsulitis, and acromioclavicular joint lesion. The observed agreement on these diagnoses ranged from 0.84 for glenohumeral capsulitis to 0.97 for acromioclavicular joint lesion. Kappa scores were 0.46 (95% CI 0.33, 0.58) for chronic subacromial bursitis; 0.53 (95% CI 0.34, 0.68), 0.59 (95% CI 0.47, 0.70), and 0.68 (95% CI 0.53, 0.82) for infraspinatus -, supraspinatus -, and subscapularis-tendinopathy, respectively. For glenohumeral capsulitis and acromioclavicular lesion kappa scores were 0.66 (95% CI 0.57, 0.73) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.61, 0.90). Kappa scores were higher for individual diagnoses than for individual tests, except for limitation in passive abduction (0.70, 95% CI 0.62, 0.78) and passive lateral rotation (0.66, 95% CI 0.57, 0.73). CONCLUSIONS: Although experienced clinicians showed substantial intertester agreement, precise diagnoses of shoulder complaints in primary health care remain a challenge. The present results call for further research on refined diagnoses of shoulder complaints. Key points   Based on medical history and a systematic functional examination by selective tissue tension techniques (STTs), we investigated the agreement of shoulder complaints diagnoses across four primary health care clinicians and 62 patients. â¢ Agreements on diagnoses were generally better than the agreement on individual tests. â¢ Good kappa scores were obtained for the diagnoses glenohumeral capsulitis, rotator cuff tendinopathy, and acromioclavicular lesion. â¢ Further research is necessary to investigate the diagnostic validity of functional shoulder examination by the STTs method.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of combined humeral and glenoid defects varies between 79 and 84 % in case of chronic posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between humeral and glenoid defects based on quantitative radiological criteria. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed between 2000 and 2011 including patients who underwent primary surgical shoulder stabilization for chronic posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability, with bone defects in both the glenoid and humerus and a healthy contralateral shoulder. The following measurements were taken: D/R ratio (Hill-Sachs lesion depth/humeral head radius) on an AP X-ray in internal rotation and the D1/D2 ratio [diameter of the involved glenoid articular surfaces (D1)/the healthy one (D2)] on a comparative Bernageau glenoid profile view. Measurements were taken by two observers. Correlations were determined by the Spearman correlation coefficients (r), Bland and Altman diagrams, and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). A sample size calculation was done. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included, 25 men/5 women, mean age 29.8 ± 11.2 years. The mean D/R was 23 ± 12 % for observer 1 and 23 ± 10 % for observer 2. The mean D1/D2 was 95 ± 4 % for observer 1 and 94 ± 6 % for observer 2. No significant correlation was found between humeral and glenoid bone defects by observer 1 (r = 0.23, p = 0.22) or observer 2 (r = 0.05, p = 0.78). Agreement of the observers for the D/R ratio was excellent (ICC = 0.89 ± 0.04, p < 0.00001) and good for the D1/D2 ratio (ICC = 0.54 ± 0.14, p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Humeral and glenoid bone defects were not correlated. Inter-observer reliability was excellent for the D/R ratio and good for the D1/D2 ratio. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Nonconsecutive Patients, Diagnostic Study, Level III.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Investigate reliability of shoulder internal and external rotation (IR, ER), abduction in internal rotation (ABIR) and combined elevation (CE) range of motion tests in competitive swimmers. DESIGN: Within participants, inter- and intra-examiner reliability. SETTING: Physiotherapy Department, University of Melbourne, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 17 competitive swimmers (aged 12-24 years) who participate in at least 5 weekly swimming sessions and two physiotherapy examiners. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inter- and intra-examiner reliability of IR, ER, ABIR and CE. RESULTS: Good to excellent intra-examiner reliability across tests (ICCs: 0.85-0.96) with standard error of measurement (SEM)and minimal detectable change at 90% confidence interval (MDC90) ranging from 2 to 5, and 5-12°, respectively. Good to excellent inter-examiner reliability for all tests (ICCs: 0.77-0.94) except left IR (ICC: 0.65). Inter-examiner SEM and MDC90 ranged from 2 to 5° and 5-12°, respectively. CONCLUSION: Shoulder range of motion tests were reliable when applied by the same examiner. Inter-examiner reliability was acceptable for all tests except IR, which was affected by inconsistent manual scapula stabilisation between examiners.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Lateral Scapular Slide Test is a static test used in clinical settings to assess medio-lateral inferior angle displacement and scapular asymmetry at three different degrees of shoulder abduction. However, there is no evidence in the literature about the reliability and diagnostic accuracy of a modified LSST (arm elevation in the scapular plane with loading) in a symptomatic population. OBJECTIVE: To assess the intra- and inter-rater reliability, agreement, and diagnostic accuracy of the MLSST â (Modified Lateral Scapular Slide Test) in subjects with and without shoulder symptoms. A new test position is examined, in which the arm is held in 90° of elevation in the scapular plane with 1 kg load. DESIGN: Within day intra- and inter-rater reliability, agreement, and diagnostic accuracy study. METHOD: Participants included 25 (42 ± 2.7 years) subjects with shoulder symptoms and 25 (40 ± 2.1 years) asymptomatic control subjects. Two raters, blinded to each other's outcomes, measured the distance between the inferior scapular angle and T7 at arms by the side, hands on hips and 90° of arm elevation in the scapular plane with 1 kg load. Measurements were performed twice, bilaterally. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), minimal detectable change (MDC95%) and diagnostic accuracy were calculated. RESULTS: The ICCs for intra- and inter-rater reliability were good to high in both shoulders of symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. The MDC95% in the symptomatic group ranged between 0.67 and 1.40 cm in the symptomatic shoulder and 0.72-1.16 cm in the asymptomatic shoulder. The asymptomatic group presented a MDC95% ranging between 0.63 and 1.52 cm in the dominant and 0.60-1.41 cm in the non dominant shoulder. Positive and negative likelihood ratios ranged between 0.67-5.50 and 0.81-1.11, respectively. CONCLUSION: The MLSST had good reliability and agreement properties to assess scapular position in both groups. However, no test position had clinical utility as a diagnostic criterion for shoulder pathology.

AB  - Motion analysis systems deliver quantitative information, e.g. on the progress of rehabilitation programs aimed at improving range of motion. Markerless systems are of interest for clinical application because they are low-cost and easy to use. The first generation of the Kinect&#8482; sensor showed promising results in validity assessment compared to an established marker-based system. However, no literature is available on the validity of the new 'Kinect&#8482; for Xbox one' (KinectOne) in tracking upper body motion. Consequently, this study was conducted to analyze the accuracy and reliability of the KinectOne in tracking upper body motion. Twenty subjects performed shoulder abduction in frontal and scapula plane, flexion, external rotation and horizontal flexion in two conditions (sitting and standing). Arm and trunk motion were analyzed using the KinectOne and compared to a marker-based system. Comparisons were made using Bland Altman statistics and Coefficient of Multiple Correlation. On average, differences between systems of 3.9±4.0° and 0.1±3.8° were found for arm and trunk motion, respectively. Correlation was higher for the arm than for the trunk motion. Based on the observed bias, the accuracy of the KinectOne was found to be adequate to measure arm motion in a clinical setting. Although trunk motion showed a very low absolute bias between the two systems, the KinectOne was not able to track small changes over time. Before the KinectOne can find clinical application, further research is required analyzing whether validity can be improved using a customized tracking algorithm or other sensor placement, and to analyze test-retest reliability.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to introduce levator scapulae (LS) measurement using a caliper and the levator scapulae index (LSI) and to investigate intra- and interrater reliability of the LSI in subjects with and without scapular downward rotation syndrome (SDRS). DESIGN: Two raters measured LS length twice in 38 subjects (19 with SDRS and 19 without SDRS). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For reliability testing, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), standard error of measurement (SEM), and minimal detectable change (MDC) were calculated. RESULTS: Intrarater reliability analysis resulted with ICCs ranging from 0.94 to 0.98 in subjects with SDRS and 0.96 to 0.98 in subjects without SDRS. These results represented that intrarater reliability in both groups were excellent for measuring LS length with the LSI. Interrater reliability was good (ICC: 0.82) in subjects with SDRS; however, interrater reliability was moderate (ICC: 0.75) in subjects without SDRS. Additionally, SEM and MDC were 0.13% and 0.36% in subjects with SDRS and 0.35% and 0.97% in subjects without SDRS. In subjects with SDRS, low dispersion of the measurement errors and MDC were shown. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that the LSI is a reliable method to measure LS length and is more reliable for subjects with SDRS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical scapulohumeral tests are lacking post-stroke. OBJECTIVE: To test reliability and discriminant validity of clinical scapulohumeral assessments post-stroke. METHODS: Following tests were assessed in 57 individuals with stroke (IwS) (subdivided in a low, moderate, high proximal arm function (PAF) group) and 15 healthy controls: (1) Observation of tilting/winging; (2) shoulder girdle position tests (pectoralis minor index, acromial index, scapular distance test); (3) scapular lateral rotation measurement; (4) maximal humeral elevation and (5) medial rotation test were executed. 15 IwS were measured twice by the same assessor to determine test-retest reliability. Differences between controls and IwS and between IwS with different levels of PAF were assessed. RESULTS: ICCs were very high for all tests (>0.80), except the pectoralis minor index (0.66). Weighted Kappas were high for observation and the medial rotation test (>0.70). Group differences were found for observation, lateral rotation and humeral elevation. IwS compared to controls, and IwS with lower compared to higher PAF generally showed increased lateral rotation (pâ<â.01); decreased maximal active humeral elevation (pâ<â.001); and more often tilting and winging (pâ<â.05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of these tests in clinical settings will allow for identification of altered scapular characteristics, which will enhance treatment planning for PAF post-stroke.

AB  - Background:  Pectoralis minor adaptive shortening may change scapula resting position and scapular kinematics during arm elevation. A reliable and clinically feasible method for measuring pectoralis minor length will be useful for clinical decision making when evaluating and treating individuals with shoulder pain and dysfunction.  Objectives:  To evaluate intrarater, interrater, and between-day reliability of a pectoralis minor (PM) muscle length measurement in subjects with and without signs of shoulder impingement.  Method:  A convenience sample of 100 individuals (50 asymptomatic and 50 symptomatic) participated in this study. Intra- and interrater reliability of the measurement was estimated in 50 individuals (25 asymptomatic and 25 symptomatic), and between-day reliability of the measurement repeated over an interval of 7 days was estimated in an independent sample of 50 additional participants. Pectoralis minor length was measured using a flexible tape measure with subjects standing.  Results:  Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC3,k) for intrarater and interrater reliability ranged from 0.86-0.97 and 0.95 for between-day reliability in both groups. Standard error of measurements (SEM) ranged from 0.30-0.42 cm, 0.70-0.84 cm, and 0.40-0.41 cm for intrarater, interrater, and between-day reliability, respectively, across the sample. The minimal detectable change (MDC) for between-day measurements ranged from 1.13-1.14 cm for both groups.  Conclusions:  In asymptomatic individuals and in those with signs of shoulder impingement, a single rater or pair of raters can measure pectoralis minor muscle length using a tape measure with very good reliability. This measurement can also be reliably used by the same rater over a seven day interval.

AB  - Patterns of cervical muscle activity may contribute to overuse injuries in office workers. The purpose of this investigation was to characterise patterns of upper trapezius muscle activity in pain-free office workers using traditional occupational exposure measures and a modified Active Amplitude Probability Distribution Function (APDF), which considers only periods of active muscle contraction. Bilateral trapezius muscle activity was recorded in 77 pain-free office workers for 1-2 full days in their natural work environment. Mean amplitude, gap frequency, muscular rest and Traditional and Active APDF amplitudes were calculated. All measures demonstrated fair to substantial reliability. Dominant muscles demonstrated higher amplitudes of activity and less muscular rest compared to non-dominant, and women demonstrated less muscular rest with no significant difference in amplitude assessed by Active APDF compared to men. These findings provide normative data to identify atypical motor patterns that may contribute to persistence or recurrence of neck pain in office workers. Practitioner Summary: Upper trapezius muscle activity was characterised in a large cohort of pain-free workers using electromyographic recordings from office environments. Dominant muscles demonstrated higher activity and less rest than non-dominant, and women demonstrated less rest than men. Results may be used to identify atypical trapezius muscle activity in office workers.

AB  - Accurate measurement of joint kinematics is required to understand the musculoskeletal effects of a therapeutic intervention such as upper extremity (UE) ergometry. Traditional surface-based motion capture is effective for quantifying humerothoracic motion, but scapular kinematics are challenging to obtain. Methods for estimating scapular kinematics include the widely-reported acromion marker cluster (AMC) which utilizes a static calibration between the scapula and the AMC to estimate the orientation of the scapula during motion. Previous literature demonstrates that including additional calibration positions throughout the motion improves AMC accuracy for single plane motions; however this approach has not been assessed for the non-planar shoulder complex motion occurring during UE ergometry. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of single, dual, and multiple AMC calibration methods during UE ergometry. The orientations of the UE segments of 13 healthy subjects were recorded with motion capture. Scapular landmarks were palpated at eight evenly-spaced static positions around the 360° cycle. The single AMC method utilized one static calibration position to estimate scapular kinematics for the entire cycle, while the dual and multiple AMC methods used two and four static calibration positions, respectively. Scapulothoracic angles estimated by the three AMC methods were compared with scapulothoracic angles determined by palpation. The multiple AMC method produced the smallest RMS errors and was not significantly different from palpation about any axis. We recommend the multiple AMC method as a practical and accurate way to estimate scapular kinematics during UE ergometry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pectoralis minor adaptive shortening may change scapula resting position and scapular kinematics during arm elevation. A reliable and clinically feasible method for measuring pectoralis minor length will be useful for clinical decision making when evaluating and treating individuals with shoulder pain and dysfunction. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate intrarater, interrater, and between-day reliability of a pectoralis minor (PM) muscle length measurement in subjects with and without signs of shoulder impingement. METHOD: A convenience sample of 100 individuals (50 asymptomatic and 50 symptomatic) participated in this study. Intra- and interrater reliability of the measurement was estimated in 50 individuals (25 asymptomatic and 25 symptomatic), and between-day reliability of the measurement repeated over an interval of 7 days was estimated in an independent sample of 50 additional participants. Pectoralis minor length was measured using a flexible tape measure with subjects standing. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC3,k) for intrarater and interrater reliability ranged from 0.86-0.97 and 0.95 for between-day reliability in both groups. Standard error of measurements (SEM) ranged from 0.30-0.42 cm, 0.70-0.84 cm, and 0.40-0.41 cm for intrarater, interrater, and between-day reliability, respectively, across the sample. The minimal detectable change (MDC) for between-day measurements ranged from 1.13-1.14 cm for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: In asymptomatic individuals and in those with signs of shoulder impingement, a single rater or pair of raters can measure pectoralis minor muscle length using a tape measure with very good reliability. This measurement can also be reliably used by the same rater over a seven day interval.

AB  - Several studies investigating myofascial pain syndrome include assessments of range of motion (ROM) as a diagnostic criterion. However, the value of ROM in this context has not yet been evaluated in controlled clinical studies. We aimed to examine whether patients with myofascial pain syndrome display alterations of ROM when compared to healthy subjects. Twenty-two individuals (13 females, 9 males; aged 33.4 ± 13.9 yrs) afflicted with active myofascial trigger points in the upper trapezius muscle as well as 22 age and sex matched healthy controls were included. All subjects underwent an examination of maximal active cervical ROM in flexion/extension assessed by means of a 3D ultrasonic movement analysis system (30 Hz; Zebris CMS 70). In the patients group, pressure pain threshold (PPT) of the trigger points was determined using a pressure algometer. Maximum range of motion in the sagittal plane did not differ between individuals with MTrP (125.9 ± 23.2°, 95% CI: 116.2-135.6°) and asymptomatic subjects (128.2 ± 20.4°, 95% CI: 119.7-136.7°; p > .05). In patients, PPT (1.7 ± .6, 95% CI: 1.5-1.9) was not correlated with cervical mobility (r = -.13; p > .05). Based on these pilot data, range of motion in flexion/extension is not a valid criterion for the detection of myofascial trigger points. Additional research incorporating movement amplitudes in other anatomical planes and additional afflicted muscles should be conducted in order to further delineate the relative impact of MTrP on range of motion.

AB  - The complexity of shoulder mechanics combined with the movement of skin relative to the scapula makes it difficult to measure shoulder kinematics with sufficient accuracy to distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Multibody skeletal models can improve motion capture accuracy by reducing the space of possible joint movements, and models are used widely to improve measurement of lower limb kinematics. In this study, we developed a rigid-body model of a scapulothoracic joint to describe the kinematics of the scapula relative to the thorax. This model describes scapular kinematics with four degrees of freedom: 1) elevation and 2) abduction of the scapula on an ellipsoidal thoracic surface, 3) upward rotation of the scapula normal to the thoracic surface, and 4) internal rotation of the scapula to lift the medial border of the scapula off the surface of the thorax. The surface dimensions and joint axes can be customized to match an individual's anthropometry. We compared the model to "gold standard" bone-pin kinematics collected during three shoulder tasks and found modeled scapular kinematics to be accurate to within 2 mm root-mean-squared error for individual bone-pin markers across all markers and movement tasks. As an additional test, we added random and systematic noise to the bone-pin marker data and found that the model reduced kinematic variability due to noise by 65% compared to Euler angles computed without the model. Our scapulothoracic joint model can be used for inverse and forward dynamics analyses and to compute joint reaction loads. The computational performance of the scapulothoracic joint model is well suited for real-time applications; it is freely available for use with OpenSim 3.2, and is customizable and usable with other OpenSim models.

AB  - The reliability of joint rotation measurements is an issue of major interest, especially in clinical applications. The effect of instrumental errors and soft tissue artifacts on the variability of human motion measures is well known, but the influence of the representation of joint motion has not yet been studied. The aim of the study was to compare the within-subject reliability of three rotation formalisms for the calculation of the shoulder elevation joint angles. Five repetitions of humeral elevation in the scapular plane of 27 healthy subjects were recorded using a stereophotogrammetry system. The humerothoracic joint angles were calculated using the YX'Y" and XZ'Y" Euler angle sequences and the attitude vector. A within-subject repeatability study was performed for the three representations. ICC, SEM and CV were the indices used to estimate the error in the calculation of the angle amplitudes and the angular waveforms with each method. Excellent results were obtained in all representations for the main angle (elevation), but there were remarkable differences for axial rotation and plane of elevation. The YX'Y" sequence generally had the poorest reliability in the secondary angles. The XZ'Y' sequence proved to be the most reliable representation of axial rotation, whereas the attitude vector had the highest reliability in the plane of elevation. These results highlight the importance of selecting the method used to describe the joint motion when within-subjects reliability is an important issue of the experiment. This may be of particular importance when the secondary angles of motions are being studied.

AB  - To describe shoulder motion the sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joint centres must be accurately located. Within the literature various methods to estimate joint centres of rotation location are proposed, with no agreement of the method best suited to the shoulder. The objective of this study was to determine the most reliable non-invasive method for locating joint centre locations of the shoulder complex. Functional methods using pin mounted markers were compared to anatomical methods, functional methods using skin mounted markers, imaging-based methods using CT-scan data, and regression equations. Three participants took part in the study, that involved insertion of intracortical pins into the clavicle, scapula and humerus, a CT-scan of the shoulder, and finally data collection using a motion analysis system. The various methods to estimate joint centre location did not all agree, however suggestions about the most reliable non-invasive methods could be made. For the sternoclavicular joint, the authors suggest the anatomical method using the most ventral landmark on the sternoclavicular joint, as recommended by the International Society of Biomechanics. For the acromioclavicular joint, the authors suggest the anatomical method using the landmark defined as the most dorsal point on the acromioclavicular joint, as proposed by van der Helm. For the glenohumeral joint, the simple regression equation of Rab is recommended.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Because of detachment of the pectoralis minor and variation of the vector of the conjoint tendons, we hypothesized that the Latarjet procedure may alter scapular position and motion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate scapular position and motion in patients who underwent a Latarjet or a modified iliac crest bone graft transfer (ICBGT) procedure (J-bone graft). METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients treated for recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation between 2010 and 2012 were retrospectively enrolled. Twenty-three were treated with a Latarjet and 23 with an ICBGT procedure. Twenty Latarjet and 20 ICBGT patients were available at a mean follow-up of 20 months (min, 12; max, 60). We recorded the Western Ontario Instability Index, the Rowe Score, and the Subjective Shoulder Value. Scapulothoracic position was studied according to the dyskinesis yes/no method. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability of the dyskinesis assessment was assessed. RESULTS: Intraobserver and interobserver reliability of scapula dyskinesis assessment was high (Latarjet: intratester, &#954; = 0.84; intertester, &#954; = 0.75; ICBGT: intratester, &#954; = 0.78; intertester, &#954; = 0.71). Scapular dyskinesis was observed after 5 of 20 Latarjet and after 0 of 20 ICBGT procedures (P = .047). Patients with dyskinesis had lower scores (Western Ontario Instability Index, P = .043; Rowe, P = .047; Subjective Shoulder Value, P = .046), but no statistically significant difference was found between the Latarjet and ICBGT groups. Two of the 5 scapular dyskinesis patients reached the SICK (Scapular malposition, Inferior medial scapular winging, Coracoid tenderness, and scapular dysKinesis) scapula syndrome definition. CONCLUSIONS: Scapular dyskinesis was found in 5 of 20 patients who underwent a Latarjet procedure. Dyskinesis may be related to the detachment of the pectoralis minor, and variation of the vector and the working length of the coracobrachialis and the short head of the biceps.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biomechanical studies have demonstrated that the lower trapezius (LT) facilitates normal shoulder function, and given its potential role in causing and/or perpetuating dysfunction, clinicians have begun to evaluate and rehabilitate the LT in the context of comprehensive shoulder rehabilitation programs. Although some studies have compared side-to-side differences in LT thickness among nonthrowers, no studies have been performed to examine the normal ultrasound appearance of the LT in the adolescent throwing population. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether LT thickness and cross-sectional area (CSA) differ between dominant and nondominant sides in adolescent baseball pitchers and to determine the inter-rater and intrarater reliability of the sonographically measured parameters. STUDY DESIGN: Observational, repeated measures study. SETTING: Hospital-based outpatient practice. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty asymptomatic male baseball pitchers aged 13-18 years with at least 3 years of pitching experience from a convenience sample in the Rochester, Minnesota, area. METHODS: LT thickness and CSA were measured at the T8 and T5 vertebral levels at rest, and thickness was measured again in active prone T- and Y-pose positions by multiple investigators. Side-to-side differences in thickness and CSA were examined, and inter-rater and intrarater measurement reliability coefficients were estimated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Thickness and cross-sectional area were measured. For reliability, we calculated intraclass correlation coefficients along with the standard error of measurement and the minimal detectable change. RESULTS: Resting LT thickness was 0.064 cm greater on the dominant side than on the nondominant side (P = .001). During contraction, LT thickness was 0.084 and 0.097 cm greater on the dominant side in the T and Y poses (P = .036 and P = .001, respectively). The CSA at the T5 level was 0.36 cm(2) greater on the dominant side than on the nondominant side (P < .001). Inter-rater and intrarater reliability coefficients exceeded 0.898 across all levels of measurement. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic adolescent pitchers have greater resting and contracted LT thickness and resting CSA on the dominant versus the nondominant side, although the quantitative differences are small. These differences suggest that structural changes and asymmetry can manifest at young ages; however, clinically, the nondominant arm can be used as a control in the adolescent pitching population. Ultrasound provides a noninvasive way to reliably evaluate LT thickness and CSA in adolescent pitchers.

AB  - Biomechanical measures are used to characterize the mechanisms of treatment for shoulder pain. The objective was to characterize test-retest reliability and measurement error of shoulder surface electromyographic(sEMG) and kinematic measures. Individuals(n = 12) with subacromial pain syndrome were tested at 2 visits. Five repetitions of shoulder scapular plane elevation were performed while collecting sEMG of the upper trapezius(UT), middle trapezius(MT), lower trapezius(LT), serratus anterior(SA) middle-deltoid, and infraspinatus muscles during ascending and descending phases. Simultaneously, electromagnetic sensors measured 3-dimensional kinematics of scapular internal/external rotation, upward/downward rotation, posterior/anterior tilt, and clavicular elevation/depression and clavicular protraction/retraction. Kinematic and sEMG variables were reduced for the total phase of ascending and descending elevation (30°-120°, 120°-30°), at 30° intervals for sEMG, and at every 30° discrete kinematic angle. The intraclass correlation coefficients(ICC) ranged from 0.08 to 0.99 for sEMG and 0.23-0.95 for kinematics. Correspondingly, the standard error of the measurement(SEM) and minimal detectable change(MDC) for sEMG measures varied from 2.3% to 103.8% of a reference contraction(REF-contraction). For kinematics, the SEM and MDC varied from 1.4° to 5.9°. Between-day reliability was good to very good, except for scapular internal/external rotation kinematics, and sEMG for the LT, UT, and SA. sEMG error values were highest (>25%REF-contraction) for most of the LT, UT, and SA variables. Kinematic error values indicate changes or differences of 2°-3° are meaningful, except for upward/downward rotation and internal/external rotation with MDCs of 4°-6°. Generally, data from the total phase of movement had better reliability and lower error than the data from sEMG interval or kinematic discrete angles.

AB  - Populations considered for shoulder analysis are often composed of various ratios of men and women. It is consequently hypothesized that gender has no significant effect on the joint kinematic. However, the literature reports, for the shoulder, differences in the range of motion between genders. The specific influence of gender on the scapulo-thoracic kinematics has not been studied yet. The dominant shoulder of two populations of men and women composed of 11 subjects each were evaluated in three dimensions for three distinct motions: flexion in the sagittal plane, abduction in the frontal plane and gleno-humeral internal/external rotation with the arm abducted at 90°. Posture, kinematics and range of motion were studied separately. For flexion and abduction and with regard to the scapular kinematic, external rotation was significantly larger for women than men. The differences were of at least 5° at 120° of humeral elevation. Upward rotations were identical. Women also showed larger average active humero-thoracic range of motion. The mean differences were of 13°, 7°, 12° and 5° for abduction, flexion, internal rotation and external rotation, respectively. No difference was observed between the scapular resting positions of both populations. The observed differences concerning both the scapular and humeral patterns would indicate that the shoulder behaviour of men and women should not be expected to be similar.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Overhead athletic activities and scapula dyskinesia are linked with shoulder pathology; pull-ups are a common training method for some overhead sports. Different pull-up techniques exist: anecdotally some are easier to perform, and others linked to greater incidences of pathology. This study aims to quantify scapular kinematics and external forces for three pull-up techniques, thus discussing potential injury implications. DESIGN: An observational study was performed with eleven participants (age=26.8±2.4 years) who regularly perform pull-ups. METHODS: The upward motions of three pull-up techniques were analysed: palms facing anterior, palms facing posterior and wide-grip. A skin-fixed scapula tracking technique with attached retro-reflective markers was used. RESULTS: High intra-participant repeatability was observed: mean coefficients of multiple correlations of 0.87-1.00 in humerothoracic rotations and 0.77-0.90 for scapulothoracic rotations. Standard deviations of hand force was low: <5% body weight. Significantly different patterns of humerothoracic, scapulothoracic and glenohumeral kinematics were observed between the pull-up techniques. The reverse technique has extreme glenohumeral internal-external rotation and large deviation from the scapula plane. The wide technique has a reduced range of pro/retraction in the same HT plane of elevation and 90° of arm abduction with 45° external rotation was observed. All these factors suggest increased sub-acromial impingement risk. CONCLUSIONS: The scapula tracking technique showed high repeatability. High arm elevation during pull-ups reduces sub-acromial space and increases pressure, increasing the risk of impingement injury. Wide and reverse pull-ups demonstrate kinematics patterns linked with increased impingement risk. Weight-assisted front pull-ups require further investigation and could be recommended for weaker participants.

AB  - The Constant-Murley score (CMS) is a popular measure of shoulder function. However, its ability to monitor the evolution of patients during rehabilitation after rotator-cuff repair is controversial. Moreover, CMS does not account for possible alterations in the scapulo-humeral coordination (SHC, scapula dyskinesis), which are apparent in variety of shoulder pathologies. To address these issues, a new formulation of CMS was firstly proposed, which rates the "affected-to-controlateral side difference in SHC" of a patient with respect to reference values of asymptomatic controls (Scapula-Weighted CMS). Then, 32 patients (53±9year-old) were evaluated with CMS and SW-CMS at 45, 70, 90-day and >6-month after rotator-cuff repair, to test three hypotheses: (1) CMS and SW-CMS are largely responsive to change; (2) accounting (SW-CMS) or not (CMS) for scapula dyskinesis leads to statistically different scores and SW-CMS cannot be predicted from CMS without clinically relevant differences; (3) 90% of patients recover a side-to-side SHC similar to asymptomatic controls at 90days. Results supported hypotheses 1 and 2. On the contrary (hypothesis 3), only 10% of patients recovered for SHC alterations at 90days, and 50% at follow-up. These findings support the use of SW-CMS and the importance of treating scapula dyskinesis after rotator-cuff repair.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) scans of the shoulder are often not well aligned to the axis of the scapula and glenoid. The purpose of this paper was to determine the effect of sagittal rotation of the glenoid on axial measurements of anterior-posterior (AP) glenoid width and glenoid version attained by standard CT scan. In addition, we sought to define the angle of rotation required to correct the CT scan to optimal positioning. METHODS: A total of 30 CT scans of the shoulder were reformatted using OsiriX software multiplanar reconstruction. The uncorrected (UNCORR) and corrected (CORR) CT scans were compared for measurements of both (1) axial AP glenoid width and (2) glenoid version at 5 standardized axial cuts. RESULTS: The mean difference in glenoid version was 2.6% (2° ± 0.1°; P = .0222) and the mean difference in AP glenoid width was 5.2% (1.2 ± 0.42 mm; P = .0026) in comparing the CORR and UNCORR scans. The mean angle of correction required to align the sagittal plane was 20.1° of rotation (range, 9°-39°; standard error of mean, 1.2°). CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that UNCORR CT scans of the glenohumeral joint do not correct for the sagittal rotation of the glenoid, and this affects the characteristics of the axial images. Failure to align the sagittal image to the 12-o'clock to 6-o'clock axis results in measurement error in both glenoid version and AP glenoid width. Use of UNCORR CT images may have notable implications for decision-making and surgical treatment.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of external rotation and active supination CT arthrography in postoperative evaluation by comparing it with neutral CT arthrography and analyzing its agreement with postoperative clinical results after the repair of type II superior labral anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 patients who had undergone CT arthrography in neutral, external rotation and active supination position at least 1 year after the arthroscopic repair of SLAP lesions were enrolled. Two radiologists independently evaluated the status of the repaired SLAP lesions with neutral CT arthrography and then with external rotation and active supination CT arthrography. RESULTS: Five patients had residual symptoms and positive findings upon SLAP-specific examinations. Agreements between the presence of symptoms and radiologic diagnoses based on neutral CT arthrography were insignificant for reader 1 (&#954; = 0.138, p = n.s.) and significant for reader 2 (&#954; = 0.328, p = 0.027). However, agreements were highly significant in the analysis following the evaluation of external rotation and active supination CT arthrography for both readers (&#954; = 0.694, p < 0.001 in reader 1; &#954; = 0.783, p < 0.001 in reader 2). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of contrast-filled gaps between the labrum and glenoid on neutral CT arthrography after SLAP repair is frequent with satisfactory clinical outcomes. Gaps without additional widening upon external rotation and active supination CT arthrography may suggest postoperatively stable biceps anchors, so this new method could minimize the overdiagnosis of recurrent SLAP lesions. Additional gap widening on external rotation and active supination CT arthrography could be related to a true recurrent SLAP lesion and the symptoms of the patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Case series, Level IV.

AB  - The shoulder complex presents unique challenges for measuring motion as the scapula, unlike any other bony segment in the body, glides and rotates underneath layers of soft tissue and skin. The ability for clinicians and researchers to collect meaningful kinematic data is dependent on the reliability and validity of the instrumentation utilized. The aim of this study was to review the relevant literature pertaining to the reliability and validity of electromagnetic tracking systems (ETS) and digital inclinometers for assessing shoulder complex motion. Advances in technology have led to the development of biomechanical instrumentation, like ETS, that allow for the collection of three-dimensional kinematic data. The existing evidence has demonstrated that ETS are reliable and valid instruments for collecting static and dynamic kinematic data of the shoulder complex. Similarly, digital inclinometers have become increasingly popular among clinicians due to their cost effectiveness and practical use in the clinical setting. The existing evidence supports the use of digital inclinometers for the collection of shoulder complex kinematics as these instruments have been demonstrated to yield acceptable reliability and validity. While digital inclinometers pose a disadvantage to ETS regarding accuracy, precision, and are limited to two-dimensional and static measurements, this instrument provides clinically meaningful data that allow clinicians and researchers the ability to measure, monitor, and compare shoulder complex kinematics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) is frequently used to diagnose glenoid bone defects in anterior shoulder instability. The assessment of glenoid defects on 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) CT scans has been reported with and without a comparative study of the contralateral shoulder; however, no previous studies have analyzed if these 4 methods agree. PURPOSE: To estimate agreement between CT assessments of glenoid defects by examination of the affected shoulder alone and by comparison with the contralateral side on both 2D and 3D CT scans. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A total of 200 prospectively enlisted patients affected by unilateral anterior shoulder instability underwent CT of both shoulders. The area of the missing glenoid was calculated on 4 sets of CT scans (2D and 3D CT images with and without comparison with the contralateral shoulder) by using the circle method. Agreement between the 4 measurements in quantifying the bone defect was estimated according to the Bland-Altman method. Agreement between the 4 measurements in assessing the presence and type of defect (fracture or erosion) was analyzed with &#954; statistics. RESULTS: Analysis of agreement between CT measurements in quantifying glenoid bone defects showed that the mean difference between the 4 measures was less than 1% of the area of the inferior glenoid in each pairwise comparison. Limits of agreement were always below the established acceptable limit of 5%. The assessment of the presence and type of bone defect showed strong to near-complete agreement between the 4 measurement methods. CONCLUSION: CT assessments of glenoid bone defects with and without comparison with the contralateral shoulder showed very good agreement in identifying the size, presence, and type of defect in patients with anterior shoulder instability on both 2D and 3D CT scans.

AB  - Objetivo. El propósito de este estudio es evaluar la validez interna de una prueba clínica descrita para el diagnóstico precoz de la capsulitis adhesiva de hombro: el Test de Distensión en Rotación Externa Pasiva (TDREP). Material y método. El TDREP se realiza con el paciente de pie, el brazo adducido y el codo flexionado a 90°. Desde esta posición, se inicia un movimiento suave de rotación externa pasiva, sosteniendo el brazo afectado con una mano del examinador en la muñeca y otra manteniendo el codo abducido hasta que se alcanza el punto máximo de rotación indolora. Desde este punto de máxima rotación externa con el brazo en aducción y sin dolor, se realiza un movimiento brusco de distensión, incrementando la rotación externa, causando dolor en el hombro si la prueba es positiva. Es test se realizó en un grupo de 155 pacientes con dolor de hombro de múltiples orígenes para analizar los valores predictivos, la sensibilidad, especificidad y razón de verosimilitud. Resultados. El TDREP mostró una sensibilidad de 100% (IC 95%, de 91,8 a 100%) y una especificidad del 90% (IC 95%, de 82,4 a 94,8%). El valor predictivo positivo fue de 0,62 y la razón de verosimilitud de 10,22 (IC 95%: 5,5 a 19,01). Los falsos positivos se encontraron solo en enfermos con tendinopatías del subescapular o con artrosis glenohumeral. Discusión. El TDREP tiene una alta sensibilidad para diagnosticar CA y cuando es negativo prácticamente la excluye. Los falsos positivos se pueden identificar fácilmente si existe una rotación externa sin limitación (tendinopatía subescapular) o con una radiografía simple de hombro (artrosis glenohumeral) (AU)
AB  - Objective. The aim of this study is to evaluate the internal validity of a clinical test for the early diagnosis of shoulder adhesive capsulitis, called the Distension Test in Passive External Rotation (DTPER). Material and method. The DTPER is performed with the patient standing up, the arm adducted, and the elbow bent at 90°. From this position, a smooth passive external rotation is started, the affected arm being supporting at the wrist with one hand of the examiner and the other maintaining the adducted elbow until the maximum painless point of the rotation is reached. From this point of maximum external rotation with the arm in adduction and with no pain, an abrupt distension movement is made, increasing the external rotation, causing pain in the shoulder if the test is positive. This term was performed on a group of patients with shoulder pain of many origins, in order to analyse the predictive values, sensitivity, specificity, and the likelihood ratio. Results. The DTPER showed a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI; 91.8 to 100%) and a specificity of 90% (95% CI; 82.4 to 94.8%). The positive predictive value was 0.62 and a likelihood ratio of 10.22 (95% CI; 5.5 to 19.01). False positives were only found in patients with subscapular tendinopathies or glenohumeral arthrosis. Discussion. The DTPER has a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis, and is excluded when it is practically negative. False positives can easily be identified if there is external rotation with no limits (subscapular tendinopathy) or with a simple shoulder X-ray (glenohumeral arthrosis) (AU)

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are many effective methods for decreasing the likelihood of repetitive strain injury (RSI) for those who work at a computer in an office environment. This study is focused on the highly repetitive task of interpreting seismic data. The skilled geoscientists who perform this work are very well compensated, and their work is vital to the success of the oil company. However, RSIs are still occurring in situations where effective methods of mitigating injuries have been successfully implemented and this has been occurring very frequently for geoscientists. This suggests that there are other elements contributing to the development of these injuries and one element could be the software interaction design. However, it is difficult for software designers to determine this because most measures associated with muscle activity require expensive data collection methods. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes research conducted to determine if survey-based subjective measures might be used to assess the potential for RSI for software programs. METHODS: In laboratory and field settings, data were collected using three different survey instruments (NASA-Task Load Index, Latko's Busiest Hand Activity Level Scale, and the Borg CR10 Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale) and conventional measures of muscle activity (sEMG). Correlations between the surveys and muscle activity were then calculated. RESULTS: For both the laboratory and the field, people were able to provide reliable self-report information related to their muscle activity. However, the effect sizes were not large. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that self-report tools could be utilized to identify software interaction designs related associated with risks of RSI.

AB  - Noninvasive methods enabling measurement of shoulder bone positions are paramount in clinical and ergonomics applications. In this study, the acromion marker cluster (AMC) method is assessed in comparison with a model-based approach allowing scapula tracking from low-dose biplanar radiograph images. Six healthy male subjects participated in this study. Data acquisition was performed for 6 arm abduction positions (0°, 45°, 90°, 120°, 150°, 180°). Scapula rotations were calculated using the coordinate systems and angle sequence was defined by the ISB. The comparison analysis was based on root mean square error (RMSE) calculation and nonparametric statistical tests. RMSE remained under 8° for 0° to 90° arm abduction and under 13.5° for 0° to 180° abduction; no significant differences were found between the 2 methods. Compared with previous works, an improved accuracy of the AMC approach at high arm abduction positions was obtained. This could be explained by the different sources of data used as the "gold standard."

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, blinded interrater reliability study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the interrater reliability of the modified Scapular Assistance Test (mSAT) with and without the use of additional handheld weights. METHODS: 110 Shoulder patients with various shoulder pathologies were consecutively recruited. Tests were performed independently and randomly on each participant by 2 different examiners, which were blinded to further clinical information (e.g. patient history, former diagnostic results). Percent agreement, Cohen's kappa (&#922;), proportion of positive/negative agreement, maximum &#922;, prevalence and bias indexes and prevalence-adjusted-bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) were calculated as estimates of interrater reliability of the mSAT with and without additional handheld weights. Weights were chosen according to body weight. RESULTS: The reliability measures for the mSAT (Cohen's &#922;: 0.68, confidence interval (CI): 0.51-0.85; PABAK: 0.78, CI: 0.67-0.90) as well as for the mSAT with handheld weights (Cohen's &#922;: 0.63, CI: 0.44-0.81; PABAK: 0.76, CI: 0.64-0.88) showed substantial agreement according to the classification system proposed by Landis and Koch. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, the mSAT with and without additional weights can be considered as reliable for clinical use. Since both tests showed substantial agreement, the use of additional handheld weights might not be necessary in case of obvious scapula dyskinesis. However, to perform the mSAT with/without additional weights should depend not only on its reliability values.

AB  - The purpose of this study was (1) to determine the relationships between the degree of forward scapular posture and the pectoralis minor index, the strength of the serratus anterior, the thoracic spine angle, and posterior shoulder tightness, and (2) to identify predictors of forward scapular posture, including posterior shoulder tightness. The study recruited eighteen subjects with forward scapular posture and objectively measured the acromion distance, the pectoralis minor index, and the strength of the serratus anterior muscle of each participant. The amount of glenohumeral horizontal adduction and internal rotation were evaluated to measure posterior shoulder tightness. There were high intra-rater reliabilities in all measurements. The measurement results showed a statistically strong negative correlation between the degree of forward scapular posture and the pectoralis minor index. They also revealed a moderate positive correlation between the degree of forward scapular posture and the thoracic spine angle and a moderate negative relationship between the degree of forward scapular posture and the amount of the glenohumeral horizontal adduction. A multiple regression analysis indicated that a total multiple regression model explained 93% of the amount of forward scapular posture. All predictor variables, including posterior shoulder tightness, should be considered while assessing, managing, and preventing forward scapular posture.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of ischemic compression (IC) versus placebo and control on reducing postneedling soreness of 1 latent myofascial trigger point and on improving cervical range of motion (CROM) in asymptomatic subjects. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 72-hour follow-up. SETTING: A university community. PARTICIPANTS: Asymptomatic volunteers (N = 90: 40 men and 50 women) aged 18 to 39 years (mean ± standard deviation [SD]: 22 ± 3 years). INTERVENTION: All subjects received a dry needling application over the upper trapezius muscle. Participants were then randomly divided into 3 groups: a treatment group who received IC over the needled trapezius muscle, a placebo group who received sham IC, and a control group who did not receive any treatment after needling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual analog scale (VAS; during needling, at posttreatment and 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours) and CROM (at preneedling, postneedling, and 24 and 72 hours). RESULTS: Subjects in the IC group showed significantly lower postneedling soreness than the placebo and the control group subjects immediately after treatment (mean ± standard deviation [SD]: IC, 20.1 ± 4.8; placebo, 36.7 ± 4.8; control, 34.8 ± 3.6) and at 48 hours (mean ± SD: IC, 0.6 ± 1; placebo, 4.8 ± 1; control, 3.8 ± 0.7). In addition, subjects in the dry needling+IC group showed significantly lower postneedling soreness duration (P = .026). All subjects significantly improved CROM in contralateral lateroflexion and both homolateral and contralateral rotations, but only the improvements found in the IC group reached the minimal detectable change. CONCLUSIONS: IC can potentially be added immediately after dry needling of myofascial trigger point in the upper trapezius muscle because it has the effect of reducing postneedling soreness intensity and duration. The combination of dry needling and IC seems to improve CROM in homolateral and contralateral cervical rotation movements.

AB  - It is suggested that scapular joint position sense (JPS) contributes to scapular stability. However, there is a lack of studies describing the measurement method for three-dimensional (3D) scapular JPS. The purposes of this study were to investigate the measurement repeatability and validity of the scapular JPS, and examine the effect of arm dominance on the scapular JPS in asymptomatic young adults. Ten subjects participated in this study. The scapular JPS was measured as scapular reposition errors during scapular elevation, depression, protraction, and retraction. Both the 3D scapular kinematics and clinical scale rule measurement were recorded during the test. The results showed that the measurement of scapular reposition errors resulted in moderate to excellent within-day intra-rater reliability with intraclass correlation coefficient ICC(3,2) between 0.60 and 0.99 for 3D scapular rotations, between 0.56 and 0.96 for 3D scapular displacement, and between 0.73 and 0.98 for the clinical scale ruler measurement. Scapular reposition errors measured using a 3D electromagnetic tracking device and using a scale ruler had a significant relationship (r=0.74-0.98). There was no significant difference in scapular reposition errors between the dominant and non-dominant shoulders. Our findings indicated that both the 3D tracking device and scale ruler resulted in a reliable measurement of scapular JPS and the clinical measurement method could be used to provide valid data for scapular JPS evaluation. In addition, arm dominance did not influence the scapular JPS in asymptomatic young adults.

AB  - The design of an industrial workstation tends to include ergonomic assessment steps based on a digital mock-up and a virtual reality setup. Lack of interaction and system fidelity is often reported as a main issue in such virtual reality applications. This limitation is a crucial issue as thorough ergonomic analysis is required for an investigation of the biomechanics. In the current study, we investigated the biomechanical responses of the shoulder joint in a simulated assembly task for comparison with the biomechanical responses in virtual environments. Sixteen male healthy novice subjects performed the task on three different platforms: real (RE), virtual (VE), and virtual environment with force feedback (VEF) with low and high precision demands. The subjects repeated the task 12 times (i.e., 12 cycles). High density electromyography from the upper trapezius and rotation angles of the shoulder joint were recorded and split into the cycles. The angular trajectories and velocity profiles of the shoulder joint angles over a cycle were computed in 3D. The inter-subject similarity in terms of normalized mutual information on kinematics and electromyography was investigated. Compared with RE the task in VE and VEF was characterized by lower kinematic maxima. The inter-subject similarity in RE compared with intra-subject similarity across the platforms was lower in terms of movement trajectories and greater in terms of trapezius muscle activation. The precision demand resulted in lower inter- and intra-subject similarity across platforms. The proposed approach identifies biomechanical differences in the shoulder joint in both VE and VEF compared with the RE platform, but these differences are less marked in VE mostly due to technical limitations of co-localizing the force feedback system in the VEF platform.

AB  - The measurement of dynamic scapular kinematics is complex due to the sliding nature of the scapula beneath the skin surface. The aim of the study was to clearly describe the acromion marker cluster (AMC) method of determining scapular kinematics when using a passive marker motion capture system, with consideration for the sources of error which could affect the validity and reliability of measurements. The AMC method involves placing a cluster of markers over the posterior acromion, and through calibration of anatomical landmarks with respect to the marker cluster it is possible to obtain valid measurements of scapular kinematics. The reliability of the method was examined between two days in a group of 15 healthy individuals (aged 19-38 years, eight males) as they performed arm elevation, to 120°, and lowering in the frontal, scapular and sagittal planes. Results showed that between-day reliability was good for upward scapular rotation (Coefficient of Multiple Correlation; CMC = 0.92) and posterior tilt (CMC = 0.70) but fair for internal rotation (CMC = 0.53) during the arm elevation phase. The waveform error was lower for upward rotation (2.7° to 4.4°) and posterior tilt (1.3° to 2.8°), compared to internal rotation (5.4° to 7.3°). The reliability during the lowering phase was comparable to results observed during the elevation phase. If the protocol outlined in this study is adhered to, the AMC provides a reliable measurement of upward rotation and posterior tilt during the elevation and lowering phases of arm movement.

AB  - CONTEXT: Proper scapular function during humeral elevation, such as upward rotation, external rotation, and posterior tilting of the scapula, is necessary to prevent shoulder injury. However, the appropriate intensity of rehabilitation exercise for the periscapular muscles has yet to be clarified. OBJECTIVE: To identify the serratus anterior, lower trapezius, infraspinatus, and posterior deltoid muscle activities during 2 free-motion exercises using 3 intensities and to compare these muscle activities with isometric contractions during quadruped shoulder flexion and external rotation and abduction of the glenohumeral joint. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Health Science Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 16 uninjured, healthy, active, male college students (age = 19.5 ± 1.2 years, height = 173.1 ± 6.5 cm, weight = 68.8 ± 6.6 kg). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Mean electromyographic activity normalized by the maximal voluntary isometric contraction was analyzed across 3 intensities and 5 exercises. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for electromyographic activity of the 4 muscles in each free-motion exercise. RESULTS: Significant interactions in electromyographic activity were observed between intensities and exercises (P < .05). The quadruped shoulder-flexion exercise activated all 4 muscles compared with other exercises. Also, the modified robbery free-motion exercise activated the serratus anterior, lower trapezius, and infraspinatus compared with the lawn-mower free-motion exercise. However, neither exercise showed a difference in posterior deltoid electromyographic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Three intensities exposed the nature of the periscapular muscle activities across the different exercises. The free-motion exercise in periscapular muscle rehabilitation may not modify serratus anterior, lower trapezius, and infraspinatus muscle activities unless knee-joint extension is limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment of the critical shoulder angle (CSA) is important in clinical evaluation of degenerative rotator cuff tears. This study analyzed the influence of radiographic viewing perspective on the CSA, developed a classification system to identify malpositioned radiographs, and assessed the relationship between the CSA and demographic factors. METHODS: Glenoid height, width, and retroversion were measured on 3-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions of 68 cadaver scapulae. A digitally reconstructed radiograph was aligned perpendicular to the scapular plane, and retroversion was corrected to obtain a true anteroposterior (AP) view. In 10 scapulae, incremental anteversion/retroversion and flexion/extension views were generated. The CSA was measured, and a clinically applicable classification system was developed to detect views with >2° change in CSA vs. true AP view. RESULTS: The average CSA was 33° ± 4°. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability was high (intraclass correlation coefficient &#8805; 0.81) but decreased with increasing viewing angle. Views beyond 5° anteversion, 8° retroversion, 15° flexion, and 26° extension resulted in >2° deviation of the CSA compared with the true AP view. The classification system was capable of detecting aberrant viewing perspectives with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 53%. Correlations between glenoid size and CSA were small (R &#8804; 0.3), and CSA did not vary by gender (P = .426) or side (P = .821). CONCLUSIONS: The CSA was most susceptible to malposition in anteversion/retroversion. Deviations as little as 5° in anteversion resulted in a CSA >2° from true AP view. A new classification system refines the ability to collect true AP radiographs of the scapula. The CSA was unaffected by demographic factors.

AB  - A robust and reproducible scapular coordinate system is necessary to study scapulothoracic kinematics. The coordinate system recommended by the ISB (International Society of Biomechanics) is difficult to apply in studies using medical imaging, which mostly use a glenoid-centered coordinate system. The aim of this study was to assess the robustness of a glenoid-centered coordinate system compared with the ISB coordinate system, and to study the reproducibility of this coordinate system measure during abduction. A Monte-Carlo analysis was performed to test the robustness of the two coordinate systems. This method enabled the variability of the orientation of the coordinate system to be assessed in a laboratory setting. A reproducibility study of the glenoid-centered coordinate system in the thorax reference frame was performed during abduction in the scapular plane using a low-dose stereoradiography system. We showed that the glenoid-centered coordinate system was slightly more robust than the ISB-recommended coordinate system. Most reproducible rotation was upward/downward rotation (x axis) and most reproducible translation was along the Y axis (superior-inferior translation). In conclusion, the glenoid-centered coordinate system can be used with confidence for scapular kinematics analysis. The uncertainty of the measures derived from our technique is acceptable compared with that reported in the literature. Functional quantitative analysis of the scapulothoracic joint is possible with this method.

AB  - The participation of scapula motion in arm movement is clinically well known and recent three dimensional (3D) analyses using kinematic techniques have confirmed its importance. Scapular motion relative to the thorax has a theoretical maximum of 6 degrees of freedom (DoF), resulting from rotations at both clavicular joints (3 rotational DoF each). However, most recent kinematic studies have only analysed the 3D rotations of the scapula relative to the thorax. In the present study, the 3D translations of the barycentre of the scapula were considered in order to complete the description of movement at the shoulder complex. Eight healthy subjects performed arm elevation in the sagittal and frontal planes, simulated activities of daily living (hair combing and back washing) and maximum voluntary scapula movement (forward and backward rolling). Measurements were recorded using a 6 DoF electromagnetic device and the acromial method of analysis was used. The results showed that 3D scapular rotations and translation of its barycentre were functionally consistent for all tasks. A principal component analysis (PCA) yielded three factors, explaining 97.6% of the variance. The first two factors (protraction and shrug, according to clinical descriptions) combined rotations and translations, consistent with the hypothesis that the scapula rolls over the curved thoracic surface. The third factor related to lateral-medial rotation, thus representing rotation in the plane tangential to the thorax. The PCA suggested that scapular motion can be described using these 3 DoF. This should be studied in a larger group of individuals, including patients with pathological conditions.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the potential of employing a classification tool to objectively classify participants with clinically assessed movement faults (MFs) of the scapula. Six participants with a history of shoulder pain with MFs of the scapula and 12 healthy participants with no movement faults (NMFs) performed a flexion movement control test of the scapula, while scapular kinematic data were collected. Principal component scores and discrete kinematic variables were used as input into a classifier. Five out of the six participants with a history of pain were successfully classified as having scapular MFs with an accuracy of 72%. Variables related to the upward rotation of the scapula had the most influence on the classification. The results of the study demonstrate the potential of adopting a multivariate approach in objective classification of participants with altered scapular kinematics in pathological groups.

AB  - Midcarpal instability syndrome is often misdiagnosed, leading to delayed recognition, treatment and possibly poor clinical outcome. Four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) has previously proved useful in assessment of the acromioclavicular joint and wrist motion, allowing clinicians and radiologists to gain an understanding of abnormalities in function as well as morphology, which often contribute to patient symptoms. We present the case of a 25-year-old male with no history of trauma who presents with several months of a right wrist clunk on both passive and active (load bearing) motion. Plain film and 1.5 Tesla MRI with intra-articular contrast demonstrates a normal appearance, without joint space, tendon or ligament disturbance. We further investigated this condition using a wide volume detector CT scanning technique (4D CT). Data from the patient's asymptomatic wrist was utilized as a comparison for this study. Assessment of cine movie files from the symptomatic wrist revealed abnormal subluxation of the capitate from the lunate when compared with the normal wrist, in which the capitate did not deviate from the concavity of the lunate and did not cross the perpendicular line from the superior pole of the lunate in any phase of motion, which we defined as capitate subluxation. 4D CT allows for detection of capitate subluxation in an earlier stage of disease progression, constituting earlier recognition and providing the opportunity for earlier treatment of the disease, potentially mitigating significant patient morbidity. We have been able to confidently identify capitate subluxation both visually (assessment of the sagittal RLC axis) and objectively (documentation of percent subluxation of the capitate beyond the superior pole of the lunate). We propose that 4D CT investigation of all functional carpal instability syndromes may be beneficial as this technique has the potential to significantly increase our knowledge of dynamic carpal bone abnormalities.

AB  - Upper limb (UL) kinematic assessment protocols are becoming integrated into clinical practice due to their development over the last few years. We propose the ELEPAP UL protocol, a contemporary UL kinematic protocol that can be applied to different pathological conditions. This model is based on ISB modeling recommendations, uses functional joint definitions, and models three joints of the shoulder girdle. The specific aim of this study was to determine the within and between session reliability of the ELEPAP UL model. Ten healthy subjects (mean age: 13.6±4.3 years) performed four reach-to-grasp and five functional tasks, which included a novel throwing task to assess a wide spectrum of motor skills. Three trials of every task in two different sessions were analyzed. The reliability of angular waveforms was evaluated by measurement error (&#963;) and coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC). Spatiotemporal parameters were assessed by standard error of measurement (SEM). Generally joint kinematics presented low &#963;w and &#963;b errors (<100). A selection of angular waveforms errors was presented to inspect error fluctuation in different phases, which was found to be related to the demands of the different movements. CMCw and CMCb values (>0.60) were found, demonstrating good to excellent reliability especially in joints with larger ranges of motion. The throwing task proved equally reliable, enhancing the universal application of the protocol. Compared to the literature, this study demonstrated higher reliability of the thorax, scapula and wrist joints. This was attributed to the highly standardized procedure and the implementation of recent methodological advancements. In conclusion, ELEPAP protocol was proved a reliable tool to analyze UL kinematics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of scapular dyskinesis (SD) is of clinical interest, as SD is believed to be related to shoulder pathology. However, no clinical assessment with sufficient reliability to identify SD and provide treatment strategies is available. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of the comprehensive SD classification method. DESIGN: Cross-sectional reliability study. METHOD: Sixty subjects with unilateral shoulder pain were evaluated by two independent physiotherapists with a visual-based palpation method. SD was classified as single abnormal scapular pattern [inferior angle (pattern I), medial border (pattern II), superior border of scapula prominence or abnormal scapulohumeral rhythm (pattern III)], a mixture of the above abnormal scapular patterns, or normal pattern (pattern IV). The assessment of SD was evaluated as subjects performed bilateral arm raising/lowering movements with a weighted load in the scapular plane. Percentage of agreement and kappa coefficients were calculated to determine reliability. RESULTS: Agreement between the 2 independent physiotherapists was 83% (50/60, 6 subjects as pattern III and 44 subjects as pattern IV) in the raising phase and 68% (41/60, 5 subjects as pattern I, 12 subjects as pattern II, 12 subjects as pattern IV, 12 subjects as mixed patterns I and II) in the lowering phase. The kappa coefficients were 0.49-0.64. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the visual-based palpation classification method for SD had moderate to substantial inter-rater reliability. The appearance of different types of SD was more pronounced in the lowering phase than in the raising phase of arm movements.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Scapular motion during arm elevation is frequently evaluated in patients with shoulder disorders because it provides clinically useful information. With the development of measurement devices and improvement in accuracy, comparisons under various conditions have recently been reported. However, in most of these reports, the subjects examined were limited to males, or a mixed population of males and females. Only a few reports have described sex differences. In the current study, we performed three-dimensional dynamic analysis of arm elevation and investigated whether there is a sex difference in scapular motion. METHODS: Subjects included 18 healthy adult males (18 shoulders) and 19 healthy adult females (19 shoulders). Thirty-seven shoulders were on the dominant side. The age range was 20.5 ± 0.03 years. Subjects performed scapular plane arm elevation, and kinematic data were recorded using an electromagnetic tracking device. Scapular upward rotation and internal rotation angles and the posterior tilt angle accompanying arm elevation were calculated from recorded data. Changes in each angle during scapular motion were recorded according to sex. RESULTS: There were sex differences in scapular upward rotation and internal rotation angles. The upward rotation angle was significantly greater in males, whereas the internal rotation angle was significantly greater in females. No sex differences were noted in the scapular posterior tilt angle. DISCUSSION: Findings of this study may serve as basic data for scapular motion during scapular plane elevation in healthy males and females. In addition, it is necessary to evaluate and treat the shoulder while taking sex differences in scapular movement into consideration.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability of using freehand three-dimensional ultrasound to measure scapular rotations (internal/external, upward/downward, anterior/posterior). The scapular position in 22 healthy, nondisabled individuals was imaged three times in four testing positions of interest (arm at rest and humeral elevation in the sagittal, frontal, and scapular planes). We found substantial reliability across scanning positions and scapular rotations, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.62 to 0.95. The highest reliability was found in the rest testing position. Our standard error of measurement was less than 2 degrees for all measurements and less than 0.5 degrees for most. Minimum detectable change ranged from 0.37 to 3.08 degrees. Our results agree with the pattern of movement found in other studies, with the scapula moving toward a more externally rotated, upwardly rotated, and posteriorly tilted position with humeral elevation. Further study is warranted to compare our methods to a gold standard, apply them to evaluating dynamic movement, and determine whether they can be used to detect shoulder pathology.

AB  - Context :  Proper scapular function during humeral elevation, such as upward rotation, external rotation, and posterior tilting of the scapula, is necessary to prevent shoulder injury. However, the appropriate intensity of rehabilitation exercise for the periscapular muscles has yet to be clarified. Objective :  To identify the serratus anterior, lower trapezius, infraspinatus, and posterior deltoid muscle activities during 2 free-motion exercises using 3 intensities and to compare these muscle activities with isometric contractions during quadruped shoulder flexion and external rotation and abduction of the glenohumeral joint. Design :  Cross-sectional study. Setting :  Health Science Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants :  A total of 16 uninjured, healthy, active, male college students (age = 19.5 ± 1.2 years, height = 173.1 ± 6.5 cm, weight = 68.8 ± 6.6 kg). Main Outcome Measure(s) :  Mean electromyographic activity normalized by the maximal voluntary isometric contraction was analyzed across 3 intensities and 5 exercises. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for electromyographic activity of the 4 muscles in each free-motion exercise. Results :  Significant interactions in electromyographic activity were observed between intensities and exercises (P < .05). The quadruped shoulder-flexion exercise activated all 4 muscles compared with other exercises. Also, the modified robbery free-motion exercise activated the serratus anterior, lower trapezius, and infraspinatus compared with the lawn-mower free-motion exercise. However, neither exercise showed a difference in posterior deltoid electromyographic activity. Conclusions :  Three intensities exposed the nature of the periscapular muscle activities across the different exercises. The free-motion exercise in periscapular muscle rehabilitation may not modify serratus anterior, lower trapezius, and infraspinatus muscle activities unless knee-joint extension is limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic tracking systems have enabled some investigators and clinicians to measure tri-planar scapular motion; yet, they are not practical and affordable options for all clinicians. Currently, the ability to affordably quantify scapular motion is limited to monitoring only the motion of scapular upward rotation, with use of a digital inclinometer. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine the criterion-related validity of a modified digital inclinometer when used to measure the motion of scapular anterior-posterior (AP) tilt. MATERIALS & METHODS: Thirteen volunteers, free from any history of shoulder injury, reported for a single testing session. Each subject underwent a brief shoulder and posture examination in order to confirm the absence of pathology. Subjects actively performed clinically relevant amounts of humeral elevation in the scapular plane while in a seated position. An electromagnetic tracking system (Ascension Technology, Burlington, VT) and a modified inclinometer (Pro 360, Baseline®, Fabrication Enterprises, White Plains, NY) were used to acquire scapular AP tilt over the same shoulder motions. Criterion-related validity was determined using Pearson Product Moment correlations. RESULTS: Correlation analyses revealed significant moderate to good associations (r = 0.63 to 0.86, p < 0.01) between scapular AP tilt measures obtained with a digital inclinometer and an electromagnetic tracking system. CONCLUSIONS: A modified digital inclinometer is a moderately valid device to use for the quantification of scapular AP tilt. Further study is warranted to establish reliability and to validate use of the device in patients with shoulder injury or pathology. The modified inclinometer expands the clinician's ability to quantify scapular kinematic motion during the clinical evaluation and rehabilitation process. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3.

AB  - To direct interventions aimed at improving scapular position and motion in shoulder pathologies, a clinically feasible, objective, sensitive and reliable assessment of scapular dyskinesis is needed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the intra- and inter-observer reliability and the precision of 3D scapula kinematics measurement using wireless sensors of an inertial and magnetic measurement system (IMMS). Scapular kinematics during humerus anteflexion and abduction of 20 subjects without shoulder pathologies were measured twice by two observers at two different days, using IMMS. Similar movement patterns and corresponding high intraclass correlation coefficients were found within (intra) and between (inter) observers, especially for scapular retraction/protraction (0.65-0.85) and medio/lateral rotation (0.56-0.91). Lowest reliability and highest difference in range of motion were observed for anterior/posterior tilt. Medio/lateral rotation and anterior/posterior tilt showed a high precision, with standard error of measurement being mostly below 5°. The inter-observer measurements of retraction/protraction showed lowest precision, reflected in systematic differences. This is caused by an offset in anatomical calibration of the sensors. IMMS enables easy and objective measurement of 3D scapula kinematics. Further research in a patient population should focus on clinical feasibility and validity for measurement of scapular dyskinesis. This would include the application of a scapula locator to enhance anatomical calibration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glenohumeral displacements assessment would help to design shoulder prostheses with physiological arthrokinematics and to establish more biofidelic musculoskeletal models. Though displacements were documented during static tasks, there is little information on their 3D coupling with glenohumeral angle during dynamic tasks. Our objective was to characterize the 3D glenohumeral displacement-rotation couplings during dynamic arm elevations and rotations. METHODS: Glenohumeral displacements were measured from trajectories of reflective markers fitted on intracortical pins inserted into the scapula and humerus. Bone geometry was recorded using CT-scan. Only four participants were recruited to the experiment due to its invasiveness. Participants performed dynamic arm abduction, flexion and axial rotations. Linear regressions were performed between glenohumeral displacements and rotations. The pin of the scapula of one participant moved, his data were removed from analysis, and results are based on three participants. FINDINGS: The measurement error of glenohumeral kinematics was less than 0.15mm and 0.2°. Maximum glenohumeral displacements were measured along the longitudinal direction and reached up to +12.4mm for one participant. Significant couplings were reported especially between longitudinal displacement and rotation in abduction (adjusted R(2) up to 0.94). INTERPRETATION: The proposed method provides the potential to investigate glenohumeral kinematics during all kinds of movements. A linear increase of upward displacement during dynamic arm elevation was measured, which contrasts with results based on a series of static poses. The systematic investigation of glenohumeral displacements under dynamic condition may help to provide relevant recommendation for the design of shoulder prosthetic components and musculoskeletal models.

AB  - Electromagnetic systems for motion analysis are claimed as a precise technique for tracking position and orientation of human body segments. To date, reliability electromagnetic tracking was described only for the dynamic assessment of the scapula motion, and no reliability studies on its resting posture or positioning were found. The aim of this study was to analyze intra- and inter-session reliabilities and absolute errors of the scapular orientation and position at habitual resting posture in healthy individuals. Twenty-two shoulder symptom-free individuals non participants in professional or recreational sports activities involving upper extremities were volunteers in this study. The equipment used was 3SPACE Liberty system (Polhemus Inc.). The same examiner collected the kinematic data from subjects in two different sessions, with an interval from seven to ten days. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC2,1 and ICC2, k) and Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) were calculated. Inter-session reliability ranged from good to excellent (ICC from 0.66 to 0.96) and intra-session reliability was excellent (ICC &#8805; 0.97). SEM values found for linear distances were smaller than 0.02 cm and scapular rotations ranged from 0.72° to 5.48°. Results of this study demonstrated that electromagnetic data acquisition of scapula habitual posture is a reliable tool for defining scapular position and orientation in sedentary shoulder symptom-free individuals.
AB  - Sistemas eletromagnéticos para análise de movimento são conhecidos como precisos para registrar a posição e orientação dos segmentos do corpo humano. Até o momento, a confiabilidade do registro eletromagnético foi descrita apenas para a dinâmica da escápula, não sendo encontrados estudos de confiabilidade da posição de repouso ou postura da mesma. O objetivo deste estudo foi a análise da confiabilidade intra- e inter-sessão e erros absolutos do registro eletromagnético da posição e orientação da escápula na postura habitual de repouso de indivíduos saudáveis. Foram voluntários no estudo 22 indivíduos sem sintomas no complexo articular do ombro e não-praticantes amadores ou profissionais de esporte e atividade física envolvendo os membros superiores. O equipamento utilizado foi o sistema 3SPACE Liberty (Polhemus Inc.). Um mesmo avaliador coletou os dados cinemáticos em duas sessões diferentes com um intervalo de sete a dez dias. O Coeficiente de Correlação Intraclasse (ICC2,1 e ICC2,k) e o Erro Padrão de Medida (EPM) foram calculados. A confiabilidade inter-sessão variou entre boa a excelente (ICC de 0,66 a 0,96) e a confiabilidade intra-sessão foi sempre excelente (ICC &#8805; 0,97). Os valores de EPM encontrados para as distâncias lineares foram menores que 0,02 cm e para as rotações da escápula relativa ao tórax variaram entre 0,72 º e 5,48 º. Os resultados deste estudo demonstraram que o registro eletromagnético da posição habitual de repouso da escápula é confiável para determinar a posição e a orientação da mesma em um população sedentária e sem sintomas no complexo articular do ombro.

AB  - Accurate representation of individual scapula kinematics and subject geometries is vital in musculoskeletal models applied to upper limb pathology and performance. In applying individual kinematics to a model's cadaveric geometry, model constraints are commonly prescriptive. These rely on thorax scaling to effectively define the scapula's path but do not consider the area underneath the scapula in scaling, and assume a fixed conoid ligament length. These constraints may not allow continuous solutions or close agreement with directly measured kinematics. A novel method is presented to scale the thorax based on palpated scapula landmarks. The scapula and clavicle kinematics are optimised with the constraint that the scapula medial border does not penetrate the thorax. Conoid ligament length is not used as a constraint. This method is simulated in the UK National Shoulder Model and compared to four other methods, including the standard technique, during three pull-up techniques (n=11). These are high-performance activities covering a large range of motion. Model solutions without substantial jumps in the joint kinematics data were improved from 23% of trials with the standard method, to 100% of trials with the new method. Agreement with measured kinematics was significantly improved (more than 10° closer at p<0.001) when compared to standard methods. The removal of the conoid ligament constraint and the novel thorax scaling correction factor were shown to be key. Separation of the medial border of the scapula from the thorax was large, although this may be physiologically correct due to the high loads and high arm elevation angles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scapular dyskinesis is observed in subjects with pathologic conditions of the shoulder; however, there is limited information about the factors related to scapular dyskinesis among participants in rugby. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence, reliability, and relationships between scapular dyskinesis and variables related to the shoulder in high-school rugby players. METHODS: A total of 164 Japanese high-school rugby players were evaluated with questionnaires, physical examinations, and a video analysis during their preseason. After evaluation of the inter-rater reliability of a classification of scapular dyskinesis, the outcomes were analyzed to assess the relationships between scapular dyskinesis and other variables during the preseason. The data were assessed with a logistic regression analysis calculating the odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: The inter-rater reliability among 3 blinded observers based on the Fleiss &#954; value and percentage agreement was .52 and 79.0%, respectively, which indicates that the method is moderately reliable. Scapular dyskinesis was identified in 16 (10.1%) shoulders among 159 players, with type I being prominent. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a type I dyskinesis was significantly associated with a past history of stingers with projected pain to the affected side of the shoulder (OR, 3.7) and the player's competitive grade at the time of the survey (OR, 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: Scapular dyskinesis is significantly associated with a past history of stingers. This suggests that stingers are a causative factor of scapular dyskinesis in the rugby population. Our method of evaluating scapular dyskinesis in collision athletes exhibits moderate reliability.

AB  - Methods based on cutaneous markers are the most popular for the recording of three dimensional scapular motion analysis. Numerous methods have been evaluated, each showing different levels of accuracy and reliability. The aim of this review was to report the metrological properties of 3D scapular kinematic measurements using cutaneous markers and to make recommendations based on metrological evidence. A database search was conducted using relevant keywords and inclusion/exclusion criteria in 5 databases. 19 articles were included and assessed using a quality score. Concurrent validity and reliability were analyzed for each method. Six different methods are reported in the literature, each based on different marker locations and post collection computations. The acromion marker cluster (AMC) method coupled with a calibration of the scapula with the arm at rest is the most studied method. Below 90-100° of humeral elevation, this method is accurate to about 5° during arm flexion and 7° during arm abduction compared to palpation (average of the 3 scapular rotation errors). Good to excellent within-session reliability and moderate to excellent between-session reliability have been reported. The AMC method can be improved using different or multiple calibrations. Other methods using different marker locations or more markers on the scapula blade have been described but are less accurate than AMC methods. Based on current metrological evidence we would recommend (1) the use of an AMC located at the junction of the scapular spine and the acromion, (2) the use of a single calibration at rest if the task does not reach 90° of humeral elevation, (3) the use of a second calibration (at 90° or 120° of humeral elevation), or multiple calibrations above 90° of humeral elevation.

AB  - A major benefit of computational modeling in biomechanics research is its ability to estimate internal muscular demands given limited input information. However, several assumptions regarding model parameters and constraints may influence model outputs. This research evaluated the influence of model parameter variability, specifically muscle attachment locations and glenohumeral stability thresholds, on predicted rotator cuff muscle force during internal and external axial humeral rotation tasks. Additionally, relative sensitivity factors assessed which parameters were more contributory to output variability. Modest model parameter variation resulted in considerable variability in predicted force, with origin-insertion locations being particularly influential. Specifically, the scapula attachment site of the subscapularis muscle was important for modulating predicted force, with sensitivity factors ranging from &#945;=0.2 to 0.7 in a neutral position. The largest variability in predicted forces was present for the subscapularis muscle, with average differences of 33.0±9.6% of normalized muscle force (1-99% CI), and a maximal difference of 51% in neutral exertions. Infraspinatus and supraspinatus muscles elicited maximal differences of 15.0 and 20.6%, respectively, between confidence limits. Overall, origin and insertion locations were most influential and thus incorporating geometric variation in the prediction of rotator cuff muscle forces may provide more representative population estimates.

AB  - UNLABELLED: A total of 11 male and 19 female violinists performed 30-second random-ordered slow and fast musical repertoire while right shoulder three-dimensional kinematic, and upper trapezius and serratus anterior surface electromyography (EMG) data were summarised using exposure variation analysis (EVA), a bivariate distribution of work time spent at categories of signal amplitude, and duration spent at a fixed category of amplitude. Sixty-two per cent of intraclass correlation coefficients [1,1] for all kinematic and EMG variables exceeded 0.75, and 40% of standard error of the measurement results were below 5%, confirming EVA reliability. When fast repertoire was played, increases in odds ratios in short duration cells were seen in 23 of 24 possible instances, and decreases in longer duration cells were seen in 17 instances in all EVA arrays using multinomial logistic regression with random effects, confirming a shift towards shorter duration. A reliable technique to assess right shoulder kinematic and EMG exposure in violinists was identified. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: A reliable method of measuring right shoulder motion and muscle activity exposure variation in violinists was developed which can be used to assess ergonomic risk in other occupations. Recently developed statistical methods enabled differentiation between fast and slow musical performance of standardised musical repertoire.

AB  - The aims were to compile a schematic overview of clinical scapular assessment methods and critically appraise the methodological quality of the involved studies. A systematic, computer-assisted literature search using Medline, CINAHL, SportDiscus and EMBASE was performed from inception to October 2013. Reference lists in articles were also screened for publications. From 50 articles, 54 method names were identified and categorized into three groups: (1) Static positioning assessment (n = 19); (2) Semi-dynamic (n = 13); and (3) Dynamic functional assessment (n = 22). Fifteen studies were excluded for evaluation due to no/few clinimetric results, leaving 35 studies for evaluation. Graded according to the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN checklist), the methodological quality in the reliability and validity domains was "fair" (57%) to "poor" (43%), with only one study rated as "good". The reliability domain was most often investigated. Few of the assessment methods in the included studies that had "fair" or "good" measurement property ratings demonstrated acceptable results for both reliability and validity. We found a substantially larger number of clinical scapular assessment methods than previously reported. Using the COSMIN checklist the methodological quality of the included measurement properties in the reliability and validity domains were in general "fair" to "poor". None were examined for all three domains: (1) reliability; (2) validity; and (3) responsiveness. Observational evaluation systems and assessment of scapular upward rotation seem suitably evidence-based for clinical use. Future studies should test and improve the clinimetric properties, and especially diagnostic accuracy and responsiveness, to increase utility for clinical practice.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Glenoid component loosening comprises 25 % of all complications related to total shoulder arthroplasties (TSA). This prospective study was undertaken to assess the accuracy of an uncemented metal-back glenoid component in cases of revision of aseptic glenoid loosening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between September 2007 and January 2010, a total of ten patients with symptomatic glenoid loosening after TSA (7 cemented and 3 non-cemented) underwent revision surgery with an uncemented metal-back glenoid component (MB). The rotator cuff was functional in all cases. The reconstruction of the glenoid was obtained using an iliac crest graft (8 patients) or synthetic bone substitute (2 patients). The non-cemented glenoid component was fixed into the glenoid native bone, thus stabilizing the graft reconstruction. A clinical and radiological checkup was performed at the long-term follow-up and compared with the preoperative values. The patients were also asked to quantify their pain and satisfaction. RESULTS: There were no intraoperative complications. In all cases, the radiological evaluation showed a good integration of the bone graft with no radiolucency or new glenoid loosening. In one patient, the revision surgery was indicated for the dissociation between MB and polyethylene. After more than 2 years of follow-up, all patients were satisfied or highly satisfied with the outcomes. The pain VAS score (0-10) decreased from 5.1 to 0.6 (p < 0.001). The simple shoulder test increased from 3.4 to 7.9 points (gain 4.5; p < 0.001). The Constant and Murley score increased from 39.4 to 71 points (gain 31.6; p < 0.001). The gain in anterior elevation was 31°, from 118° to 149° (p < 0.001). External rotation elbow to the body (ER1) increased from an average of 34° preoperatively to 47° after surgery (p < 0.001) and external rotation at 90° of abduction from 43° to 66° (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that revision with a non-cemented glenoid component associated with a bone graft can solve the difficult challenge of glenoid loosening, provided that the rotator cuff is functional and the glenoid is reconstructable. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE AND STUDY TYPE: Cohort studies (prospective) without controls, Level IV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasonography (US) and MRI findings in hemiplegic patients with shoulder pain and investigate the correlation between them. It is not possible for these patients to fully perform active range of motion (ROM) and stress tests, so imaging methods take center stage in diagnosis and treatment planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 68 hemiplegic patients with shoulder pain attending the inpatient rehabilitation program were included in the study. MRI and US results from the patient files were recorded. The frequency of each pathology identified by US and MRI was determined. The distribution of MRI and US findings was investigated to see whether there was a statistical difference between the correlation of MRI and US results. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the patients was 63.7 (8.3) years and the mean (SD) duration of hemiplegia was 49 (8.9) days. According to the MRI results, glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint degeneration was found in 77.9% and 79.7% of the patients, respectively; subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis in 80.9%; fluid increase in the joint space in 41.2%; supraspinatus tendinitis in 36.8%; and supraspinatus partial rupture in 33.8%. Shoulder US findings were supraspinatus tendinitis in 54.4%, acromioclavicular joint degeneration in 26.5%, bicipital tendinitis in 20.6%, and subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis in 19.1%. There was a statistically significant difference between MRI and US findings. The results were not compatible with each other (P â¯ .05), and these findings were not consistent with each other since the kappa coefficient was under 0.40 for all these results. CONCLUSION: Although US is recommended as the first method in determining shoulder pathologies in hemiplegic patients, we suggest that MRI should be used as the first choice in hemiplegic patients with shoulder pain. MRI and US findings were not consistent, and US is dependent on the experience of the operator. MRI should be the first choice in cases where the diagnosis will affect the treatment choice due to the lack of correlation between US and MRI findings.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic clavicular resection is a common procedure, but few studies have analyzed predictive factors for outcome. HYPOTHESES: 1) Computed tomography (CT) of clavicular resection is reproductible; 2) Functional outcome correlates with resection length; 3) Other factors also influence outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients operated on between 2005 and 2010 were called back to establish functional scores (Constant, Simple Shoulder Test [SST], satisfaction) and undergo low-dose bilateral comparative computed tomography (CT) centered on the acromioclavicular joints. The assessment criteria were resection edge parallelism and resection length, measured using OsiriX software. Radiological and clinical data were correlated. RESULTS: 18 out of 21 patients (85%: 3 female, 15 male) were assessed. Mean age at surgery was 49 years (range, 40-62 yrs); mean follow-up was 4.2 years (1.6-7.2 yrs). Mean Constant score rose from 57.7 (25-85) to 70.2 (30-96); mean postoperative SST was 9.3 (3-12). 11 patients had very good and 4 poor results. CT resection length was reproducible, with intraclass, intra- and interobserver correlation coefficients >95%. There was no significant correlation between articular resection length on CT and functional scores (P=0.2). Functional scores were negatively influenced by an occupational pathologic context (P<0.01) and by associated tendinopathy. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Low-dose CT enabled reproducible analysis of clavicular resection. The hypothesized correlation between resection length and functional result was not confirmed. Work accidents and occupational disease emerged as risk factors. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Single-center retrospective analytic cohort study. Level 4, guideline grade C.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Clinical measurement. OBJECTIVE: To establish trial-to-trial within-day and between-day reliability, standard error of measurement, and minimal detectable change of scapular orientation during elevation and lowering of the arm, and with the arm relaxed at the side, in individuals with and without shoulder impingement. BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic devices are commonly used to measure 3-D scapular kinematics during arm elevation in different conditions and for intervention studies. However, there is a lack of studies that evaluate within- and between-day reliability of these measurements. METHODS: The subjects were allocated to either a control group or an impingement group. Kinematic data were collected using the Flock of Birds electromagnetic device during elevation and lowering of the arm in the sagittal plane on 2 different occasions, separated by 3 to 5 days. Forty-nine subjects were tested for within-day reliability. Forty-three subjects were reassessed for between-day reliability. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients for within- and between-day assessment of scapular orientation during elevation and lowering of the arm in both groups ranged from 0.92 to 0.99 and from 0.54 to 0.88, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients for assessment of scapular orientation with the arms relaxed at the side in both groups ranged from 0.66 to 0.95. The standard error of measurement for between-day measurements ranged from 3.37° to 7.44° for both groups. The minimal detectable change for between-day measurements increased from 7.81° at the lower to 17.27° at the higher humerothoracic elevation angles. CONCLUSION: These results support the use of Flock of Birds to measure scapular orientations in subjects with and without impingement symptoms. The measurements showed excellent within-day reliability but were not highly reliable over time.

AB  - In biomechanical modeling of the shoulder, it is important to know the orientation of each bone in the shoulder girdle when estimating the loads on each musculoskeletal element. However, because of the soft tissue overlying the bones, it is difficult to accurately derive the orientation of the clavicle and scapula using surface markers during dynamic movement. The purpose of this study is to develop two regression models which predict the orientation of the clavicle and the scapula. The first regression model uses humerus orientation and individual factors such as age, gender, and anthropometry data as the predictors. The second regression model includes only the humerus orientation as the predictor. Thirty-eight participants performed 118 static postures covering the volume of the right hand reach. The orientation of the thorax, clavicle, scapula and humerus were measured with a motion tracking system. Regression analysis was performed on the Euler angles decomposed from the orientation of each bone from 26 randomly selected participants. The regression models were then validated with the remaining 12 participants. The results indicate that for the first model, the r(2) of the predicted orientation of the clavicle and the scapula ranged between 0.31 and 0.65, and the RMSE obtained from the validation dataset ranged from 6.92° to 10.39°. For the second model, the r(2) ranged between 0.19 and 0.57, and the RMSE obtained from the validation dataset ranged from 6.62° and 11.13°. The derived regression-based shoulder rhythm could be useful in future biomechanical modeling of the shoulder.

AB  - Patient-specific biomechanical models including patient-specific finite-element (FE) models are considered potentially important tools for providing personalized healthcare to patients with musculoskeletal diseases. A multi-step procedure is often needed to generate a patient-specific FE model. As all involved steps are associated with certain levels of uncertainty, it is important to study how the uncertainties of individual components propagate to final simulation results. In this study, we considered a specific case of this problem where the uncertainties of the involved steps were known and the aim was to determine the uncertainty of the predicted strain distribution. The effects of uncertainties of three important components of patient-specific models, including bone density, musculoskeletal loads and the parameters of the material mapping relationship on the predicted strain distributions, were studied. It was found that the number of uncertain components and the level of their uncertainty determine the uncertainty of simulation results. The 'average' uncertainty values were found to be relatively small even for high levels of uncertainty in the components of the model. The 'maximum' uncertainty values were, however, quite high and occurred in the areas of the scapula that are of the greatest clinical relevance. In addition, the uncertainty of the simulation result was found to be dependent on the type of movement analysed, with abduction movements presenting consistently lower uncertainty values than flexion movements.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the current practice of physiotherapists and occupational therapists in prescribing upper limb exercises to people after stroke and to explore differences between professions and work settings. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey design. PARTICIPANTS: Occupational therapists and physiotherapists working in UK stroke rehabilitation. RESULTS: The survey's response rate was 21.0% (n = 322); with 295 valid responses. Almost two thirds of therapists (64.7%, n = 191) agreed that they always prescribe upper limb exercises to a person with stroke if they can actively elevate their scapula and have grade 1 finger/wrist extension. Most therapists (98.6%, n = 278) prescribed exercises to be completed outside of therapy time, with exercises verbally communicated to family. Standardised upper limb specific outcome measures were used to evaluate the prescribed exercises by 21.9% (n = 62) OF THERAPISTS. DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN PROFESSIONS AND ACROSS WORK SETTINGS. CONCLUSION: The majority of prescribed upper limb exercises were of low intensity (range of motion or stretching exercises) rather than repetitive practice or strengthening exercises. The use of standardised outcome measures was low. Progression of exercises and the provision of written instructions on discharge occur less frequently in inpatient settings than outpatient and community settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional (3D) wing computed tomography (CT) showed a high inter-rater reliability in assessing scapular dyskinesis. METHODS: The 330 scapular movements of 165 patients were classified into 4 types by 7 blinded observers. Then, 3D wing CT was performed with patients prone, and 4 blinded observers measured 5 angles, consisting of upward rotation (UR) superior translation (ST), anterior tilting (AT), protraction (PRO), and internal rotation (IR). The inter-rater reliability (IRR) of 2 methods was calculated, and cutoff values were determined for the 5 angles on the 3D wing CT images. RESULTS: The IRR was 0.783 for the observational method of scapular dyskinesis and 0.981 for 3D wing CT in the prone position. UR and ST angles were significantly larger in type 3 more than in the other types (P < .001, P < .001), and the AT angle showed a similar pattern in type 1 (P < .001). The PRO angle was significantly larger in types 1, 2, and 3 more than in type 4 (P < .001, P < .001, P = .013), and the IR angle was significantly larger in type 2 more than in the other types (P < .001). The cutoff values of the 5 angles were UR, 117°; ST, 90°; AT, 8°; PRO, 99°; and IR, 51°. The UR angle showed a significant correlation with glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (odds ratio, 0.436; P = .029) and the IR angle with MDI (odds ratio, 8.947; P = .048). CONCLUSION: The patients with a high UR angle showed a low rate of glenohumeral internal rotation deficit and those with a high IR angle had a high rate of the MDI in affected shoulder by the determinant of the cutoff value of the 5 angles. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, development of diagnostic criteria with nonconsecutive patients, diagnostic study.

AB  - Multi-center clinical trials incorporating shoulder kinematics are currently uncommon. The absence of repeatability and limits of agreement (LoA) studies between different centers employing different motion analysis protocols has led to a lack dataset compatibility. Therefore, the aim of this work was to determine the repeatability and LoA between two shoulder kinematic protocols. The first one uses a scapula tracker (ST), the International Society of Biomechanics anatomical frames and an optoelectronic measurement system, and the second uses a spine tracker, the INAIL Shoulder and Elbow Outpatient protocol (ISEO) and an inertial and magnetic measurement system. First within-protocol repeatability for each approach was assessed on a group of 23 healthy subjects and compared with the literature. Then, the between-protocol agreement was evaluated. The within-protocol repeatability was similar for the ST ([Formula: see text] = 2.35°, [Formula: see text] = 0.97°, SEM = 2.5°) and ISEO ([Formula: see text] = 2.24°, [Formula: see text] = 0.97°, SEM = 2.3°) protocols and comparable with data from published literature. The between-protocol agreement analysis showed comparable scapula medio-lateral rotation measurements for up to 120° of flexion-extension and up to 100° of scapula plane ab-adduction. Scapula protraction-retraction measurements were in agreement for a smaller range of humeral elevation. The results of this study suggest comparable repeatability for the ST and ISEO protocols and between-protocol agreement for two scapula rotations. Different thresholds for repeatability and LoA may be adapted to suit different clinical hypotheses.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: It is well established that musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are a significant occupational health issue for dentists and hygienists. Despite this, there has been little advancement in the application of ergonomic principles in the dental profession. While the use of loupes is often promoted as an ergonomic solution, there is little published research to robustly support this claim. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the use of loupes on upper extremity MSD among dental hygienists. METHODS: The study was conducted using an exploratory pretest and post-test design, comparing musculoskeletal measures in practising dental hygienists wearing loupes with final-year dental hygiene students who did not wear loupes. Pre- and post-test measures included valid self-reported and objective outcome measures and were measured at baseline and 6 months following the intervention. Statistical analysis was conducted as a series of mixed anovas with time and treatment as the independent variables. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a significant interaction between time and treatment for the Disabilities of the Shoulder, Arm and Hand (DASH) scores (P < 0.04), indicating an improvement in symptoms for the treatment group but a reversed trend for the controls. There was also a significant mean increase in scapular position measures; however, this finding was evident in both groups, indicating that these were not a result of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study suggests that wearing loupes appears to have both positive and negative effects on upper extremity MSD among dental hygienists. Ongoing research is required to determine the long-term effects of loupes wear, over an extended period of time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brachial plexus birth palsy occurs in 0.4 to 4.6 of every 1000 live births, with residual shoulder dysfunction in approximately one third of cases. Clinical measures, such as the Mallet classification, provide no insight into the scapulothoracic and glenohumeral contributions to tested global shoulder movements. This study describes the scapulothoracic and glenohumeral components of shoulder motion during the modified Mallet test. METHODS: Twelve children with Erb's palsy (C5-6) and 8 children with extended Erb's palsy (C5-7) were recruited. The unaffected limbs of 6 subjects were also tested. Locations of markers placed on the thorax, humerus, and scapula were recorded in a neutral position and each of the modified Mallet positions. Scapulothoracic, glenohumeral, and humerothoracic helical displacements and acromion process linear displacements were compared between groups. RESULTS: The brachial plexus birth palsy groups exhibited significantly smaller glenohumeral displacements in all modified Mallet positions and significantly larger scapulothoracic displacements in the global external rotation and hand to mouth positions. Discriminant function analysis using only humerothoracic variables correctly classified 76.9% of subjects. Discriminant function analysis incorporating scapulothoracic, glenohumeral, and acromion process displacement variables produced accuracy of 92.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Children with brachial plexus birth palsy demonstrated decreased glenohumeral contributions to achieve every modified Mallet position and increased scapulothoracic contribution in two positions compared with the unaffected group. Different scapulothoracic and glenohumeral strategies were identified between groups. Finally, scapulothoracic and glenohumeral components of shoulder motion are more specific than humerothoracic measures to diagnostic classification.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted on a total of 300 individuals (mean age: 44.83, range: 18-83; proportion male/female: 1.59), calculating the SBA through manual measurement with a goniometer. An intraobserver Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of 0.87 and a interobserver ICC of 0.84 was observed. RESULTS: The values for the SBA in healthy population were 2.505 ± 2.340°. We define the abnormality criteria for this sample with an angle greater than 7.185°. DISCUSSION: SBA manual measurement is a simple and reproducible assessment of the position and rotation of the scapula in clinical practice. The main findings of this study are the reference values for the SBA and a statistical cut-off to define abnormality.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to validate a reverse shoulder computer impingement model and quantify the impact of implant position on scapular impingement by comparing it to that of a radiographic analysis of 256 patients who received the same prosthesis and were followed postoperatively for an average of 22.2 months. METHODS: A geometric computer analysis quantified anterior and posterior scapular impingement as the humerus was internally and externally rotated at varying levels of abduction and adduction relative to a fixed scapula at defined glenoid implant positions. These impingement results were compared to radiographic study of 256 patients who were analyzed for notching, glenoid baseplate position, and glenosphere overhang. RESULTS: The computer model predicted no impingement at 0° humeral abduction in the scapular plane for the 38 mm, 42 mm, and 46 mm devices when the glenoid baseplate cage peg is positioned 18.6 mm, 20.4 mm, and 22.7 mm from the inferior glenoid rim (of the reamed glenoid) or when glenosphere overhang of 4.6 mm, 4.7 mm, and 4.5 mm was obtained with each size glenosphere, respectively. When compared to the radiographic analysis, the computer model correctly predicted impingement based upon glenoid base- plate position in 18 of 26 patients with scapular notching and based upon glenosphere overhang in 15 of 26 patients with scapular notching. CONCLUSIONS: Reverse shoulder implant positioning plays an important role in scapular notching. The results of this study demonstrate that the computer impingement model can effectively predict impingement based upon implant positioning in a majority of patients who developed scapular notching clinically. This computer analysis provides guidance to surgeons on implant positions that reduce scapular notching, a well-documented complication of reverse shoulder arthroplasty.

AB  - Knowledge of three-dimensional scapular movements is essential to understand post-stroke shoulder pain. The goal of the present work is to determine the feasibility and the within and between session reliability of a movement protocol for three-dimensional scapular movement analysis in stroke patients with mild to moderate impairment, using an optoelectronic measurement system. Scapular kinematics of 10 stroke patients and 10 healthy controls was recorded on two occasions during active anteflexion and abduction from 0° to 60° and from 0° to 120°. All tasks were executed unilaterally and bilaterally. The protocol's feasibility was first assessed, followed by within and between session reliability of scapular total range of motion (ROM), joint angles at start position and of angular waveforms. Additionally, measurement errors were calculated for all parameters. Results indicated that the protocol was generally feasible for this group of patients and assessors. Within session reliability was very good for all tasks. Between sessions, scapular angles at start position were measured reliably for most tasks, while scapular ROM was more reliable during the 120° tasks. In general, scapular angles showed higher reliability during anteflexion compared to abduction, especially for protraction. Scapular lateral rotations resulted in smallest measurement errors. This study indicates that scapular kinematics can be measured reliably and with precision within one measurement session. In case of multiple test sessions, further methodological optimization is required for this protocol to be suitable for clinical decision-making and evaluation of treatment efficacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Decreased scapulothoracic motion has been associated with various pathologies of the shoulder. Reliable and simple assessment methods of scapular mobility are, however lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the interrater reliability of four clinical tests to assess scapulothoracic motion in patients with a slightly restricted shoulder flexion. METHODS: A total of nineteen patients with a symptomatic slight restriction of shoulder flexion and twenty asymptomatic subjects were evaluated. The investigation consisted of four palpatory tests to assess scapulothoracic motion. A two-level rating scale (positive, negative) was utilised. Interrater reliability was evaluated using kappa coefficients. RESULTS: We found substantial to almost perfect (Kappa = 0.63-0.4) interrater reliability for the four tests. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the four mobility tests of the shoulder are a reliable and simple instrument to assess patients with a slightly restricted shoulder flexion. Future studies should be conducted to evaluate the validity of these tests and to establish their clinical usefulness.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to establish the reliability for measuring scapular muscle thickness, and to examine how scapular muscle thickness changes with respect to external loads. Participants were asymptomatic subjects recruited from a sample of convenience. Thickness Measures were taken using rehabilitative ultrasound imaging (RUSI) under 11 conditions, rest and 10 progressive loads, for the Lower Trapezius (LT) and Serratus Anterior (SA). The procedures were repeated 1 week later to determine reliability. Bland and Altman limits of agreement and Interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to determine reliability. Separate repeated measure ANOVAs were performed to determine differences in muscle thickness for both muscles across 3 conditions; rest and the 2 loaded conditions that represented the lowest and highest torque values. Results demonstrate good within and between day reliability for the LT (ICC = .86 to .99) and SA (ICC = .88 to .99). For the LT and SA, there were significant differences between the resting thickness and 2 lifting conditions (p &#8804; .01) but not between the two lifting conditions. It was concluded that RUSI is reliable in measuring scapular muscle thickness. RUSI is sensitive enough to detect absolute changes in thickness from resting to a contracted state but unable to detect differences between loads imposed on the shoulder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The success of Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA) is believed to depend on the restoration of the natural anatomy of the joint and a key development has been the introduction of modular humeral components to more accurately restore the patient's anatomy. However, there are no peer-reviewed studies that have reported the degree of glenoid component mal-position achieved in clinical practice and the clinical outcome of such mal-position. The main purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of glenoid implant positioning during TSA and to relate it to the radiological (occurrence of radiolucent lines and osteolysis on CT) and clinical outcomes. METHODS: 68 TSAs were assessed with a mean follow-up of 38+/-27 months. The clinical evaluation consisted of measuring the mobility as well as of the Constant Score. The radiological evaluation was performed on CT-scans in which metal artefacts had been eliminated. From the CT-scans radiolucent lines and osteolysis were assessed. The positions of the glenoid and humeral components were also measured from the CT scans. RESULTS: Four position glenoid component parameters were calculated The posterior version (6°±12°; mean ± SD), the superior tilt (12°±17°), the rotation of the implant relative to the scapular plane (3°±14°) and the off-set distance of the centre of the glenoid implant from the scapular plane (6±4 mm). An inferiorly inclined implant was found to be associated with higher levels of radiolucent lines while retroversion and non-neutral rotation were associated with a reduced range of motion. CONCLUSION: this study demonstrates that glenoid implants of anatomic TSA are poorly positioned and that this malposition has a direct effect on the clinical and radiological outcome. Thus, further developments in glenoid implantation techniques are required to enable the surgeon to achieve a desired implant position and outcome.

AB  - The glenopolar angle assesses the rotational alignment of the glenoid and may provide prognostic information and aid the management of scapula fractures. We have analysed the effect of the anteroposterior (AP) shoulder radiograph rotational offset on the glenopolar angle in a laboratory setting and used this to assess the accuracy of shoulder imaging employed in routine clinical practice. Fluoroscopic imaging was performed on 25 non-paired scapulae tagged with 2 mm steel spheres to determine the orientation of true AP views. The glenopolar angle was measured on all the bony specimens rotated at 10° increments. The mean glenopolar angle measured on the bone specimens in rotations between 0° and 20° and thereafter was found to be significantly different (p < 0.001). We also obtained the AP radiographs of the uninjured shoulder of 30 patients treated for fractures at our centre and found that none fitted the criteria of a true AP shoulder radiograph. The mean angular offset from the true AP view was 38° (10° to 65°) for this cohort. Radiological AP shoulder views may not fully project the normal anatomy of the scapular body and the measured glenopolar angle. The absence of a true AP view may compromise the clinical management of a scapular fracture.

AB  - Objective: Evaluate the static positioning of the scapula on the rib cage in healthy subjects by means of clinical and radiographic evaluation to assess interexaminer reliability of clinical examination and verify the reliability of this evaluation method compared to the radiographic examination. Methods: we selected 30 adult individuals of both sexes with no diagnosis of shoulder pathology. The static clinical examination, following the protocol suggested by Burkhart et al, was performed repeatedly by two independent examiners, followed by the radiographic examination, which was later examined by the first evaluator. Results: 73.3% of the subjects showed positioning of the scapula considered normal. The interexaminer reliability and that of the clinical examination in relation to radiography were considered low and very low, respectively. Conclusion: The reproducibility of the evaluation performed by Burkhart was considered satisfactory to good, while the interexaminer reproducibility of the clinical examination and the static reproducibility of the clinical examination with radiography were considered poor to satisfactory.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The shoulder has the greatest range of motion of any joint in the human body. This is due, in part, to the complex interplay between the glenohumeral (GH) joint and the scapulothoracic (ST) articulation. Currently, our ability to study shoulder kinematics is limited, because existing models isolate the GH joint and rely on manual manipulation to create motion, and have low reproducibility. Similarly, most established techniques track shoulder motion discontinuously with limited accuracy. METHODS: To overcome these problems, we have designed a novel system in which the shoulder girdle is studied intact, incorporating both GH and ST motions. In this system, highly reproducible trajectories are created using a robotic actuator to control the intact shoulder girdle. High-speed cameras are employed to track retroreflective bone markers continuously. RESULTS: We evaluated this automated system's capacity to reproducibly capture GH translation in intact and pathologic shoulder conditions. A pair of shoulders (left and right) were tested during forward elevation at baseline, with a winged scapula, and after creation of a full thickness supraspinatus tear. DISCUSSION: The system detected differences in GH translations as small as 0.5 mm between different conditions. For each, three consecutive trials were performed and demonstrated high reproducibility and high precision.

AB  - Musculoskeletal shoulder models allow non-invasive prediction of parameters that cannot be measured, particularly the loading applied to morphological structures and neurological control. This insight improves treatment and avoidance of pathology and performance evaluation and optimisation. A lack of appropriate validation and knowledge of model parameters' accuracy may cause reduced clinical success for these models. Instrumented implants have recently been used to validate musculoskeletal models, adding important information to the literature. This development along with increasing prevalence of shoulder models necessitates a fresh review of available models and their utility. The practical uses of models are described. Accuracy of model inputs, modelling techniques and model sensitivity is the main technical review undertaken. Collection and comparison of these parameters are vital to understanding disagreement between model outputs. Trends in shoulder modelling are highlighted: validation through instrumented prostheses, increasing openness and strictly constrained, optimised, measured kinematics. Future directions are recommended: validation through focus on model sub-sections, increased subject specificity with imaging techniques determining muscle and body segment parameters and through different scaling and kinematics optimisation approaches.

AB  - Pain and tenderness of the upper trapezius are the major complaints among people with chronic neck and shoulder disorders. Hyper-activation and increased muscle tension of the upper trapezius during arm elevation will cause imbalance of the scapular muscle force and contribute to neck and shoulder disorders. Assessing the elasticity of the upper trapezius in different arm positions is therefore important for identifying people at risk so as to give preventive programmes or for monitoring the effectiveness of the intervention programmes for these disorders. This study aimed to establish the reliability of supersonic shear imaging (SSI) in quantifying upper trapezius elasticity/shear elastic modulus and its ability to measure the modulation of muscle elasticity during arm elevation. Twenty-eight healthy adults (15 males, 13 females; mean ageâ=â29.6 years) were recruited to participate in the study. In each participant, the shear elastic modulus of the upper trapezius while the arm was at rest and at 30° abduction was measured by two operators and twice by operator 1 with a time interval between the measurements. The results showed excellent within- and between-session intra-operator (ICCâ=â0.87-0.97) and inter-observer (ICCâ=â0.78-0.83) reliability for the upper trapezius elasticity with the arm at rest and at 30° abduction. An increase of 55.23% of shear elastic modulus from resting to 30° abduction was observed. Our findings demonstrate the possibilities for using SSI to quantify muscle elasticity and its potential role in delineating the modulation of upper trapezius elasticity, which is essential for future studies to compare the differences in shear elastic modulus between normal elasticity and that of individuals with neck and shoulder disorders.

AB  - The work describes and compares the conformation traits and gait characteristics in the main native Iberian dressage Purebreds (Lusitano, Spanish and Menorca horses). In total, 4 strides belonging to each of 66 males (4-14 years old) were recorded at handled trot, using a 3D semi-automatic movement analysis system. Principal component analysis (PCA) and intraclass Correlations (iC) were computed. The Menorca Purebred showed proportionally higher limbs (23.8 and 15.1cm for the forelimb cannon and pastern lengths), the Lusitano Purebred had larger inclinations (66.1°, 37.7° and 47.9° for the scapula and pastern angles), and the Spanish Purebred presented a longer scapula (41.5 cm) and a larger hip angle (132.1°), apparently showing a better conformation for dressage gaits. However, the three breeds presented undesirable tarsus joint conformation (<155.5°) for dressage performance. In general, all of them showed good features in the kinematics of the forelimbs. Nevertheless, the functional capacity of their hindlimbs and linear parameters probably need to be improved for their competitiveness.

AB  - Electromagnetic devices allow the non invasive and accurate measurement of 3D scapula kinematics. The acromial method allows continuous dynamic measurement using a skin surface sensor fixed to the acromion. Inter-session intra and inter-observer repeatability of 3D scapular kinematics have only been partially assessed for analytical movements and never for functional tasks. Inter-session intra and inter-observer repeatability of 3D scapular kinematics were assessed for arm elevation in the sagittal and frontal planes and for two activities of daily living (ADL), hair combing and back washing, in both shoulders of 15 healthy subjects, using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the standard error of measurement (SEM), the small real difference (SRD) and the Bland and Altman's graphical method. Intra-observer repeatability was good to excellent for every scapular rotation for both arm elevation in isolated planes and ADL (ICC ranged from 0.64 to 0.95). Inter-observer repeatability of scapular rotations was fair to excellent for arm elevation in isolated planes (ICC ranged from 0.49 to 0.92) and poor to excellent for ADL (ICC ranged from 0.35 to 0.89). Inter-observer repeatability of scapular protraction/retraction had the lowest ICC. For both inter-session intra and inter-observer reliability, the SEM and SRD remained low and Bland and Altman's graphical method showed a good repeatability of the measurement method. Longitudinal monitoring of a subject's scapular kinematics by a trained observer is reliable. The inter-observer repeatability of scapular protraction/retraction must be improved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite numerous methodological flaws in previous study designs and the lack of validation in primary care populations, clinical tests for identifying acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) pain are widely utilised without concern for such issues. The aim of this study was to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of traditional ACJ tests and to compare their accuracy with other clinical examination features for identifying a predominant ACJ pain source in a primary care cohort. METHODS: Consecutive patients with shoulder pain were recruited prospectively from primary health care clinics. Following a standardised clinical examination and diagnostic injection into the subacromial bursa, all participants received a fluoroscopically guided diagnostic block of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride (XylocaineTM) into the ACJ. Diagnostic accuracy statistics including sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) were calculated for traditional ACJ tests (Active Compression/O'Brien's test, cross-body adduction, localised ACJ tenderness and Hawkins-Kennedy test), and for individual and combinations of clinical examination variables that were associated with a positive anaesthetic response (PAR) (P&#8804;0.05) defined as 80% or more reduction in post-injection pain intensity during provocative clinical tests. RESULTS: Twenty two of 153 participants (14%) reported an 80% PAR. None of the traditional ACJ tests were associated with an 80% PAR (P<0.05) and combinations of traditional tests were not able to discriminate between a PAR and a negative anaesthetic response (AUC 0.507; 95% CI: 0.366, 0.647; P>0.05). Five clinical examination variables (repetitive mechanism of pain onset, no referred pain below the elbow, thickened or swollen ACJ, no symptom provocation during passive glenohumeral abduction and external rotation) were associated with an 80% PAR (P<0.05) and demonstrated an ability to accurately discriminate between an PAR and NAR (AUC 0.791; 95% CI 0.702, 0.880; P<0.001). Less than two positive clinical features resulted in 96% sensitivity (95% CI 0.78, 0.99) and a LR- 0.09 (95% CI 0.02, 0.41) and four positive clinical features resulted in 95% specificity (95% CI 0.90, 0.98) and a LR+ of 4.98 (95% CI 1.69, 13.84). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of primary care patients with predominantly subacute or chronic ACJ pain of non-traumatic onset, traditional ACJ tests were of limited diagnostic value. Combinations of other history and physical examination findings were able to more accurately identify injection-confirmed ACJ pain in this cohort.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Following an increase in the incidence of scapular fractures and interest in the outcome of their treatment, a basic classification system was developed for ease of use in the emergency setting. It has been expanded to a comprehensive system to allow for more in-depth classification of scapular fractures for clinical research and surgical decision making. It focusses on three specific regions of the scapula: the scapular body, the glenoid fossa and the lateral scapular suspension system (LSSS). This article presents a classification of the LSSS involvement to better characterise the injuries of this region and to emphasise its relevance to evaluation of the position of the scapula, hence the glenoid fossa, and so the centre of rotation of the shoulder joint. METHODS: An iterative consensus and evaluation process comprising an international group of seven experienced shoulder specialist and orthopaedic trauma surgeons was used to specify and evaluate the failure of the LSSS associated with scapula fractures. This was supported by a series of agreement studies. The system considered lack of involvement (S0), incomplete (S1) and complete (S2) failure of the LSSS. The last evaluation was conducted on a consecutive collection of 120 scapula fractures documented by three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) reconstruction videos. RESULTS: Surgeons agreed on the involvement/failure of the LSSS in 47% of the 120 cases with an overall Kappa of 0.54. The sample most likely included 70 S0, 29 S1 and 21 S2 cases, where surgeons showed median classification accuracies of 93%, 71% and 80% for these categories, respectively. While two surgeons showed some uncertainty about their classification, the remaining surgeons only failed to identify LSSS failure in <20% of the cases. Kappa coefficients of reliability for classification of incomplete and complete LSSS involvement according to subcategories were 0.85 and 0.82, respectively. CONCLUSION: While LSSS involvement can be reliably identified, its characterisation regarding complexity is problematic even with 3D CT images. The proposed LSSS system is considered clinically relevant and sufficient to further assess its role in treatment-decision processes and outcome prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no evidence-based treatment algorithm established for acromioclavicular joint (AC joint) dislocation classified as type Rockwood III injury. Recent meta-analyses revealed no advantage of surgical treatment compared to the non-operative approach. Both surgical and non-surgical approaches have been reported with inconsistent results. Therefore, the hypothesis of the current study was that patients classified as having Rockwood grade III injury may have different degrees of horizontal AC joint instability. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 18 consecutive patients who had sustained a dislocation of the AC joint classified as Rockwood III were evaluated radiologically to quantify the horizontal instability of the AC joint. The specific radiological investigation included lateral stress x-rays (Alexander view) und axial stress x-rays with the affected arm in a horizontal adduction position. RESULTS: The dynamic horizontal instability of the AC joint was found to be independent of the vertical dislocation measured in the Rockwood classification. CONCLUSION: For further treatment studies Rockwood III injuries should be distinguished in patients presenting with or without a substantial horizontal AC joint instability.

AB  - Rodents of the subfamily Sigmodontinae comprise a highly diversified group in the Atlantic Forest, with semifossorial, terrestrial, semiaquatic, scansorial, and arboreal forms. In this study, we analyzed morphometric variation in humerus, scapula, ulna, radius, femur, tibia, and pelvis to investigate its possible relationship with the different types of locomotion recorded in the literature. Skeletal characters were measured in 321 specimens belonging to 29 species and 19 genera either restricted to or recorded in this ecoregion. Multivariate morphometric analyses (principal component and canonical variate analyses) arranged individuals of different genera in groups congruent with the different types of locomotion. This arrangement was more clearly defined when analyses included only forelimb measurements, indicating that most of the variation in appendicular traits associated with the different locomotor modes occurs in the forelimb skeleton. Semifossorial forms exhibited the most distinct appendicular morphology, as well as the greatest frequency of endemism among analyzed species. These results suggest that this mode of locomotion led to greater differentiation in semifossorial Atlantic forest sigmodontines than in terrestrial and arboreal forms, which were found to have more subtle differentiation and fewer endemics. Scansorial species could not be set apart from terrestrial ones in terms of appendicular morphology, suggesting that these two modes of locomotion are the most similar and generalized for the group, as they occur in most lineages in the subfamily. The results of this study corroborate previous observations on the relevance of appendicular characters in the differentiation of species and genera in the subfamily Sigmodontinae.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the identified risk factors for anterior shoulder instability is bone loss on the anterior-inferior glenoid rim. The aim of our study was to assess intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of the Bernageau view to estimate glenoid bone loss and validate this radiographic method with computed tomography (CT) scan. The second objective was to find correlation between Bernageau and arthroscopic bone loss measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients were included retrospectively. Two independent observers evaluated glenoid bone loss with the ratio between glenoid joint surface diameters of the pathologic and healthy shoulders on Bernageau views. Results were compared with CT (gold standard) and arthroscopic measurements. Validity and reliability of Bernageau measurement were assessed with Spearman correlation coefficients (r) and intraclass correlation coefficients (&#961;). RESULTS: The interobserver and intraobserver reliability and the validity of Bernageau measurement compared with the reference test, the CT scan, were all excellent, with a Spearman &#961; between 0.56 (P = .0002) and 0.95 (P < .00001) and an intraclass correlation coefficient between 0.82 (P = .0007) and 0.97 (P < .10(-5)). There was no correlation with arthroscopic evaluation. CONCLUSION: The glenoid bone defect measurement on the Bernageau profile view is a valid and reliable method. Furthermore, it is easy to use in current clinical practice. Surgeons can therefore consider it as a tool for preoperative planning, and its use could decrease CT scan indications.

AB  - The concept of motor equivalent combinations of arm muscles, or M-modes, was investigated during reaching to insert a pointer into a cylindrical target with and without an elbow perturbation. Five M-modes across 15 arm/scapula muscles were identified by principal component analysis with factor extraction. The relationship between small changes in the M-modes and changes in the position/orientation of the pointer were investigated by linear regression analyses. The results revealed a motor equivalent organization of the M-modes for perturbed compared with non-perturbed reaches, both with respect to hand position and orientation, especially in the first 100-ms postperturbation. Similar findings were obtained for motor equivalence computed based on changes in the joint configuration, although the kinematically defined motor equivalence was stronger for pointer orientation. The results support the hypothesis that the nervous system organizes muscles into M-modes and flexibly scales M-mode activation to preserve stable values of variables directly related to performance success.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aberrations in scapular motion are believed to be associated with the presence of shoulder or elbow pathologies. There are many methods to evaluate scapular kinematics, but they have certain limitations. Nevertheless, it is believed that appropriate rehabilitation for each type of scapular dyskinesis is important. METHODS: Eighty-nine athletes were videotaped and seven blinded observers categorized scapular dyskinesis into 4 types, which was followed by 3-dimensional (3D) wing computer tomography (CT). Four blinded examiners evaluated 5 angles [upward rotation (UR), internal rotation (IR), anterior tilting (AT), superior translation (ST), and protraction (PRO)] on the 3D wing CT. Inter-rater reliability (IRR) was calculated for both the methods. CT scan measurements were compared with the 4 observational types to establish the validity. RESULTS: The IRR with observational assessment of scapular dyskinesis into 4 types was good, 0.780. The 3D wing CT analysis had a very high IRR, 0.972. There was a statistically significant correlation between observational assessment and 3D wing CT analysis. The UR angle, ST angle in type 3 scapular dyskinesis, and AT angle in type 1 scapular dyskinesis were increased as compared with those in the other types of scapular dyskinesis. All these measurements were made in the resting position of the scapula. CONCLUSION: The 3D wing CT analysis allows precise quantification of a position associated with scapular dyskinesis. Therefore, 3D wing CT can be considered as an alternative method for assessing scapular dyskinesis.

AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To present the TightRope (Arthrex, Naples, FL) technique and its results in the arthroscopic stabilisation of acute acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) dislocation carried out at our department. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From July 2009 till December 2010, arthroscopic stabilisation of acute ACJ dislocation was performed in 22 patients. The group consisted of 18 men and four women with an average age of 37.4 years. The Rockwood type III to type V ACJ dislocations (III, 16; IV, 1; V, 5) were indicated for surgery. The average interval between injury and surgery was 5.4 days. In all cases, a second-generation TightRope implant was inserted by the EndoButton technique joining the distal end of the clavicle and the coracoid process. The results were evaluated using the UCLA Shoulder Scale at 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: All 22 patients returned to their pre-operative activities without any restriction of shoulder motion within 5 months of surgery. The average post-operative UCLA score was 31.2 points (range, 28 to 35). Radiographic evidence of the loss of full reduction, with no effect on the clinical outcome, was recorded in four patients (18%) during post-operative rehabilitation. Of these, one had Rockwood type III, two had type IV and one had type V dislocations. One patient suffered post-operative pull-out of the implant from the coracoid; three patients showed skin wound healing by second intention above the lateral clavicle, with one requiring surgical repair under local anaesthesia. There was no neurovascular complication, intra- or postoperative fracture of the coracoid process or lateral clavicle, or deep wound infection. DISCUSSION: Arthroscopic stabilisation of acute ACJ dislocation is a minimally invasive procedure providing the coracoclavicular ligament complex with dynamic stability. In comparison with open procedures, it is less painful post-operatively, allows the patients to return early to daily activities and has a better cosmetic effect. It eliminates the necessity of removing the osteosynthetic material, as is the case in commonly used techniques such as Bosworth's method, K-wiring, osteorrhaphy or hook plate insertion. The loss of full reduction in four patients, as observed on radiographs during their rehabilitation, was not accompanied by any clinical problems and is in agreement with the findings of other authors. In our group, it occurred in Rockwood grade IV and grade V dislocations. For these, there is a possibility of using two implants in order to increase stability and prevent the loss of full reduction but this involves a higher risk of coracoid fracture, extension of operative time and higher costs. However, a loss of reduction in some patients has also been reported by the authors who have used two implants. Therefore we prefer using a single TightRope implant, particularly in acute grade III ACJ dislocations requiring surgical treatment in patients engaged in repetitive overhead activities related to sports or occupation. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic stabilisation of acute ACJ dislocations using a single TightRope implant is an elegant minimally invasive method with good results in indicated cases. It proves efficient particularly in Rockwood type III injuries in patients who have to do repetitive overhead activities. Acute type IV and type V ACJ dislocations treated by this technique show a loss of full reduction on radiographs more frequently, although no effect on the clinical outcome is evident.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and critique the evidence regarding the diagnostic accuracy of physical examination tests for the scapula in patients with shoulder disorders. METHODS: A systematic, computerised literature search of PubMED, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library databases (from database inception through January 2012) using keywords related to diagnostic accuracy of physical examination tests of the scapula. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool was used to critique the quality of each paper. RESULTS: Eight articles met the inclusion criteria; three were considered to be of high quality. Of the three high-quality studies, two were in reference to a 'diagnosis' of shoulder pain. Only one high-quality article referenced specific shoulder pathology of acromioclavicular dislocation with reported sensitivity of 71% and 41% for the scapular dyskinesis and SICK scapula test, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, no physical examination test of the scapula was found to be useful in differentially diagnosing pathologies of the shoulder.

AB  - This report describes a novel kinematic analysis technique that was used to assess a floating shoulder malunion before and after corrective osteotomy. The patient underwent this analysis pre- and postoperatively using electromagnetic motion sensors and monitoring software. Pre- and postoperative motion curves were compared with normal subject data to determine if shoulder girdle movement was more or less similar to subjects without any shoulder pathology. Additionally, strength, range of motion, and patient-based questionnaires, including DASH and SF-36, were obtained. The preoperative DASH score was 30 and decreased to 3 in 18 months after surgery. Kinematic analysis demonstrated improved postoperative resting position of the scapula and motion patterns more consistent with healthy subject data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Latarjet coracoid process transfer procedure is an established, reliable treatment for glenoid deficiency associated with recurrent anterior shoulder instability, but changes in neurovascular anatomy resulting from the procedure are a concern. The purpose of our cadaveric study was to identify changes in the neurovascular anatomy after a Latarjet procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained 4 paired, fresh-frozen cadaveric forequarters (8 shoulders) from the Maryland State Anatomy Board. In each shoulder, we preoperatively measured the distances from the midanterior glenoid rim to the musculocutaneous nerve, axillary nerve, and axillary artery in 2 directions (lateral to medial and superior to inferior) and with the arm in 2 positions (0° abduction/neutral rotation; 30° abduction/30° external rotation), for a total of 12 measurements. We then created a standardized bony defect in the anterior-inferior glenoid, reconstructed it with the Latarjet procedure, and repeated the same measurements. Two examiners independently took each measurement twice. Inter-rater reliability was adequate, allowing pre-Latarjet measurements to be combined, averaged, and compared with combined and averaged post-Latarjet measurements by using paired Student t tests (significance, P &#8804; .05). RESULTS: We found (1) significant differences in the location of the musculocutaneous nerve in the superior-to-inferior direction for both arm positions, (2) notably lax and consistently overlapping musculocutaneous and axillary nerves, and (3) an unchanged axillary artery location. CONCLUSIONS: The Latarjet procedure resulted in consistent and clinically significant alterations in the anatomic relationships of the musculocutaneous and axillary nerves, which may make them vulnerable to injury during revision surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current non-invasive 3-D scapular kinematic measurement techniques such as electromagnetic tracking are subjected to restrictions of wired sensors and limited capture space. Video-based motion analysis provides greater freedom with relatively less movement restriction. However, video-based motion analysis was rarely used in and not validated for scapular kinematics. METHODS: Scapular kinematics of five subjects performing abduction, scaption, and internal/external rotation was captured simultaneously with video-based motion analysis and dynamic stereo X-ray, a gold standard for tracking scapular movements. The data from video-based motion analysis was correlated with the data from dynamic stereo X-ray for validity evaluation. FINDINGS: Strong and significant correlations were identified in scapular protraction/retraction and medial/lateral rotation during abduction and scaption, and scapular medial/lateral rotation and anterior/posterior tilt during internal/external rotation. INTERPRETATION: Video-based motion analysis is valid for evaluating a single subject's scapular movement pattern in protraction/retraction during abduction and scaption, and medial/lateral-rotation during internal/external rotation. Anterior/posterior-tilt during abduction and scaption should be investigated with caution. Video motion analysis is also valid for evaluating group average of scapular kinematics except for protraction/retraction during internal/external rotation. While acknowledging the inherent limitations, video-based motion analysis is an appropriate technique for tracking scapular kinematics.

AB  - Alterations in scapular muscle activity, including excess activation of the upper trapezius (UT) and onset latencies of the lower trapezius (LT) and serratus anterior (SA) muscles, are associated with abnormal scapular motion and shoulder impingement. Limited information exists on the reliability of neuromuscular activity to demonstrate the efficacy of interventions. The purpose of this study was to characterize the reproducibility of scapular muscle activity (mean activity, relative onset timing) over time and establish the minimal detectable change (MDC). Surface electromyography (sEMG) of the UT, LT, SA and anterior deltoid (AD) muscles in 16 adults were captured during an overhead lifting task in two sessions, one-week apart. sEMG data were also normalized to maximum isometric contraction and the relative onset and mean muscle activity during concentric and eccentric phases of the scapular muscles were calculated. Additionally, reliability of the absolute sEMG data during the lifting task and MVIC was evaluated. Both intrasession and intersession reliability of normalized and absolute mean scapular muscle activity, assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), ranged from 0.62 to 0.99; MDC values were between 1.3% and 11.7% MVIC and 24 to 135 mV absolute sEMG. Reliability of sEMG during MVIC was ICC = 0.82-0.99, with the exception of intersession upper trapezius reliability (ICC = 0.36). Within session reliability of muscle onset times was ICC = 0.88-0.97, but between session reliability was lower with ICC = 0.43-0.73; MDC were between 39 and 237 ms. Small changes in scapular neuromuscular mean activity (>11.7% MVIC) can be interpreted as meaningful change, while change in muscle onset timing in light of specific processing parameters used in this study is more variable.

AB  - Shoulder motion has been mainly analysed in children based on thoraco-humeral (TH) joint kinematics, excluding the scapula-thoracic (ST) and gleno-humeral (GH) joints. In order to measure 3D scapulo-humeral motion using an optoelectronic system, we propose a protocol based on an acromion marker cluster (AMC), a functional method to determine the gleno-humeral rotation centre and different Euler sequences. This study investigated the validity of the AMC compared to the palpation of anatomical landmarks with a scapula locator, assessed the intra-session repeatability and the ability to discriminate differences of such a protocol in 10 typically developing children (TD) and 10 children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP) during 6 different tasks (flexion, abduction, horizontal abduction, hand to head, hand to controlateral shoulder and hand to back pocket). For both populations, the AMC method showed an overall Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5.5°. The AMC method under-estimated the protraction/retraction of the scapula during abduction. The within-session reliability was good to excellent for all tasks except the hand to back pocket task. The YXY recommended Euler sequence for TH and GH joints resulted in gimbal lock for most of the tasks whereas the XZY sequence could be used for most of the tasks and most of the children.

AB  - The immediate goal of this study was to develop and validate a noninvasive, computational surface mapping approach for measuring scapular kinematics by using available motion capture technology in an innovative manner. The long-term goal is to facilitate clinical determination of the role of the scapula in children with brachial plexus birth palsy (BPBP). The population for this study consisted of fourteen healthy adults with prominent scapulae. Subject-specific scapular templates were created using the coordinates of five scapular landmarks obtained from palpation with subjects seated and arms relaxed in a neutral position. The scapular landmarks were re-palpated and their locations recorded in the six arm positions of the modified Mallet classification. The six Mallet positions were repeated with approximately 300 markers covering the scapula. The markers formed a surface map covering the tissue over the scapula. The scapular template created in the neutral position was iteratively fit to the surface map of each trial, providing an estimate of the orientation of the scapula. These estimates of scapular orientation were compared to the known scapular orientation determined from the scapular landmarks palpated in each Mallet position. The magnitude of the largest mean difference about an anatomical axis between the two measures of scapular orientation was 3.8° with an RMS error of 5.9°. This technique is practical for populations with visibly prominent scapulae (e.g., BPBP patients), for which it is a viable alternative to existing clinical methods with comparable accuracy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Though several glenoid implants were developed over the past years, a high rate of glenoid loosening remains. This complication is linked to the glenohumeral stability, defined as humeral head translation. In an intact shoulder, this concept is ensured by all active and passive elements, particularly the labrum. Two features of a glenoid implant can be adjusted to improve the stability, or, in other words, to decrease the translations: the first is the mismatch, defined as the difference of curvature between the prosthetic head and glenoid; the second is the shape of the glenoid component. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the performance of 2 glenoid components (Ceraver, Roissy, France): (1) a standard design and (2) a design named "labrum design" with a superior part simulating the anatomic labrum. METHODS: An experimental device was developed to evaluate forces and kinematics. The device simulated active, dynamic and continuous abduction of an entire arm. It reproduced the Scapulo-Humeral Rhythm. The labrum design was installed first. To evaluate the effect of mismatch on the glenohumeral stability, 3 humeral heads were tested, corresponding to the ones recommended by the company. The experiment was repeated for the standard design. FINDINGS: The results obtained show a general decrease of the prosthetic head translation with the labrum design compared to the standard design. No noticeable effect of mismatch was found. INTERPRETATION: A proof of concept of the interest of the artificial labrum was provided since it improved the glenohumeral stability.

AB  - Conclusions about normal and pathologic shoulder motion are frequently made from studies using skin surface markers, yet accuracy of such sensors representing humeral motion is not well known. Nineteen subjects were investigated with flock of birds electromagnetic sensors attached to transcortical pins placed into the scapula and humerus, and a thermoplastic cuff secured on the arm. Subjects completed two repetitions of raising and lowering the arm in the sagittal, scapular and coronal planes, as well as shoulder internal and external rotation with the elbow at the side and abducted to 90°. Humeral motion was recorded simultaneously from surface and bone fixed sensors. The average magnitude of error was calculated for the surface and bone fixed measurements throughout the range of motion. ANOVA tested for differences across angles of elevation, raising and lowering, and differences in body mass index. For all five motions tested, the plane of elevation rotation average absolute error ranged from 0-2°, while the humeral elevation rotation average error ranged from 0-4°. The axial rotation average absolute error was much greater, ranging from 5° during elevation motions to approaching 30° at maximum excursion of internal/external rotation motions. Average absolute error was greater in subjects with body mass index greater than 25. Surface sensors are an accurate way of measuring humeral elevation rotations and plane of elevation rotations. Conversely, there is a large amount of average error for axial rotations when using a humeral cuff to measure glenohumeral internal/external rotation as the primary motion.

AB  - With the exception of displaced articular glenoid fractures, management of scapular fractures has largely consisted of benign neglect, with an emphasis on motion as allowed by the patient's pain. Better understanding of this injury has resulted in greater acceptance of surgical management of highly displaced variants. However, little agreement exists on indications for surgery, and there is no clear comparative evidence on outcomes for surgically versus nonsurgically managed fractures. Scapular fractures are the result of high-energy mechanisms of injury, and they often occur in conjunction with other traumatic injuries. In addition to performing meticulous physical and neurologic examination, the surgeon should obtain plain radiographs, including AP shoulder, axillary, and scapular Y views. Three-dimensional CT is used to determine accurate measurements in surgical candidates. Surgical approach, technique, and timing are individualized based on fracture type and other patient-related factors.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of a modified two-dimensional electrical inclinometer to measure scapular upward rotation during static humeral elevation. Numerous techniques have been proposed to qualitatively and quantitatively measure upward rotation of the scapula. These techniques are limited by expense or an inability to be synchronized with other measurements, such as muscle activity and force output. For validity testing, static scapular upward rotation was measured separately with a digital protractor and electrical inclinometer while participants were at rest and 60°, 90° and 120° of humeral elevation in the scapular plane. For reliability testing, either 20 min before or 20 min after validity testing, participants performed the testing positions while measurements were taken with the electrical inclinometer only. Significant correlations existed between the modified electrical inclinometer and digital protractor at all four positions (r>0.996, p<0.001). The electrical inclinometer demonstrated good to excellent intra-rater reliability (ICC(3,1)>0.892, 95%CI: 0.785-0.988 and SEM<1.8°). These results support the use of the electrical inclinometer to measure scapular upward rotation. These findings provide clinicians and researchers with a practical instrument that can accurately measure scapular upward rotation in synchrony with other measurements, such as electromyography and isokinetic data.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS AND BACKGROUND: Narrowing of the subacromial space has been implicated in several shoulder pathologies. However, the location of the minimum distance points during clinical testing has not been defined. We sought to measure the in vivo minimum distance and location of the minimum distance points on the acromion and proximal humerus during arm elevation. METHODS: Eight healthy male subjects (mean age, 30 years) underwent a dynamic in vivo biplane fluoroscopy assessment of scaption and forward elevation. For each frame, the 3-dimensional position and orientation of the humerus and scapula were determined, and the acromiohumeral distance (AHD) was measured as the shortest distance between the acromion and proximal humerus. RESULTS: The minimum AHD was 2.6 ± 0.8 mm during scaption and 1.8 ± 1.2 mm during forward flexion at elevation angles of 83° ± 13° and 97° ± 23°, respectively. The minimum distance point was located on the articular surface of the humeral head from the neutral arm position until 34° ± 8° for scaption and 36° ± 6° for forward flexion. Upon further elevation, the minimum distance point was located within the footprint of the supraspinatus muscle until 72° ± 12° for scaption and 65° ± 8° for forward flexion. At greater elevation angles, the minimum distance points were between the acromion and the proximal humeral shaft, distal from the greater tuberosity. CONCLUSIONS: The shortest AHD was at approximately 90° of arm elevation. The AHD was no longer measured intra-articularly or within the supraspinatus footprint above approximately 70° of arm elevation.

AB  - Following stroke, control of both the contralesional (paretic) and ipsilesional (less affected) arms is altered. The purpose of this study was to analyse the consequences of stroke on joint rotations of both shoulder girdles, that is, glenohumeral (GH) and scapula motion. Because of hemispheric specialization, we hypothesized that changes would relate to the side of hemisphere damage. Nine stroke patients with left, and 9 with right hemisphere damage (LHD and RHD) and 9 healthy subjects were included. Reaching movements to targets positioned close, far and high in three directions were recorded using an electromagnetic system. Initial and final postures of the scapula, GH and elbow joint were evaluated. Inter-joint rotations throughout the movements were analysed using principal component analysis (PCA). The main finding was that initial and final postures of the contralesional and ipsilesional shoulders differed depending on the side of brain lesion. On the contralesional side, there was less scapula protraction and GH lateral rotation for both groups. Scapula tilt was less anterior in LHD patients, and GH elevation was greater in RHD patients. On the ipsilesional side, GH lateral rotation was reduced in both groups, and scapula protraction was reduced only for LHD patients. PCA confirmed that postures of both shoulders of the LHD group were substantially different to the healthy subjects, while only the contralesional arm of the RHD subjects differed. These results add to existing knowledge of hemispheric specialization, suggesting that the left hemisphere plays a greater role in bilateral joint postures than the right hemisphere.

AB  - To measure the scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) in outpatient settings, the motion analysis protocol named ISEO (INAIL Shoulder and Elbow Outpatient protocol) was developed, based on inertial and magnetic sensors. To complete the sensor-to-segment calibration, ISEO requires the involvement of an operator for sensor placement and for positioning the patient's arm in a predefined posture. Since this can affect the measure, this study aimed at quantifying ISEO intra- and inter-operator agreement. Forty subjects were considered, together with two operators, A and B. Three measurement sessions were completed for each subject: two by A and one by B. In each session, the humerus and scapula rotations were measured during sagittal and scapular plane elevation movements. ISEO intra- and inter-operator agreement were assessed by computing, between sessions, the: (1) similarity of the scapulohumeral patterns through the Coefficient of Multiple Correlation (CMC(2)), both considering and excluding the difference of the initial value of the scapula rotations between two sessions (inter-session offset); (2) 95% Smallest Detectable Difference (SDD(95)) in scapula range of motion. Results for CMC(2) showed that the intra- and inter-operator agreement is acceptable (median&#8805;0.85, lower-whisker &#8805; 0.75) for most of the scapula rotations, independently from the movement and the inter-session offset. The only exception is the agreement for scapula protraction-retraction and for scapula medio-lateral rotation during abduction (inter-operator), which is acceptable only if the inter-session offset is removed. SDD(95) values ranged from 4.4° to 8.6° for the inter-operator and between 4.9° and 8.5° for the intra-operator agreement. In conclusion, ISEO presents a high intra- and inter-operator agreement, particularly with the scapula inter-session offset removed.

AB  - Fluoroscopic imaging, using single plane or dual plane images, has grown in popularity to measure dynamic in vivo human shoulder joint kinematics. However, no study has quantified the difference in spatial positional accuracy between single and dual plane image-model registration applied to the shoulder joint. In this paper, an automatic 2D-3D image-model registration technique was validated for accuracy and repeatability with single and dual plane fluoroscopic images. Accuracy was assessed in a cadaver model, kinematics found using the automatic registration technique were compared to those found using radiostereometric analysis. The in vivo repeatability of the automatic registration technique was assessed during the dynamic abduction motion of four human subjects. The in vitro data indicated that the error in spatial positional accuracy of the humerus and the scapula was less than 0.30mm in translation and less than 0.58° in rotation using dual plane images. Single plane accuracy was satisfactory for in-plane motion variables, but out-of-plane motion variables on average were approximately 8 times less accurate. The in vivo test indicated that the repeatability of the automatic 2D-3D image-model registration was 0.50mm in translation and 1.04° in rotation using dual images. For a single plane technique, the repeatability was 3.31mm in translation and 2.46° in rotation for measuring shoulder joint kinematics. The data demonstrate that accurate and repeatable shoulder joint kinematics can be obtained using dual plane fluoroscopic images with an automatic 2D-3D image-model registration technique; and that out-of-plane motion variables are less accurate than in-plane motion variables using a single plane technique.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiostereometric analysis measures the position of rigid bodies in 3 dimensions with very high precision and can be used to measure early micromotion of glenoid implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiostereometric analysis was used to measure migration of 11 partially cemented fluted pegged glenoid components in patients with osteoarthritis who underwent shoulder arthroplasty during a 2-year period. Patients were evaluated using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Constant scores and by a computed tomography (CT) scan at the 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: Migration patterns could be classified into 2 groups: The first group showed little if any migration, the second group rotated by 4° or more as early as 3 months after operation. The maximum total point motion reached up to 2 mm by the 6-month follow-up. At 12 months, the 2 groups could be identified by the presence or absence of focal lucency around the central peg. At the end of 2 years, CT scans were able to classify the same 2 migration patterns by the presence or absence of osseointegration around the cementless central peg of the glenoid implant. The clinical effect of the absence of osseointegration in this novel glenoid component is unknown because both groups had similar clinical results at 2 years. CONCLUSION: Rapid early migration associated with focal lucency and absence of osseointegration was observed in 6 of 11 components. We postulate that lack of initial fixation leads to early movement of the glenoid component and failure of osseointegration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinically evaluating the scapulothoracic joint is challenging. To identify scapular dyskinesis, clinicians typically observe scapular motion and congruence during self-directed upper extremity movements. However, it is unclear whether this method is reliable. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore determined the interrater reliability of a scapular classification system in the examination of professional baseball players. METHODS: Seventy-one healthy uninjured professional baseball players between the ages of 18 and 32 years volunteered to participate. We used a digital video camera to film five repetitions of scapular plane elevation while holding a 2-pound weight. Four examiners then independently classified the motions on video into one of four types. Interrater reliability analysis using the kappa (k) statistic was performed for: (1) classifying each scapula into one of the four types; (2) classifying each scapula as being abnormal (Types I-III) or normal (Type IV); and (3) classifying both scapula as both being symmetric (both normal or both abnormal) or asymmetric (one normal, one abnormal). RESULTS: We found low reliability for all analyses. In classifying each scapula as one of the four types, reliability was k = 0.245 for the left limb and k = 0.186 for the right limb. When considering the dichotomous classifications (abnormal versus normal), reliability was k = 0.264 for left and k = 0.157 for right. For bilateral symmetry/asymmetric, reliability was k = 0.084. CONCLUSION: We found low reliability of visual observation and classification of scapular movement. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Current evaluation strategies for evaluating subtle scapular abnormalities are limited. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, diagnostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment of glenoid inclination is of interest for a variety of conditions and procedures. The purpose of this study was to develop an accurate and reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on standardized anterior-posterior (AP) radiographs and on computed tomography (CT) images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three consistently identifiable angles were defined: Angle &#945; by line AB connecting the superior and inferior glenoid tubercle (glenoid fossa) and the line identifying the scapular spine; angle ß by line AB and the floor of the supraspinatus fossa; angle Î³ by line AB and the lateral margin of the scapula. Experimental study: these 3 angles were measured in function of the scapular position to test their resistance to rotation. Conventional AP radiographs and CT scans were acquired in extension/flexion and internal/external rotation in a range up to ±40°. Clinical study: the inter-rater reliability of all angles was assessed on AP radiographs and CT scans of 60 patients (30 with proximal humeral fractures, 30 with osteoarthritis) by 2 independent observers. RESULTS: The experimental study showed that angle &#945; and ß have a resistance to rotation of up to ±20°. The deviation from neutral position was not more than ±10°. The results for the inter-rater reliability analyzed by Bland-Altman plots for the angle ß fracture group were (mean ± standard deviation) -0.1 ± 4.2 for radiographs and -0.3 ± 3.3 for CT scans; and for the osteoarthritis group were -1.2 ± 3.8 for radiographs and -3.0 ± 3.6 for CT scans. CONCLUSION: Angle ß is the most reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on conventional AP radiographs, providing a resistance to positional variability of the scapula and a good inter-rater reliability.

AB  - Standard, beaded radiostereometric analysis (RSA) and markerless RSA often use computed tomography (CT) scans to create three-dimensional (3D) bone models. However, ethical concerns exist due to risks associated with CT radiation exposure. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of decreasing CT dosage on RSA accuracy. Four cadaveric shoulder specimens were scanned using a normal-dose CT protocol and two low-dose protocols, where the dosage was decreased by 89% and 98%. 3D computer models of the humerus and scapula were created using each CT protocol. Bi-planar fluoroscopy was used to image five different static glenohumeral positions and two dynamic glenohumeral movements, of which a total of five static and four dynamic poses were selected for analysis. For standard RSA, negligible differences were found in bead (0.21±0.31mm) and bony landmark (2.31±1.90mm) locations when the CT dosage was decreased by 98% (p-values>0.167). For markerless RSA kinematic results, excellent agreement was found between the normal-dose and lowest-dose protocol, with all Spearman rank correlation coefficients greater than 0.95. Average root mean squared errors of 1.04±0.68mm and 2.42±0.81° were also found at this reduced dosage for static positions. In summary, CT dosage can be markedly reduced when performing shoulder RSA to minimize the risks of radiation exposure. Standard RSA accuracy was negligibly affected by the 98% CT dose reduction and for markerless RSA, the benefits of decreasing CT dosage to the subject outweigh the introduced errors.

AB  - The aim of this study was to establish the optimal methodology for skin-fixed measurement of the scapula during dynamic movement. This was achieved by comparing an optimally positioned Scapula Tracker device (ST) to a previously described palpation device, taken as the true measure of scapular kinematics. These measurements were compared across a range of calibration positions, including the use of multiple calibration positions for a single movement, in order to establish an optimal calibration approach. Ten subjects' scapular motion was measured using this ST and a previously described Acromial Method (AM). The two datasets were compared at a standard, an optimal and a 'multiple' calibration position, thus allowing a direct comparison between two common skin-fixed methods to track the bony kinematics of the scapula across different calibration positions. A comparison was also made with a bone-fixed technique from the literature. At both the standard and optimal calibration positions the ST was shown to be the more accurate measure of internal rotation and posterior tilt, particularly above 100° of humerothoracic elevation. The ST errors were found to be acceptable in relation to clinically important levels. Calibration positions have been shown to have a significant effect on the errors of both skin-fixed measurement techniques and therefore the importance of correct calibration is highlighted. It has thus been shown that a ST can be used to accurately quantify scapular motion when appropriately calibrated for the range of motion being measured.

AB  - Although flexion is a common component of the routine clinical assessment of the shoulder the muscle recruitment patterns during this movement are not clearly understood making valid interpretation of potential muscle dysfunction problematic. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively examine shoulder muscle activity during flexion in order to compare the activity levels and recruitment patterns of shoulder flexor, scapular lateral rotator and rotator cuff muscles. Electromyographic (EMG) data were recorded from 12 shoulder muscles sites in 15 volunteers. Flexion was performed in standing in the sagittal plane at no load, 20%, and 60% of each subject's maximum load. EMG data were normalized to maximum values obtained during maximum voluntary contractions. Results indicated that anterior deltoid, pectoralis major, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, serratus anterior, upper, and lower trapezius were activated at similar moderate levels. However, subscapularis was activated at low levels and significantly lower than supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Similar activity patterns across time were demonstrated in the muscles that produce flexion torque, laterally rotate the scapula, as well as supraspinatus and infraspinatus, and did not change as flexion load increased. The onset of activity in supraspinatus and anterior deltoid occurred at the same time and prior to movement of the limb at all loads with infraspinatus activity also occurring prior to movement onset at the medium and high load conditions only. Posterior rotator cuff muscles appear to be counterbalancing anterior translational forces produced during flexion and it would appear that supraspinatus is one of the muscles that consistently "initiates" flexion.

AB  - Shoulder dislocation is an injury with potential long-term consequences that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Patient positioning and imperfect radiographic views may result in discomfort, added examination time, and problematic diagnosis. The scapular Y radiograph has been shown to be useful in diagnosing shoulder dislocation but is not considered sufficient in isolation. Using a synthetic bone shoulder model, we propose a novel technique wherein osseous landmarks are used to form angles that significantly improved diagnostic accuracy for shoulder dislocation, even in significantly rotated and otherwise indeterminate scapular Y radiographs.

AB  - The aims were to test the intraexaminer reproducibility and report the presence of specific clinical variables of scapular dyskinesis in cases with trapezius myalgia and healthy controls, along with general health and work ability. A total of 38 cases and 23 controls were tested for scapular dyskinesis, general health, and work ability, and 19 cases and 14 controls participated in the reproducibility study. Intraexaminer reproducibility was good to excellent for 6 of 10 clinical variables (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient [ICC] 0.76-0.91; kappa 0.84-1.00), and fair to good for four variables (ICC 0.42-0.74), test for muscular weakness having the lowest ICC (0.42). Cases showed significantly larger medial border misalignment, larger lower horizontal distance of the inferior scapular angle and larger passive shoulder internal rotation, by 110% (1.02 cm), 15% (1.38 cm), and 8% (5.5°), respectively. Cases with the highest degree of scapular dyskinesis showed reduced work ability and general health. The present specific clinical variables on scapular dyskinesis showed satisfactory intraexaminer reproducibility. An increased standardization must be implemented to increase reproducibility of tests for muscular weakness, and the interexaminer reproducibility must be tested for all variables. Finally, scapular dyskinesis in cases with trapezius myalgia must be followed longitudinally for clinical importance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The scapula locator method has associated intra-observer and inter-observer errors caused by the dependency on the observer to locate the scapular landmarks. The potential effect of the pressures applied by the observer on the measured scapular kinematics when this method is used has also been overlooked so far. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of using feedback on the pressures applied on the scapula using the locator on the intra-observer and inter-observer reliabilities of the method as well as on the kinematics obtained using this method. METHODS: Three observers tracked the scapular motion of the dominant shoulder of each subject using the locator with no reference to pressure-feedback for three trials of bilateral elevation in the scapular plane and using the locator with pressure-feedback for three other trials. Variations between the measurements obtained were used to calculate the intra-observer errors and variations between the measurements obtained by the three observers for the same subject were used to calculate inter-observer errors. Repeated-measures ANOVA tests were used to look at differences between the two methods in terms of intra-observer and inter-observer errors and scapular kinematics. FINDINGS: Using pressure-feedback reduced the intra-observer errors but had no effect on the inter-observer errors. Different scapular kinematics was measured using the two methods. INTERPRETATIONS: Pressure-feedback improves the reliability of the scapula locator method. Differences in the scapular kinematics suggest that unregulated pressures have an effect on the physiological scapular motion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Scapular dyskinesis is a major etiological factor in overhead athletes' shoulder problems. Our hypotheses were to evaluate if (1) visual observation of scapular dyskinesis during scaption has substantial interobserver reliability, and (2) scapular dyskinesis may be induced by swim training in pain-free swimmers. DESIGN: A reliability and observational study. SETTING: Bachelor project at a college institution and at a private sports orthopedic hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-eight competitive swimmers with no history of shoulder pain were included in the study. Fourteen swimmers were evaluated regarding reliability. Inclusion criteria were competitive swimmers with high training volume who previously had no shoulder pain. INTERVENTIONS: Observations of scapular dyskinesis (yes/no) during simple scaption. The interobserver reliability of scaption and wall push-up was evaluated in 14 swimmers using kappa analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of scapular dyskinesis at 4 time intervals during a swim training session. RESULTS: The scaption test resulted in a weighted kappa value of 0.75. Scapular dyskinesis was seen in 29 shoulders (37%) after the first time interval, in another 24 (cumulated prevalence 68%) after one-half of the training session, and in an additional 4 swimmers (cumulated prevalence 73%) after three-quarters of the training session. During the last quarter of the training session, another 7 swimmers had dyskinesis, resulting in a cumulated prevalence of 82%. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of abnormal scapular kinesis during a normal training session is high in previously pain-free swimmers. The prevalence increases with more training and occurs early during the training session.

AB  - This study describes the reliability of a protocol for upper limb three-dimensional movement analysis (UL-3DMA) in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP). The UL-3DMA is based on the ISB-recommendations, and contains a set of functional and clinically relevant tasks. Tasks were selected to reflect the characteristic movement deficits seen in children with HCP. The protocol consists of three reach tasks (forwards, upwards, sideways); two reach-to-grasp tasks (with objects requiring different hand orientations); and three gross motor tasks. Within and between session reliability was tested in a group of 12 children with HCP, aged 6-15 years. Reliability of movement duration/speed and joint angles at endpoint was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient; similarity of the waveforms with the coefficient of multiple correlation. Measurement errors were calculated for all parameters. Results indicated good within and between session reliability for movement duration/speed. Trunk, scapula, shoulder, elbow and wrist angles at endpoint generally showed moderately high to very high reliability. High levels of reliability were also found for scapula, shoulder and elbow waveforms and lower levels for the wrist and trunk. Within and between session measurement errors were below 5° and 7°, respectively, for most kinematic parameters. Joint angles in the transverse plane, as well as wrist flexion generally showed higher between session errors (7-10°). This study indicates that the proposed protocol is a reliable tool to quantify upper limb movements in children with HCP, providing a sound base for its clinical application. Further research is needed to establish the discriminative ability of the UL-3DMA.

AB  - The acromial tracker is used to measure scapular rotations during dynamic movements. The method has low accuracy in high elevations and is sensitive to its attachment location on the acromion. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the attachment position and shoulder orientation during calibration on the tracker accuracy. The tracker was attached to one of three positions: near the anterior edge of the acromion process, just above the acromial angle and the meeting point between the acromion and the scapular spine. The scapula locator was used to track the scapula during bilateral abduction simultaneously. The locator was used to calibrate the tracker at: no abduction, 30°, 60°, 90° and 120° humerothoracic abduction. ANOVA tests compared RMS errors for different attachment positions and calibration angles. The results showed that attaching the device at the meeting point between the acromion and the scapular spine gave the smallest errors and it was best to calibrate the device at 60° for elevations &#8804;90°, at 120° for elevations >90° and at 90°or 120° for the full range of abduction. The accuracy of the tracker is significantly improved if attached appropriately and calibrated for the range of movement being measured.

AB  - Abnormal scapular movement is widely believed to be an important factor in clinical pathology of the shoulder joint complex. Validated non-invasive techniques for measuring scapular movement have been developed, but the effect of marker placement on accuracy is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy and reliability of different groupings of markers to achieve the best accuracy and reliability for measuring scapular kinematics. Eight healthy young adult subjects were recruited. An optoelectronic marker grid was applied to the skin overlying the scapula. Two bone pins with optoelectronic marker carriers were inserted into the scapula. The accuracy of six surface marker configurations was determined by comparing the measured kinematics with scapular bone pins (the gold standard). Four humeral movements were tested: glenohumeral abduction, glenohumeral horizontal adduction, hand behind back, and forward reaching. All three rotations had a significant difference in the accuracy of the patches (p = 0.04 to p < 0.0001). For posterior tipping there was a significant effect of movement (p = 0.003) and a significant interaction (p < 0.0001). There was also a significant interaction for external rotation (p = 0.001). The marker grouping with the largest cranio-caudal spread had the highest accuracy for measuring posterior tilting (RMS 1.9°). Markers closer to the scapular spine were more accurate for tracking external rotation (RMS 2.0°) while an intermediate grouping of markers were most accurate for quantifying upward rotation (RMS 1.9°). The reliability between days ranged between 3.8° and 7.5° (based on RMS difference between trials) and there was a significant interaction between patch and movement (p < 0.0001). Intraclass correlation coefficients show moderate to good agreement for most arm movements and scapular rotations. Thus, there exists distinct optimal configurations of non-invasive marker locations for accurately measuring scapular kinematics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) indicates a 20° or greater loss of internal rotation of the throwing shoulder compared with the nondominant shoulder. PURPOSE: To determine whether GIRD and a deficit in total rotational motion (external rotation + internal rotation) compared with the nonthrowing shoulder correlate with shoulder injuries in professional baseball pitchers. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Over 3 competitive seasons (2005 to 2007), passive range of motion measurements were evaluated on the dominant and nondominant shoulders for 170 pitcher-seasons. This included 122 professional pitchers during the 3 seasons of data collection, in which some pitchers were measured during multiple seasons. Ranges of motion were measured with a bubble goniometer during the preseason, by the same examiner each year. External and internal rotation of the glenohumeral joint was assessed with the participant supine and the arm abducted 90° in the plane of the scapula, with the scapula stabilized anteriorly at the coracoid process. The reproducibility of the test methods had an intraclass correlation coefficient of .81. Days in which the player was unable to participate because of injury or surgery were recorded during the season by the medical staff of the team and defined as an injury. RESULTS: Pitchers with GIRD (n = 40) were nearly twice as likely to be injured as those without but without statistical significance (P = .17). Pitchers with total rotational motion deficit greater than 5° had a higher rate of injury. Minor league pitchers were more likely than major league pitchers to be injured. However, when players were injured, major league pitchers missed a significantly greater number of games than minor league pitchers. CONCLUSION: Compared with pitchers without GIRD, pitchers with GIRD appear to be at a higher risk for injury and shoulder surgery.

AB  - The most recent non-invasive methods for the recording of scapular motion are based on an acromion marker (AM) set and a single calibration (SC) of the scapula in a resting position. However, this method fails to accurately measure scapular kinematics above 90° of arm elevation, due to soft tissue artifacts of the skin and muscles covering the acromion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy, and inter-trial and inter-session repeatability of a double calibration method (DC) in comparison with SC. The SC and DC data were measured with an optoelectronic system during arm flexion and abduction at different angles of elevation (0-180°). They were compared with palpation of the scapula using a scapula locator. DC data was not significantly different from palpation for 5/6 axes of rotation tested (Y, X, and Z in abduction and flexion), where as SC showed significant differences for 5/6 axes. The root mean square errors ranged from 2.96° to 4.48° for DC and from 6° to 9.19° for SC. The inter-trial repeatability was good to excellent for SC and DC. The inter-session repeatability was moderate to excellent for SC and moderate to good for DC. Coupling AM and DC is an easy-to-use method, which yields accurate and reliable measurements of scapular kinematics for the complete range of arm motion. It can be applied to the measurement of shoulder motion in many fields (sports, orthopaedics, and rehabilitation), especially when large ranges of arm motion are required.

AB  - Measuring the motion of the scapula and humerus with sub-millimeter levels of accuracy in six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) is a challenging problem. The current methods to measure shoulder joint motion via the skin do not produce clinically significant levels of accuracy. Thus, the purpose of this study was to validate a non-invasive markerless dual fluoroscopic imaging system (DFIS) model-based tracking technique for measuring dynamic in-vivo shoulder kinematics. Our DFIS tracks the positions of bones based on their projected silhouettes to contours on recorded pairs of fluoroscopic images. For this study, we compared markerlessly tracking the bones of the scapula and humerus to track them with implanted titanium spheres using a radiostereometric analysis (RSA) while manually manipulating a cadaver specimen's arms. Additionally, we report the repeatability of the DFIS to track the scapula and humerus during dynamic shoulder motion. The difference between the markerless model-based tracking technique and the RSA was ±0.3 mm in translation and ±0.5° in rotation. Furthermore, the repeatability of the markerless DFIS model-based tracking technique for the scapula and humerus was ±0.2 mm and ±0.4°, respectively. The model-based tracking technique achieves an accuracy that is similar to an invasive RSA tracking technique and is highly suited for non-invasively studying the in-vivo motion of the shoulder. This technique could be used to investigate the scapular and humeral biomechanics in both healthy individuals and in patients with various pathologies under a variety of dynamic shoulder motions encountered during the activities of daily living.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Glenoid orientation likely plays an important role in shoulder mechanics and has been associated with glenohumeral instability, rotator cuff tears, and total shoulder arthroplasty outcome. Glenoid version and inclination measurements are widely used, but these measurements are 2-dimensional, and orientation of the central face must be inferred from 2 points on the outer rim. This study tested the hypothesis that sphere fitting provides an optimal assessment of glenoid face 3-dimensional orientation, and clinically important differences will exist in some individuals between sphere fit orientation and traditional version measurement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computed tomography scans of 20 normal glenoids were obtained. Glenoid version was measured from resliced, pure transverse images at a series of glenoid heights. Separately, the 3-dimensional surface of each glenoid face was reconstructed. A sphere was fit to the glenoid face, and its orientation was described by 2 angles analogous to version and inclination. RESULTS: "Sphere fit version" averaged -3.2° ± 3.4° (negative indicating retroversion), and "sphere fit inclination" averaged 1.3° ± 4.7°. Absolute differences between sphere fit version and the standard mid-glenoid version averaged 1.5° (maximum 4.0°) across patients. The glenoids were, on average, 5.5° more retroverted at the 80% height than at the 20% height. DISCUSSION: Three-dimensional aspects of the glenoid, including the spiraling twist evidenced by increased retroversion superiorly, are accounted for in this novel sphere-fitting approach for assessing glenoid orientation. CONCLUSIONS: For most normal glenoids, midglenoid version appears to provide an adequate measure of glenoid central face orientation. Sphere fitting has potential utility in optimizing glenoid implant alignment in total shoulder arthroplasty.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the reproducibility and safety of a novel arthroscopic technique combining a Bristow-Latarjet procedure with a Bankart repair and to report the early clinical and radiologic results. METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive patients with glenoid bone loss and capsular deficiency were treated with this all-arthroscopic technique; six patients had a failed arthroscopic capsulolabral repair. The coracoid fragment was osteotomized, passed with the conjoined tendon through the subscapularis muscle, and fixed in the standing position with a cannulated screw on the abraded glenoid neck. The capsule and labrum were then reattached on the glenoid rim, leaving the coracoid bone block in an extra-articular position. Potential intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded. All patients were reviewed and had postoperative radiographs; 35 had computed tomography scans. RESULTS: The procedure was performed entirely arthroscopically in 41 of 47 patients (88%); a conversion to open surgery was needed in 6 patients (12%). The axillary nerve was identified in all cases, and no neurologic injuries were observed. No patient had any recurrence of instability at the most recent follow-up (mean, 16 months). The mean Rowe score was 88 ± 16.7, and the mean Walch-Duplay score was 87.6 ± 12.9. The Subjective Shoulder Value was 87.5% ± 12.7%. The bone block was subequatorial in 98% of the cases (46 of 47) and flush to the glenoid surface in 92% (43 of 47); it was too lateral in 1 (2%) and too medial (>5 mm) in 3 (6%). There was 1 bone block fracture and 7 migrations. CONCLUSIONS: The arthroscopic Bristow-Latarjet-Bankart procedure is reproducible and safe. This procedure allows restoration of shoulder stability in patients with glenoid bone loss and capsular deficiency, as well as in the case of failed capsulolabral repair. Arthroscopy offers the advantage of providing adequate visualization of both the glenohumeral joint and the anterior neck of the scapula, allowing accurate placement of the bone block and screw. Surgeons should be aware that the procedure is technically difficult and potentially dangerous because of the proximity of the brachial plexus and axillary vessels. Training on cadaveric specimens and transition from open to mini-open and, finally, to all arthroscopic is recommended. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

AB  - REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: The function of the forelimb is fundamental to understanding both sound and pathological locomotion. The precise movements of the equine shoulder are hidden by layers of skin and muscle and hence the shoulder is normally modelled as a simple pivot during locomotion which assumes that any translational motion is negligible. OBJECTIVES: To record and quantify the sliding motion of the scapula during locomotion, using a novel imaging technique. METHODS: Scapula motion during locomotion in the horse was calculated by tracking the ripple of the shoulder blade's movement under an array of markers placed over the soft tissue. RESULTS: Interstride variability was low. Sliding of up to 80 mm in the plane of progression (cranio-caudal) was observed; however, the limits of motion varied by <5 mm in the gaits examined, despite variations in stride length. Stride length appeared to be increased by scapula rotation in the plane of progression, and this flexion-extension was largest in trot and was not significantly different between walk and canter. This was in agreement with the distance travelled by the trunk whilst the hoof was on the ground. Substantial sliding in a dorsal-ventral direction was shown and varied with the gait used, both in magnitude and timing, possibly providing a shock absorption mechanism. The sliding did not increase as much as would be expected in canter and this coincided with a more lateral positioning of the scapula and increased impact on the ribcage. CONCLUSIONS: It has been assumed that scapula-thoracic sliding increases stride length and hence economically increases locomotor speed. The extra motion of the scapula recorded appeared to absorb shock from forelimb impact and maintain the economy of locomotion, but did not increase with speed and the muscular pretensioning implied could actually impair ventilation.

AB  - Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) has been reported to be associated with a complication rate that is four times that of conventional total shoulder arthroplasty. It is the purpose of this article to identify and understand the most common and most serious complications of RTSA and to review current methods of prevention and treatment. The current literature was reviewed to identify type and prevalence of reported complications and to identify risk factors, preventive measures as well as technical details for management strategies for complications of RTSA. The variable accuracy of reporting and the heterogeneity of methodology in the literature limited our study, however, a definitive ranking of most to least common complication emerged. The currently identified most common complication is scapular notching. The clinically most relevant complications are infection, instability and acromial fractures. Haematoma formation used to be very frequent but can be controlled, glenoid component loosening, however, is rare when compared with conventional total shoulder replacement. In conclusion, RTSA is associated with a high rate of complications. Their incidence and the results of their treatment are inconsistently reported. To document and then prevent complications, a standardised monitoring tool including clear definitions and assessment instructions appears necessary.

AB  - The pathomechanics of the throwing shoulder have yet to be fully elucidated. The focus of this study reported here was to further characterize the morphology of the glenoid in a population of elite throwing athletes. We obtained magnetic resonance imaging scans of 38 professional baseball players (dominant shoulders) and of 35 age matched nonthrowing control patients (17 dominant and 18 nondominant shoulders). Seven measurements were made by 3 blinded reviewers on 3 axial images per patient: version of superior glenoid, middle glenoid, inferior glenoid, superior capsulolabral junction, middle capsulolabral junction, inferior capsulolabral junction, and depth of concavity of glenoid in a middle slice. Mean age of the 38 players (24 pitchers, 14 fielders) was 26.8 years, and mean age of the 35 control patients was 27.6 years. Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from .55 to .84 for the version measurements. There were no statistically significant differences between the pitchers and the fielders on any of the 7 measurements, but such differences were found between the throwers and the dominant-shoulder control patients on all 7 measurements. There were only 2 differences (version of superior glenoid, depth of concavity of glenoid in a middle slice) between dominant- and nondominant- shoulder control patients. There was significantly more retroversion in the osseous and soft tissues of the elite throwing athletes than in the nonthrowing control patients. This increased retroversion may play a role in development of internal impingement in the overhead athlete.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Because the human shoulder has many degrees of freedom that allow redundant means of producing the same net humerothoracic motion, there are many impediments to objective, repeatable assessment of shoulder function in vivo. Devices designed to date have suffered from poor reliability. In this study we introduce a new device and methods to evaluate human shoulder kinematics and evaluate its reproducibility from subject to subject and from day to day. METHODS: This was a controlled laboratory study. Using electromagnetic motion sensors to record the position and orientation of the thorax, scapula, and humerus, we quantified the kinematic response of twenty four normal shoulders in response to known internal-external torque application. A four-parameter logistic function was selected to characterize the strident features of the torque-rotation relationship. FINDINGS: Our analysis in conjunction with the measurement technique described herein, allowed the passive glenohumeral internal-external range of motion to be differentiated from other motion components and was determined to within 9.6% of full scale over three repeated trials. Range of motion was the most reliable biomechanical outcome, more so than computed indices of glenohumeral flexibility and hysteresis. The exact profile of the torque-rotation response, and therefore the repeatability of the calculated outcomes, was unique from shoulder to shoulder. INTERPRETATION: The development of the capacity for precise, non-invasive measurement of shoulder biomechanics over time is a requisite step towards optimizing treatment of shoulder injury and disease. Our current methods are superior to previous attempts at trying to non-invasively evaluate the biomechanics of the glenohumeral joint.

AB  - CLINICAL QUESTION: The systematic review focused on various index tests for the shoulder. We concentrated on the subscapularis tendon results to determine the accuracy of reported index tests for clinically diagnosing subscapularis integrity. DATA SOURCES: Studies were identified by an OVID search using MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, and CINHAL databases (1966-2006) and a hand search by 2 authors (E.J.H. and S.C.). Primary search terms were shoulder, examination, and diagnosis. In addition to the database searches, personal files were hand searched by one of the authors (E.J.H.) for publications, posters, and abstracts. The reference lists in review articles were cross-checked, and all individual names of each special test were queried using MEDLINE and PubMed. STUDY SELECTION: The search was limited to English-language journals. Studies were eligible for inclusion if the criterion standard was surgery, magnetic resonance imaging, or injection (subacromial or acromioclavicular joint); at least 1 physical examination test or special test was studied; and one of the paired statistics of sensitivity and specificity was reported or could be determined. Excluded were studies in which the index test was performed under anesthesia or in cadavers, studies in which the index test was assigned the status of composite physical examination, and review articles. Studies were grouped according to the subscapularis index test assessed: lift off, internal-rotation lag sign, Napoleon sign, bear hug, belly off, and belly press. DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were selected in a 2-stage process. First, all abstracts and articles found through the search process were independently reviewed by 2 authors (E.J.H. and S.C.). Disagreement on inclusion of an article was resolved by consensus. Second, each selected study was assessed by each reviewer independently. A third reviewer made the final decision on any disagreements for the selected studies. The primary outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios. The quality of a study was determined by assessing its internal and external validity. Validity was determined by the primary author (E.J.H.) using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) statement. Our work required data extraction from the original articles, which we used to generate 2 x 2 contingency tables for each index test. Pooled indices of clinical usefulness were then determined for each index test. MAIN RESULTS: The specific search criteria identified 922 articles for review. Of these, 4 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for subscapularis tendon tears, resulting in the number of studies assessing each index test as follows: 4 for lift off, 2 for internal-rotation lag sign, 2 for Napoleon sign, 1 for bear hug, 1 for belly off, and 1 for belly press. Subscapularis tears were identified by the criterion standard of surgery to visually assess the torn fibers. Across all 4 studies, a total of 304 shoulders were examined, 95 of which had a subscapularis tear (45 full thickness, 50 partial thickness), and 106 were injury free. Indices of clinical usefulness for full-thickness and partial-thickness subscapularis tears are reported in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alteration of normal scapulohumeral rhythm due to the fatigue of scapular-stabilizing muscles induces decrease of rotator cuff strength. In this study we analyzed the interobserver and intraobserver realibility of the infraspinatus strength test (IST) and infraspinatus scapular retraction test (ISRT) in 29 overhead athletes with scapular dyskinesis, before and after 6 months of scapular musculature rehabilitation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of labral injuries (2 cases, 5%) and cuff tears (4 cases, 11%) were excluded. Scapular dyskinesis patterns were evaluated according to Kibler et al. (J Shoulder Elbow Surg 11:550-556, 2002). We found a type I dyskinesis in 24 cases (83%) and a type II in 5 cases (17%). Patients were tested by using IST and ISRT and the maximum infraspinatus strength (kg) was registered by a handheld dynamometer. Changes in shoulder IR were measured by using a standard goniometry. Rehabilitation continued for 6 months and was focused on the restoration of scapular muscular control and balance. We used a paired Student t test for the significance of the force values (alpha = 0.01). Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error (SE) were applied to determine the realibility of repeated values collected within testers and between testers. RESULTS: Values of ICC close to 1 at baseline and at 6 months indicated a higher interexaminer and intraexaminer realibility. IST force values registered a significant increase at 6 months for both examiners (P < 0.01). The mean difference between IST and ISRT values were not significant at 6 months (P > 0.01). The increase of glenohumeral internal rotation was significant at 6 months (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The good realibility and the easy reproducibility make the ISRT an excellent test to assess patients with infraspinatus weakness due to scapular dyskinesis and address them toward an appropriate program of rehabilitation aimed to restore scapular musculature balance and control.

AB  - Physiological tremor and strength during the maintenance of shoulder position occur during a precision aiming task, such as archery. It is unclear how positions for precision demands affect physiological tremor and associated muscular activities. The purpose of this study was to assess the tremor amplitude and muscular activities of the shoulder between the various positions for precision demands. Ten males (age 21.9 +/- 2.0 years) participated in the study. Electromyography (EMG) was quantified on eight humeral/scapular muscles. The tremor was measured by the acceleration component of a motion tracking sensor in the 3-7 Hz and 8-12 Hz frequency bands. Participants simulated six preparatory archery shooting positions (3 arm angles x 2 arm draw positions) and performed isometric contractions. The relative root mean square (RMS) amplitudes of the shoulder muscles were significantly greater for the full drawing position compared with the partial position (humeral muscles: P = 0.011; scapular muscles: P = 0.026). In the full drawing position, increased humeral/scapular muscle EMG amplitude was moderately associated with an increased power spectrum of 8-12/3-7 Hz tremor in humerus/scapula motion (R = 0.43-0.57). To minimize fluctuations in high strength muscle performance, 90 degrees of elevation in the full drawing position may be a suitable position for demands in archery. In addition, scapular muscle amplitude is important for stability to reduce humerus tremor during archery performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate analysis of osseous glenoid morphology is important in treating glenohumeral arthritis and instability. Two-dimensional computed tomography scans are used to evaluate glenoid alignment. Accuracy of this method is dependent on the angle of axial reconstruction in relation to the position of the scapula. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of scapular rotation in the coronal and sagittal planes on glenoid version as measured on two-dimensional images. METHODS: Computer-generated three-dimensional models of scapulae from computed tomography scans of thirty-six shoulders in whole-body cadavers were generated. The anatomic geometry of these models had been previously validated. The position of the scapulae relative to the gantry was determined. The three-dimensional models were rotated in 1 degree increments in the coronal and sagittal planes. Glenoid version was measured on two-dimensional images for each of the rotation increments. Version variability at each rotation increment was calculated. RESULTS: The anatomic glenoid version (independent of the resting position of the scapula) was an average (and standard deviation) of 2.0 degrees +/- 3.8 degrees of retroversion. The average difference between anatomic glenoid version and clinical glenoid version (depending on the position of the scapula on the original computed tomography axial images) was 6.9 degrees +/- 5.6 degrees (range, 0.1 degrees to 22.5 degrees). Version variability with coronal or sagittal rotation was significant for all degrees of rotation (p < 0.0001). Scapular abduction had the greatest effect on version variation and resulted in 0.42 degrees of relative anteversion for every 1 degree of abduction in the coronal plane. In the sagittal plane, internal rotation resulted in relative anteversion. CONCLUSIONS: Any malalignment of > or = 1 degree of the scapula in the coronal or sagittal plane will create inaccuracies in measuring glenoid version. The plane of axial reconstruction should be aligned with the scapula when two-dimensional computed tomography images are used to measure glenoid version. These findings support the use of three-dimensional models to evaluate glenoid version.

AB  - When performing radiostereometric analysis (RSA), computed tomography scans are often taken to obtain the landmarks used to create anatomical coordinate systems (CSs) for quantifying joint kinematics. Different conventions for defining CSs lead to an inability to compare results among studies. The International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) has proposed a set of CSs; however, the landmarks needed to create the recommended scapular CS require the entire scapula to be scanned, thereby also exposing breast and other tissues to radiation. The main purpose of this work was to investigate an alternate definition of the CS that has repeatably attainable landmarks and axes as close as possible to those recommended by the ISB, while limiting the portion of the scapula requiring scanning. Intra- and inter-investigator variabilities of landmark digitization were quantified in one model of a scapula and one cadaveric specimen. Based on the variability of the digitizations, an alternative CS was defined. The differences between the ISB and alternative CSs were evaluated on 11 cadaveric specimens. Beaded biplanar RSA was performed on the glenohumeral joint model in 15 different configurations and the resulting kinematics were calculated for each set of landmark digitizations using both sets of coordinate systems. While the kinematic angles obtained using the alternative CS were statistically different from those obtained using the ISB standard, these differences were small (on the order of 5 degrees) and therefore considered to be of little clinical significance. In all likelihood, the benefits of decreasing radiation exposure outweigh these differences in angles.

AB  - The understanding and treatment of shoulder instability comprise a rapidly evolving area of interest in orthopaedics. Evaluation methods are becoming more specific in showing the exact pathologies causing the symptoms. Magnetic resonance arthrography and arthroscopy have contributed to this development. The patient with an unstable shoulder should be thoroughly evaluated through their history and specific clinical tests of the shoulder as well as the scapulothoracic joint. Often, shoulder instability can be classified after this primary evaluation. Magnetic resonance arthrography and arthroscopy are the gold standards in soft-tissue evaluation, whereas specialized radiographic examinations and computed tomography scans are used to assess bony defects. Patients are treated according to the pathology found on preoperative or pretreatment evaluation. Multiple factors need to be considered before the treatment program is instituted, including the patient's age, activity demands, associated pathology and dysfunction, soft-tissue pathology, degree of instability, direction, frequency, and etiology. Treatment can be nonoperative or arthroscopic or open repair. Soft-tissue pathology and bony defects should be addressed, and the surgeon's preferred method and skills are important in choosing the right treatment for the patient. The patient should be informed about possible complications, restrictions during the treatment period, and the prognosis for the particular type of instability. To improve progress in shoulder orthopaedics, one of the most important factors can be a universal agreement on an outcome measurement tool that is well designed and validated.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Before and after intervention trials. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of cervical muscular fatigue on joint position sense. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although fatigue-related degradation of proprioceptive acuity at lower and upper limbs is well documented, to date no study has investigated whether muscular fatigue induced at the neck could modify joint position sense. METHODS: A total of 9 young healthy adults were asked to perform the cervicocephalic relocation test to the neutral head position, that is, to relocate the head on the trunk, as accurately as possible, after full active cervical rotation to the left and right sides. This experimental task was executed in 2 conditions of No fatigue and Fatigue of the scapula elevator muscles. Absolute and variable errors were used to assess the cervical joint repositioning accuracy and consistency, respectively. RESULTS: Less accurate and less consistent repositioning performances were observed in Fatigue relative to No fatigue condition, as indicated by increased absolute and variable errors, respectively. CONCLUSION: Results of the present experiment evidence that cervical joint position sense, assessed through the cervicocephalic relocation test to the neutral head position, is degraded by muscular fatigue.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of the moiré fringe projection technique (MFPT) to quantify the scapular motions relative to the thorax. This system was composed of a LCD projector, a digital photographic camera, and a microcomputer. To automatically obtain the scapular profiles, the phase shifting method was combined with the MFPT. Four fringes were projected on the scapula and four on the reference planes. By the simple subtraction of the reference values from the scapular phase maps, the map due to the moiré fringes could be digitally obtained. After the phase decoding, the tridimensional (3D) profiles were obtained without prior information about the samples and the calculations of the scapular kinematics were carried out using dedicated software. On average, the movements of lateral rotation ranged from -1.8+/-6.1 degrees to -26.5+/-3.5 degrees; the protraction from 28.4+/-4.7 degrees to 27.7+/-6.8 degrees, and the posterior tilt from -6.4+/-7.8 degrees to -21.7+/-6.1 degrees, during the arm elevation in the scapular plane performed by six healthy subjects. For the test-retest reliability, the intra-class correlation coefficients ranged from 0.92 to 0.997 and the maximum estimated error was 0.8%. The MFPT allowed the scapular 3D measurements to be obtained in a digital and non-invasive manner. The main advantages compared with other existing systems were its ease in implementation, the use of standard optical components, and its possible clinical applications.

AB  - CONTEXT: Symptomatic scapulothoracic bursitis and crepitus are disorders of the scapulothoracic articulation that are often poorly understood. They can be a source of persistent pain and dysfunction in the active overhead throwing athlete. It is important to distinguish between scapulothoracic bursitis and scapulothoracic crepitus. Scapulothoracic bursitis refers to inflammation of the bursae secondary to trauma or overuse owing to sports activities or work. Scapulothoracic crepitus is defined by a grinding, popping, or thumping sound or sensation secondary to abnormal scapulothoracic motion. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This article presents the causes, diagnosis, and management of these shoulder conditions in a manner that is relevant to clinicians, athletic trainers, and physical therapists, and it reviews relevant studies to determine the consensus on nonoperative treatment, as well as open and arthroscopic surgical treatment. RESULTS: The causes of scapulothoracic bursitis and crepitus include direct or indirect trauma, overuse syndromes, glenohumeral joint dysfunction, osseous abnormalities, muscle atrophy or fibrosis, and idiopathic causes. Scapulothoracic bursitis and crepitus remain primarily clinical diagnoses; however, imaging studies or local injections may also be helpful. The initial treatment of scapulothoracic bursitis and scapulothoracic crepitus should be nonoperative. Surgical treatment options include partial scapulectomy or resection of the superomedial angle of the scapula, open bursal resection, and arthroscopic bursectomy. Despite the lack of agreement among orthopaedic surgeons concerning which procedure is best for treating symptomatic scapulothoracic bursitis and crepitus, most reports have demonstrated good to excellent outcomes in a significantly high percentage of patients. CONCLUSION: Clearly, the best initial approach to these conditions is a nonoperative treatment plan that combines scapular strengthening, postural reeducation, and core strength endurance. The addition of local modalities, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, and localized injections may also be helpful. If an appropriate trial of nonoperative management proves unsuccessful, surgical correction can produce good results.

AB  - Optoelectronic tracking systems are rarely used in 3D studies examining shoulder movements including the scapula. Among the reasons is the important slippage of skin markers with respect to scapula. Methods using electromagnetic tracking devices are validated and frequently applied. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a new method for in vivo optoelectronic scapular capture dealing with the accepted accuracy issues of validated methods. Eleven arm positions in three anatomical planes were examined using five subjects in static mode. The method was based on local optimisation, and recalculation procedures were made using a set of five scapular surface markers. The scapular rotations derived from the recalculation-based method yielded RMS errors comparable with the frequently used electromagnetic scapular methods (RMS up to 12.6° for 150° arm elevation). The results indicate that the present method can be used under careful considerations for 3D kinematical studies examining different shoulder movements.

AB  - Numerous techniques have been employed to monitor humeral head translation due to its involvement with several shoulder pathologies. However, most of the techniques were not validated. The objective of this study is to compare the accuracy of manual digitization and contour registration in measuring superior translation of the humeral head. Eight pairs of cadaver scapulae and humerii bones were harvested for this study. Each scapula and humerus was secured in a customized jig that allowed for control of humeral head translations and a vise that permitted rotations of the scapula about three axes. Fluoroscopy was used to take images of the shoulder bones. Scapular orientation was manipulated in different positions while the humerus was at 90 degrees of humeral elevation in the scapular plane. Humeral head translation was measured using the two methods and was compared to the known translation. Additionally, accuracy of the contour registration method to measure 2-D scapular rotations was assessed. The range for the root mean square (RMS) error for manual digitization method was 0.27 mm-0.43 mm and the contour registration method had a RMS error ranging from 0.18 mm-0.40 mm. In addition, the RMS error for the scapular angle rotation using the contour registration method was 2.4 degrees . Both methods showed acceptable errors. However, on average, the contour registration method showed lesser measurement error compared to the manual digitization method. In addition, the contour registration method was able to show good accuracy in measuring rotation that is useful in 2-D image analysis.

AB  - Several algorithms have been proposed for determining the centre of rotation of ball joints. These algorithms are used rather to locate the hip joint centre. Few studies have focused on the determination of the glenohumeral joint centre. However, no studies have assessed the accuracy and repeatability of functional methods for glenohumeral joint centre. This paper aims at evaluating the accuracy and the repeatability with which the glenohumeral joint rotation centre (GHRC) can be estimated in vivo by functional methods. The reference joint centre is the glenohumeral anatomical centre obtained by medical imaging. Five functional methods were tested: the algorithm of Gamage and Lasenby (2002), bias compensated (Halvorsen, 2003), symmetrical centre of rotation estimation (Ehrig et al., 2006), normalization method (Chang and Pollard, 2007), helical axis (Woltring et al., 1985). The glenohumeral anatomical centre (GHAC) was deduced from the fitting of the humeral head. Four subjects performed three cycles of three different movements (flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and circumduction). For each test, the location of the glenohumeral joint centre was estimated by the five methods. Analyses focused on the 3D location, on the repeatability of location and on the accuracy by computing the Euclidian distance between the estimated GHRC and the GHAC. For all the methods, the error repeatability was inferior to 8.25 mm. This study showed that there are significant differences between the five functional methods. The smallest distance between the estimated joint centre and the centre of the humeral head was obtained with the method of Gamage and Lasenby (2002).

AB  - To evaluate the exactitude, precision, reliability, sensitivity and specificity of Scapular Photographic Analysis (SPA Test) for the diagnosis of scapular dyskinesis. Material and Methods: We realized a study of reproducibility and diagnostic capability of SPA test for scapular dyskinesis. Reproducibility was assessed with exactitude (correlation of pairs), precision and reability (Intraclass correlation coefficient) in 26 healthy subjects. Subsequently, two independent operators evaluated and classified a group of patients as tehe presence or absence of scapular dyskinesis, defined as scapular asymmetry. Finally, we evaluated the diagnostic capability of the test (sensitivity, specificity) in 11 patients with scapular dyskinesis and 11 healthy controls. Was considered significant p < 0,05. The data were analyzed using STATA 9. Results: The average exactitude of the method was 81,97 +/- 1,57 percent, the precision was 0,999 and the reliability was 0,9995. The sensitivity and specificity of the test for scapular dyskinesis diagnosis were 72,73 and 90,91, respectively. Conclusions: SPA test is an objective method, precise and reliable to assess the position and rotation scapula. It presents criteria with highly sensitivity and specificity for scapular dyskinesis diagnosis.

AB  - The shoulder complex is prone to numerous pathologies and instabilities due to its large range of motion. The extent of injury is assessed through a series of observations and physical examinations. It is hypothesized that objective kinematic analysis of the shoulder could yield useful functional insights to aid clinical practice. Non-invasive motion analysis techniques to monitor shoulder function have been developed using passive markers; however, accurate measurement of scapula kinematics is problematic because of overlying tissue. The scapula locator is the accepted standard by which alternative non-invasive techniques of scapula tracking are validated. In this study, the viability of using skin-mounted markers to measure dynamic scapula movement is determined. Complete kinematic descriptions of ten healthy shoulders were obtained. Elevations of the glenohumeral joint were similar with both techniques, indicating that the skin marker method is suitable for gathering functional glenohumeral data. The main differences of note are seen at the scapulothoracic articulation where the skin marker method underestimated lateral rotation by more than 50 degrees at maximum elevation. However, the correlation between the two approaches is greater than 0.7, suggesting that it may be possible to derive linear regression models to predict dynamic scapulothoracic lateral rotation accurately using skin-mounted scapula markers.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to (1) assess the inter-rater reliability and validity of 2 clinical assessment methods of categorizing scapular dyskinesis and (2) quantify the frequency of asymmetry of bilateral scapular motion in injured and uninjured shoulders by use of 3-dimensional (3D) kinematic analysis. METHODS: We evaluated 56 subjects, 35 with shoulder injury and 21 with no symptoms. Two blinded evaluators categorized the scapular motion of all subjects to determine inter-rater reliability using 2 observational methods ("yes/no" and "4 type") to evaluate scapular dyskinesis. Subjects were also instrumented with electromagnetic receivers to assess bilateral 3D scapular kinematics to determine the presence of dyskinesis and establish criterion validity of the 2 methods. RESULTS: The inter-rater percent agreement and the degree of this agreement as measured by kappa statistic showed that the yes/no method produced a higher inter-rater percent agreement (79%, kappa = 0.40) than the 4-type method (61%, kappa = 0.44). The yes/no method had a higher sensitivity (76%) and positive predictive value (74%) when compared with the 3D criterion. A chi(2) analysis found significantly more multiple-plane asymmetries in symptomatic subjects (54%) in flexion compared with asymptomatic subjects (14%) (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: The yes/no method allows multiple-plane asymmetries to be considered in clinical assessment and therefore renders this a good screening tool for the presence of scapular dyskinesis. Kinematic analysis shows that asymmetries are common in symptomatic and asymptomatic populations. Testing in flexion showed a higher frequency of multiple-plane scapular asymmetries in the symptomatic group. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Identification of scapular dyskinesis is a key component of the shoulder examination. The clinician's ability to establish the presence or absence of scapular dyskinesis by observation is enhanced using a simple yes/no method especially when testing subjects in shoulder forward flexion. Although scapular asymmetries appear to be a prevalent finding, dyskinesis in the presence of shoulder symptoms should be considered a potential factor contributing to the dysfunction in the presence of shoulder symptoms should be considered a potential factor contributing to the dysfunction.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Impingement syndrome is probably the most common cause of shoulder pain. Abnormal abduction and proximal humeral translation are associated with this condition. We evaluated whether the relative distribution between glenohumeral and scapular-trunk motions (the scapulohumeral rhythm) and the speed of motion of the arm differed between patients with impingement and a control group without shoulder symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 30 patients with shoulder impingement (Neer stage 2) and 11 controls were studied during active abduction and 21 patients and 9 controls were studied during passive abduction. Dynamic RSA at a speed of 2 simultaneous exposures per second was used to record the shoulder motions for 5-6 seconds. RESULTS: Within the interval statistically evaluated (observations between 20-55 degrees of relative active abduction in the glenohumeral joint), the patient group showed more scapular and trunk motions (p = 0.04), especially at up to 40 degrees. The pattern of motion at passive abduction was somewhat similar to that in the controls. Both controls and patients showed an increasing absolute (i.e. global) proximal displacement of the center of the humeral head with increasing active and passive abduction of the glenohumeral joint and humerus, without any certain difference between the groups. The mean maximum absolute proximal displacement in the patient and control groups amounted to about 30 mm and 20 mm, respectively. The corresponding relative displacement (with fixed scapula) was only 2.0 and 0.5 mm. Active abduction was initiated with angular velocity of about 50 and 80 degrees per second, respectively, in the patients and the controls. In both groups it decreased with progressing abduction down to about 20 degrees per second (controls) after 3 seconds without there being any statistically significant difference. The angular velocities at passive abduction showed a similar pattern, still without any difference. In both groups, the speed of proximal translation during active abduction peaked 0.5-1 second later than the speed of rotation and remained relatively even for about 1 second, followed by a deceleration. INTERPRETATION: We found that the glenohumeral-thoracoscapular ratio during abduction of the arm in our study, measured as the distribution of motion between the glenohumeral joint and the trunk in both controls and patients with impingement, was less than or equal to 1:1. This finding differs from earlier results, probably due to the use of a method with high resolution and small influence of motions out of the frontal plane. The reason for reduced glenohumeral motions in the early phase of active abduction in the patient group is uncertain, but pain or avoidance of pain elicited by the motion was probably of importance.

AB  - A escápula possui funções essenciais no ombro do atleta de arremesso. Qualquer desequilíbrio presente entre as estruturas responsáveis pela sua estabilidade originará uma condição denominada discinesia escapular, a qual é comumente acompanhada de dor no ombro. Este estudo tem o objetivo de verificar se há associação entre a discinesia escapular e a dor no ombro de praticantes de natação. Foi realizado um estudo analítico observacional de corte transversal, incluindo 36 praticantes de natação do sexo masculino, com idade de 18 a 36 anos. Como métodos diagnósticos sugestivos de discinesia escapular foram utilizados o Slide Lateral Scapular Test e a filmagem proposta por Kibler. A existência de proporções significativas entre as variáveis nominais foi comprovada pelo teste do qui-quadrado ou pelo teste exato de Fisher. Para identificar associações entre as variáveis contínuas e os grupos de estudo foi utilizado o teste t de Student. Um p < 0,05 foi considerado estatisticamente significante. O grau de concordância interexaminador (Kappa; p < 0,0001) foi considerado substancial, correspondendo a 86,1 por cento (0,7656) no ombro direito e 83,3 por cento (0,6412) no esquerdo. Constatou-se que a grande maioria (80 por cento) dos indivíduos que apresentaram positividade no Slide Lateral Scapular Test relatou dor no ombro. Dentre os nadadores que apresentaram discinesia escapular durante a filmagem, em 70,8 por cento também foi constatada a presença dessa condição no teste estático. Este é um estudo original no que diz respeito à abordagem da discinesia escapular em nadadores e em relacioná-la com a presença de dor no ombro. Porém, a hipótese inicial de que haveria uma associação significante não foi correspondida.
AB  - The scapula plays an essential role in the throwing motion performed by athletes. Scapular dyskinesia is a condition characterized by imbalance in the structures responsible for the joint stability, which is often accompanied by shoulder pain. The main objective of this study is to assess the relationship between scapular dyskinesia and shoulder pain in swimmers. A total of 36 male swimmers aged between 18 and 36 years were diagnosed for scapular dyskinesia utilizing two different methods: the Lateral Slide Scapular Test and the video recording method suggested by Kibler. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Comparisons between groups were performed using the t-test. The degree of p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Significance was set at á=0.05. There was a high inter-rate reliability concerning the video analysis (Kappa; p<0.0001), corresponding to 86.1 percent (0.7656) on the right shoulder and 83.3 percent (0.6412) on the left shoulder. The majority of the individuals that had positive diagnosis assessed by the Lateral Slide Scapular Test (80 percent) reported pain on the shoulder. Furthermore, 70.8 percent of the subjects who had positive diagnosis by the video recording also had positive diagnosis in the static test. Although a significant association between scapular dyskinesia and shoulder pain was not found, this is an important study to approach these conditions in swimmers.

AB  - CONTEXT: The reliability of the measurement of the distance between the posterior border of the acromion and the wall and the reliability of the modified lateral scapular slide test have not been studied. Overall, the reliability of the clinical tools used to assess scapular positioning has not been studied in musicians. OBJECTIVE: To examine the intertester reliability of scapular observation and 2 clinical tests for the assessment of scapular positioning in musicians. DESIGN: Intertester reliability study. SETTING: University research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Thirty healthy student musicians at a single university. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Two assessors performed a standardized observation protocol, the measurement of the distance between the posterior border of the acromion and the wall, and the modified lateral scapular slide test. Each assessor was blinded to the other's findings. RESULTS: The intertester reliability coefficients (kappa) for the observation in relaxed position, during unloaded movement, and during loaded movement were 0.41, 0.63, and 0.36, respectively. The kappa values for the observation of tilting and winging at rest were 0.48 and 0.42, respectively; during unloaded movement, the kappa values were 0.52 and 0.78, respectively; and with a 1-kg load, the kappa values were 0.24 and 0.50, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the measurement of the acromial distance was 0.72 in relaxed position and 0.75 with the participant actively retracting both shoulders. The ICCs for the modified lateral scapular slide test varied between 0.63 and 0.58. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that the modified lateral scapular slide test was not a reliable tool to assess scapular positioning in these participants. Our data indicated that scapular observation in the relaxed position and during unloaded abduction in the frontal plane was a reliable assessment tool. The reliability of the measurement of the distance between the posterior border of the acromion and the wall in healthy musicians was moderate.

AB  - In a prospective study between 2000 and 2005, 22 patients with primary osteoarthritis of the shoulder had a total shoulder arthroplasty with a standard five-pegged glenoid component, 12 with non-offset humeral head and ten with offset humeral head components. Over a period of 24 months the relative movement of the glenoid component with respect to the scapula was measured using radiostereometric analysis. Nine glenoids needed reaming for erosion. There was a significant increase in rotation about all three axes with time (p < 0.001), the largest occurring about the longitudinal axis (anteversion-retroversion), with mean values of 3.8 degrees and 1.9 degrees for the non-offset and offset humeral head eroded subgroups, respectively. There was also a significant difference in rotation about the anteversion-retroversion axis (p = 0.01) and the varus-valgus (p < 0.001) z-axis between the two groups. The offset humeral head group reached a plateau at early follow-up with rotation about the z-axis, whereas the mean of the non-offset humeral head group at 24 months was three times greater than that of the offset group accounting for the highly significant difference between them.

AB  - Digitizing bony landmarks is a common technique used to measure scapular position, but it has not been validated against a gold standard. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of this technique for four physiological arm movements using optoelectronic markers mounted on scapular bone pins as a gold standard. Eight subjects had bone pins inserted into their lateral scapular spine. Three points were digitized on the scapula with an optoelectronic probe: the medial root of the scapular spine, the posterolateral corner of the acromion, and the inferior angle of the scapula. The four active movements tested in this study were glenohumeral abduction, glenohumeral horizontal adduction, hand behind back, and forward reaching. The three bony landmarks were digitized six times in three different positions for each movement. Data from one subject were rejected secondary to pin loosening. The overall position-specific r.m.s. errors ranged from 2.0 degrees to 12.5 degrees. The full abduction position had considerably higher r.m.s. errors than the other positions (posterior tipping, 12.5 degrees; upward rotation, 7.3 degrees; internal rotation, 12.0 degrees). It appears that the digitization of bony landmarks may be a valid method for measuring changes in scapular attitude with the following caveats: the full abduction position has a high r.m.s. error, and small scapular motions have high percentage errors.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Assessment of whether elevation and lowering of the dominant and nondominant arms occur in a similar manner in healthy individuals is clinically important in terms of shoulder disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) and performed electromyography (EMG) for the middle deltoid, upper trapezius, lower trapezius, and lower part of the serratus anterior muscles of both shoulders in 18 healthy volunteers (14 men, 4 women) with a mean age of 24 years (range, 19-30 years). The participants randomly elevated and lowered either the right or left arm in the scapular plane, and the motion was measured using a 3-dimensional motion analyzer. RESULTS: The average angles of maximum arm elevation and scapular upward rotation were 130.3 degrees +/- 7.9 degrees and 32.2 degrees +/- 5.6 degrees, respectively, for dominant arms, and 130.8 degrees +/- 6.4 degrees and 31.8 degrees +/- 5.8 degrees, respectively, for nondominant arms. The SHR in each 10 degrees increment did not differ significantly between the dominant and nondominant arms in each participant during elevation (P = .337) and lowering (P = .1). A significant difference was found in the percentage integrated EMG (%IEMG) of the lower trapezius between the 2 shoulders (P < .049). DISCUSSION: If the kinematic difference is identified between both shoulders, we can predict the dysfunction or disorder in shoulder complex. Moreover, we should evaluate how shoulder muscles are used and whether the muscle becomes weak. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy individuals elevate and lower the dominant and nondominant shoulders in a similar kinematical pattern despite 3 of 4 muscles indicating different EMG activities between both shoulders.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: The impingement mechanisms of the Neer and Hawkins sign remain unclear. In addition, there is still a lack of agreement regarding the arm rotation when performing the Neer sign. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight fresh frozen cadaveric shoulders were investigated. The specimens were attached to a shoulder-positioning device to which a compression force was applied. Subacromial contact pressure was measured with a flexible force sensor. The Neer sign was performed in three arm rotations (neutral, internal, and external). RESULTS: The contact sites of the coracoacromial arch side were common in both signs; however, those of the humeral head side were anatomically different: the supraspinatus tendon in the Neer sign and the subscapularis tendon in the Hawkins sign. The mean contact pressure in the Neer sign performed with the arm in internal rotation was greater than that in the Neer sign with the arm in other rotations. DISCUSSION: The data from this study indicate that the Neer and Hawkins signs do not represent the same impingement mechanism. The contact sites on the humeral head side were anatomically different. Additionally, it was found that the maximum contact pressure for the Neer sign is with internal rotation of the arm. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Basic Science Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty is a treatment option for cuff tear arthropathy. Scapular notching remains a concern. This biomechanical study compared the range-of-motion in different designs of glenospheres and hence the relative risk of scapular notching. METHOD: A precision coordinate device was used to investigate four different designs of glenospheres (SMR prosthesis); 36 mm concentric (Standard), 36 mm eccentric, 44 mm concentric, and 44 mm eccentric glenospheres. The centre of rotation in each design was first established. The position of the humeral prosthesis was recorded in the plane of the scapula to compare the degree of adduction and the total range-of-motion. RESULTS: Eccentric glenospheres were found to improve range-of-motion by allowing a higher degree of adduction. Larger diameter glenospheres were found to improve range-of-motion by increasing adduction and abduction. Compared to the 36 mm concentric (standard) glenosphere, the 36 mm eccentric glenosphere improved adduction by 14.5 degrees, the 44 mm concentric glenosphere improved adduction by 11.6 degrees, the 44 mm eccentric glenosphere improved adduction by 17.7 degrees. CONCLUSION: Eccentric glenospheres with a center-of-rotation placed more inferiorly were shown to improve adduction. This design may reduce the clinical incidence of scapular notching.

AB  - CONTEXT: Shoulder injuries are common in athletes involved in overhead sports, and scapular dyskinesis is believed to be one causative factor in these injuries. Many authors assert that abnormal scapular motion, so-called dyskinesis, is related to shoulder injury, but evidence from 3-dimensional measurement studies regarding this relationship is mixed. Reliable and valid clinical methods for detecting scapular dyskinesis are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To determine the interrater reliability of a new test designed to detect abnormal scapular motion. DESIGN: Correlation design using ratings from multiple pairs of testers. SETTING: University athletic training facilities. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 142 athletes (from National Collegiate Athletic Association Divisions I and III) participating in sports requiring intense overhead arm use. INTERVENTION(S): Participants were videotaped from the posterior aspect while performing 5 repetitions of bilateral, weighted (1.4-kg [3-lb] or 2.3-kg [5-lb]) shoulder flexion and frontal-plane abduction. Videotapes from randomly chosen participants were subsequently viewed and independently rated for the presence of scapular dyskinesis by 6 raters (3 pairs), with each pair rating 30 different participants. Raters were trained to detect scapular dyskinesis using a self-instructional format with standardized operational definitions and videotaped examples of normal and abnormal motion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Scapular dyskinesis was defined as the presence of either winging or dysrhythmia. Right and left sides were rated independently as normal, subtle, or obvious dyskinesis. We calculated percentage of agreement and weighted kappa (kappa(w)) coefficients to determine reliability. RESULTS: Percentage of agreement was between 75% and 82%, and kappa(w) ranged from 0.48 to 0.61. CONCLUSIONS: The test for scapular dyskinesis showed satisfactory reliability for clinical use in a sample of overhead athletes known to be at increased risk for shoulder symptoms.

AB  - CONTEXT: Although clinical methods for detecting scapular dyskinesis have been described, evidence supporting the validity of these methods is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To determine the validity of the scapular dyskinesis test, a visually based method of identifying abnormal scapular motion. A secondary purpose was to explore the relationship between scapular dyskinesis and shoulder symptoms. DESIGN: Validation study comparing 3-dimensional measures of scapular motion among participants clinically judged as having either normal motion or scapular dyskinesis. SETTING: University athletic training facilities. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 142 collegiate athletes (National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I and Division III) participating in sports requiring overhead use of the arm was rated, and 66 of these underwent 3-dimensional testing. INTERVENTION(S): Volunteers were viewed by 2 raters while performing weighted shoulder flexion and abduction. The right and left sides were rated independently as normal, subtle dyskinesis, or obvious dyskinesis using the scapular dyskinesis test. Symptoms were assessed using the Penn Shoulder Score. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Athletes judged as having either normal motion or obvious dyskinesis underwent 3-dimensional electromagnetic kinematic testing while performing the same movements. The kinematic data from both groups were compared via multifactor analysis of variance with post hoc testing using the least significant difference procedure. The relationship between symptoms and scapular dyskinesis was evaluated by odds ratios. RESULTS: Differences were found between the normal and obvious dyskinesis groups. Participants with obvious dyskinesis showed less scapular upward rotation (P < .001), less clavicular elevation (P < .001), and greater clavicular protraction (P = .044). The presence of shoulder symptoms was not different between the normal and obvious dyskinesis volunteers (odds ratio = 0.79, 95% confidence interval = 0.33, 1.89). CONCLUSIONS: Shoulders visually judged as having dyskinesis showed distinct alterations in 3-dimensional scapular motion. However, the presence of scapular dyskinesis was not related to shoulder symptoms in athletes engaged in overhead sports.

AB  - CONTEXT: The body of knowledge concerning shoulder kinematics in patients with rotator cuff tears is increasing. However, the level of understanding regarding how pain and tear size affect these kinematic patterns is minimal. OBJECTIVE: To identify relationships between pain associated with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear, tear size, and scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) and to determine whether pain and tear size serve as predictors of SHR. DESIGN: A test-retest design was used to quantify pain and SHR before and after a subacromial lidocaine injection. Correlation and multivariate analyses were used to identify relationships among pain, tear size, and SHR. SETTING: Orthopaedic biomechanics research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen patients (age range, 40-75 years) with diagnosed full-thickness rotator cuff tears participated. They were experiencing pain at the time of testing. INTERVENTION(S): Shoulder kinematic data were collected with an electromagnetic tracking system before and after the patient received a lidocaine injection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Pain was rated using a visual analog scale. Three-dimensional scapular kinematics and glenohumeral elevation were assessed. Scapular kinematics included anterior-posterior tilt, medial-lateral tilt, and upward-downward rotation. A regression model was used to calculate SHR (scapular kinematics to glenohumeral elevation) for phases of humeral elevation and lowering. RESULTS: Linear relationships were identified between initial pain scores and SHR and between tear size and SHR, representing an increased reliance on scapular motion with increasing pain and tear size. Pain was identified as an independent predictor of SHR, whereas significant findings for the effect of tear size on SHR and the interaction between pain and tear size were limited. CONCLUSIONS: We noted an increased reliance on scapular contributions to overall humeral elevation with increasing levels of pain and rotator cuff tear size. Pain associated with a rotator cuff tear serves as a primary contributor to the kinematic patterns exhibited in patients with rotator cuff tears.

AB  - The objective of the study was to compare the precision of shoulder anatomical landmark palpation using a CAST-like method and a newly developed anatomical palpator device (called A-Palp) using the forefinger pulp directly. The repeated-measures experimental design included four examiners that twice repeated measurements on eleven scapula and humerus anatomical landmarks during two sessions. Inter-session and inter-examiner precision was determined on volunteers. A-Palp accuracy was obtained from in vitro measurements and using virtual palpation on 3D bone models. Error propagation on the motion representation was also analyzed for a continuous motion of abduction movement performed in the shoulder joint. Palpation results showed that CAST and A-Palp methods lead to similar precision with the Maximal A-Palp calibration error being 1.5mm. In vivo precision of the CAST and A-Palp methods varied between 4mm (inter-session) and 8mm (inter-examiner). Mean propagation of the palpation error on the motion graph representation was 2 degrees and 5 degrees for scapula and humerus, respectively. A-Palp accuracy was 3.6 and 8.1mm for scapula and humerus, respectively. The A-Palp seems promising and could probably become an additional method next to today's marker-based motion analysis systems (i.e., Helen-Hayes configuration, CAST method).

AB  - Accurate spatial location of joint center (JC) is a key issue in motion analysis since JC locations are used to define standardized anatomical frames, in which results are represented. Accurate and reproducible JC location is important for data comparison and data exchange. This paper presents a method for JC locations based on the multiple regression algorithms without preliminary assumption on the behavior of the joint-of-interest. Regression equations were obtained from manually palpable ALs on each bone-of-interest. Results are presented for all joint surfaces found on the clavicle, scapula and humeral bone. Mean accuracy errors on the JC locations obtained on dry bones were 5.2+/-2.5 mm for the humeral head, 2.5+/-1.1 mm for the humeral trochlea, 2.3+/-0.9 mm for the humeral capitulum, 8.2+/-3.9 mm for the scapula glenoid cavity, 7.2+/-3.2 mm for the scapular aspect of the acromio-clavicular joint, 3.5+/-1.8mm for the clavicular aspect of the sternoclavicular joint and 3.2+/-1.4 mm for the clavicular aspect of the acromio-clavicular joint. In-vitro and in-vivo validation accuracy was 5.3 and 8.5mm, respectively, for the humeral head center location. Regression coefficients for joint radius dimension and joint surface orientation were also processed and reported in this paper.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The loss of glenohumeral internal rotation range of motion in overhead athletes has been well documented in the literature. Several different methods of assessing this measurement have been described, making comparison between the results of studies difficult. HYPOTHESIS: Significant differences in the amount of internal rotation range of motion exist when using different methods of stabilization. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: THREE TECHNIQUES WERE USED BILATERALLY IN RANDOM FASHION TO MEASURE GLENOHUMERAL INTERNAL ROTATION RANGE OF MOTION: stabilization of the humeral head, stabilization of the scapula, and visual inspection without stabilization. An initial study on 20 asymptomatic participants was performed to determine the intrarater and interrater reliability for each measurement technique. Once complete, measurements were performed on 39 asymptomatic professional baseball players to determine if a difference existed in measurement techniques and if there was a significant side-to-side difference. A 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used. RESULTS: While interrater reliability was fair between all 3 methods, scapular stabilization provided the best intrarater reliability. A statistically significant difference was observed between all 3 methods (P < .001). Internal rotation was significantly less in the dominant shoulder than in the nondominant shoulder (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Differences in internal rotation range of motion measurements exist when using different methods. The scapula stabilization method displayed the highest intrarater reproducibility and should be considered when evaluating internal rotation passive range of motion of the glenohumeral joint. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A standardized method of measuring internal rotation range of motion is required to accurately compare physical examinations of patients. The authors recommend the use of the scapula stabilization method to assess internal rotation range of motion by allowing normal glenohumeral arthrokinematics while stabilizing the scapulothoracic articulation.

AB  - CONTEXT: Scapular strength deficits have been linked to shoulder dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: To establish normative data on the scapulothoracic musculature in normal subjects using a handheld dynamometer. DESIGN: Descriptive normative data study. SETTING: Field research. SUBJECTS: 172 subjects with varying levels of overhead activity. METHODS: A handheld dynamometer was used to test the upper, middle, and lower trapezius; rhomboids; and serratus anterior. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A 2-factor ANOVA was performed for each of the muscles by activity level and unilateral ratio by activity-level analyses. Post hoc analysis included multiple pairwise comparisons, using the Dunn-Bonferroni correction method. RESULTS: Activity level did not significantly affect the unilateral ratios: Elevation:depression was 2.5:1, upward:downward rotation was 1.5:1, and protraction:retraction was 1.25:1. A rank order from strongest to weakest was established through significant comparisons. CONCLUSION: The unilateral ratios along with the rank order should be considered when discussing scapular rehabilitation protocols.

AB  - Noninvasive measurement of scapular kinematics using skin surface markers presents technical challenges due to the relative movement between the scapula and the overlying skin. The objectives of this study were to develop a noninvasive subject-specific skin correction factor that would enable a more accurate measurement of scapular kinematics and evaluate this new technique via comparison with a gold standard for scapular movement. Scapular kinematics were directly measured using bone pins instrumented with optoelectronic marker carriers in eight healthy volunteers while skin motion was measured simultaneously with optoelectronic markers attached to the skin surface overlying the scapula. The relative motion between the skin markers and the underlying scapula was estimated over a range of humeral orientations by palpating and digitizing bony landmarks on the scapula and then used to calculate correction factors that were weighted by humeral orientation. The scapular kinematics using these correction factors were compared with the kinematics measured via the bone pins during four arm movements in the volunteers: abduction, forward reaching, hand behind back, and horizontal adduction. The root-mean-square (rms) errors for the kinematics determined from skin markers without the skin correction factors ranged from 5.1 deg to 9.5 deg while the rms errors with the skin correction factors ranged from 1.4 deg to 3.0 deg. This technique appeared to perform well for different movements and could possibly be extended to other applications.

AB  - The object of this study was to assess interobserver reliability in 23 tests concerning physical examination of the shoulder girdle. A physical therapist and a physical therapist/manual therapist independently performed a physical examination of the shoulder girdle in 91 patients with shoulder complaints of varying severity and duration. The observers assessed 23 items in total: active and passive abductions, passive external rotation, hand in neck (HIN) test, hand in back (HIB) test, impingement test according to Neer, springing test of the first rib and joint play test of the acromioclavicular joint. The interobserver reliability was evaluated by means of a Cohen's Kappa, the weighted Kappa and the intraclass correlation (ICC). Criteria for acceptable reliability were: Kappa value>or=0.60, ICC>or=0.75 or an absolute agreement>or=80%. The results showed that Kappa values varied from 0.09 (springing test first rib, stiffness) to 0.66 (springing test first rib, pain), weighted Kappa varied from 0.35 (pain during HIB) to 0.73 (range of motion HIB) and ICC varied from 0.54 (abduction passive starting point painful arc) to 0.96 (active and passive ranges of motion in abduction). In total 11 (48%) items fulfilled the criteria of acceptable reliability. In conclusion, there appears to be a great deal of variation in the reliability of the tests used in the physical examination of the shoulder girdle. Over 50% of the tests did not meet the statistical criteria for acceptable reliability.

AB  - Shoulder pain is a diagnostic challenge and the physical clinical examination of the shoulder is crucial. It is important that the diagnostic tests used are valid as well as reliable. The objective of the study was to assess intra- and interexaminer reliability for four manual shoulder maneuvers; the Neer impingement sign, the Hawkins-Kennedy impingement test, the Patte maneuver, the Jobe supraspinatus test. These maneuvers are frequently used in clinical practice to examine patients with shoulder complaints in which subacromial pain is highly suspected. Thirty-three participants with shoulder pain were included consecutively. Within a week from inclusion, the four maneuvers were performed by a physiotherapist. The procedure was standardized in order to increase reproducibility. After a week, the maneuvers were performed again by the same physical therapist (test-retest) and by another physical therapist (test for interexaminer reliability). All four maneuvers have an almost perfect agreement (Kappa coefficients 0.91-1.00), if performed with suggested standardizations. Neer impingement sign, Hawkins-Kennedy impingement test, Patte maneuver as well as Jobe supraspinatus test, are highly reproducible and therefore reliable to use in clinical practice to identify patients with subacromial pain with an impingement phenomenon, but the maneuvers are limited as structural discriminators.

AB  - Measurement of anterior/posterior shoulder tightness, humeral external/internal rotation range of motion (ROM), scapular upward rotation/tipping ROM, and functional limitations were made in 46 patients with unilateral stiff shoulders (SSs) using a clinical measurement (shoulder tightness), a three-dimensional electromagnetic tracking device (shoulder ROM), and self-reports of function. Patients with SSs in their dominant shoulder demonstrated statistically greater posterior shoulder tightness compared to nondominant shoulder. Control dominant shoulders demonstrated decreased internal ROM as compared with control nondominant shoulders (p=0.021). In SSs, significant relationships were found between humeral internal rotation ROM and posterior shoulder tightness (R=0.49, p<0.0005), humeral external rotation ROM and anterior shoulder tightness (R=0.59, p=0.0002), scapular tipping and anterior shoulder tightness (R=0.57, p=0.004). Specifically, in patients with dominant SSs, posterior shoulder tightness and functional limitation were related (R=0.56, p=0.002). In patients with dominant involved shoulders, emphasise on posterior tightness stretch may improve functional ability directly. In addition to stretching program in patients with SSs, internal rotation ROM of control dominant shoulder is also important to consider in the rehabilitation of patients with SSs.

AB  - Exercises to retrain the orientation of the scapula are often used by physiotherapists to optimise shoulder girdle function. The movements and muscle activity required to assume this position have not yet been quantified. Further, patients often find this a difficult exercise to learn accurately, with no data being available on the accuracy of repeated performance. The primary objective of this study was to quantify the movements occurring during a commonly used scapular orientation exercise. The secondary objective was to describe the ability of subjects to learn this position after a brief period of instruction. A group of normal subjects (13 subjects; mean age 32, SD=9) were taught the scapular orientation exercise. Measurement of the position and muscle actions were made with a motion analysis system and surface electromyography. Further comparison was made of the accuracy of repeated trials. The most consistent movements were upward (mean=4 degrees, SEM=0.9 degrees) and posterior rotation (mean=4 degrees, SEM=1.6 degrees). All parts of the trapezius muscle demonstrated significant activity in maintaining the position while latissimus dorsi did not. Repeated trials showed that subjects were able to accurately repeat the movement without guidance. The key movements of, and immediate efficacy of a teaching approach for, scapular orientation have been established.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mouth-breathing is a common clinical condition among school-age children and some studies have correlated this condition with quality of life and postural alterations. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the orientation and position of the scapula, thoracic spine and head posture among mouth-breathing (MB) children and nasal-breathing (NB) children. METHODS: Twenty-one male MB children and 21 male NB children between 8 and 12 years of age participated in the study. Data were obtained through a stereophotogrammetry system that uses passive markers over anatomical landmarks to capture the position of the segments. Internal rotation, upward rotation, anterior tilt, scapular elevation and abduction were measured bilaterally as well as thoracic kyphosis, forward head position and shoulder protrusion. RESULTS: The MB children showed increased scapular superior position in relation to the NB group. No statistically significant differences were found between groups regarding the angular and linear measurements of the scapula. To verify reliability, three measurements were taken for each variable in the study. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) showed results above 0.8 for all the variables except for the internal rotation angle (I-Rot), below 0.5, probably due to uncertainty in the palpation of the inferior angle of the scapula. Ninety-five percent of the NB children and 58% among the MB children had been breastfed, this difference was statistically significant. There were statistically significant differences between groups regarding the domains of the Autoquestionnaire Qualité de Vie Enfant Imagé (AUQEI) scale and body mass index, which was higher among the NB children. CONCLUSIONS: MB children increased scapular superior position in comparison to NB children due probably to the position of forward head, leading to an alteration in the positioning of the mandible. The absence of significantly difference in posture pattern between groups in the present study could attributed to height-weight development in this age, as the posture of children changes in order to adapt to new body proportions, regardless of health status. The results observed in this study demonstrate the importance of using reliable measurements in the postural assessment of MB and NB children helping physical therapists to focus their strategies during rehabilitation in more specific conditions.

AB  - Disorders of the shoulder complex can be accompanied by changes in the movement pattern of the scapula. However, scapular motion is difficult to measure. A possible non-invasive method for dynamic three-dimensional kinematic measurement of the human scapula is the use of a marker cluster placed on the flat part of the acromion. A small light-weight acromion marker cluster (AMC) is presented in this study. In order to assess validity, kinematics obtained with the AMC were compared to simultaneous scapula locator (SL) recordings in a series of postures. The test/retest variability of replacement of the AMC, was also assessed. Measurement errors appeared to be sensitive for the plane of movement, the degree of humerus elevation, and replacement of the AMC. The AMC generally under-estimated scapula motion, compared to the SL. Some significant differences were found between the two methods, although the absolute differences were small (maximum mean difference 8.4 degrees in extreme position). In humerus forward flexion and abduction the maximum mean differences were 6 degrees or lower. In conclusion, the AMC is a valid method of measuring scapular movement during arm elevation that could be used in shoulder pathologies. Placement and planes of movement should be carefully considered and elevation of the humerus should not exceed 100 degrees.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluations of functional outcomes of reverse shoulder arthroplasty have revealed variable improvements in the range of motion and high rates of scapular notching. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the impact of surgical factors (location of the glenosphere on the glenoid and tilt angle of the glenosphere on the glenoid) and implant-related factors (implant size, center-of-rotation offset, and humeral neck-shaft angle) on impingement-free abduction motion. METHODS: A computer model was developed to virtually simulate abduction/adduction motion and its dependence on five surgical and implant-related factors. Three conditions were tested for each factor, resulting in a total of 243 simulated combinations. The overall motion was determined from 0 degrees of abduction until maximum abduction, which would be limited by impingement of the humerosocket on the scapula. In those combinations in which 0 degrees of abduction could not be achieved, the adduction deficit was recorded. RESULTS: The largest average increase in the range of impingement-free abduction motion resulted from a more lateral center-of-rotation offset: the average increase was 31.9 degrees with a change in the center-of-rotation offset from 0 to 10 mm, and this change resulted in an increase in abduction motion in eighty of the eighty-one combinations. The position of the glenosphere on the glenoid was associated with the second largest average increase in abduction motion (28.1 degrees when the glenosphere position was changed from superior to inferior, with the change resulting in an increase in seventy-one of the eighty-one combinations). These factors were followed by glenosphere tilt, humeral neck-shaft angle, and prosthetic size in terms of their effects on abduction motion. The largest effect in terms of avoiding an adduction deficit was provided by a humeral neck-shaft angle of 130 degrees (the deficit was avoided in forty-nine of the eighty-one combinations in which this angle was used), followed by an inferior glenosphere position on the glenoid (deficit avoided in forty-one combinations), a 10-mm lateral offset of the center of rotation, inferior tilt of the glenosphere, and a 42-mm-diameter prosthetic size. CONCLUSIONS: An understanding of a hierarchy of prosthetic design and implantation factors may be important to maximize impingement-free abduction motion as well as to avoid inferior impingement.

PARTICIPANTS: Subjects (n=45) without symptoms (21 men, 24 women; age range, 23-56y) and 45 subjects (22 men, 23 women; age range, 19-84y) with shoulder symptoms (defined as pain in the C5-6 dermatome reproduced by shoulder movement and not reproduced with cervical movement). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) models 2,1 and 2,3, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and SE of measurements for 68% confidence and 2 SEs of measurement (for the 95% CI) for the bilateral angular measurements of scapular rotation and tilt, and the bilateral linear measurements of lateral scapular displacement (protraction) and vertical displacement (elevation). RESULTS: For subjects without symptoms, ICC(2,3) results ranged from .75 to .98. The 2 SE results for the angular movements ranged from 1.8 degrees to 2.4 degrees and from 0.4 to 1.0 cm for the direct linear measurements. Subjects with symptoms: ICC(2,3) results ranged from .61 to .98. The 2 SE results for the angular movements ranged from 1.4 degrees to 2 degrees and from 0.6 to 1 cm for the direct linear measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated-measure (ICC(2,3)) results were more reliable than single-measure (ICC(2,1)) results. Very good to excellent intraobserver reliability was demonstrated for the angular and linear measurements of interest in both shoulders of subjects with and without symptoms. The 2 SE results provide guidance about the error associated with the individual measurements and will assist the clinician determining whether a change in the static position of the scapula has occurred as a result of intervention or over time.

AB  - The aim of this study was to define a body-fixed coordinate frame for the scapula that minimises axes variability and is closely related to the clinical frame of reference. Medical images of 21 scapulae were used to quantify 14 different axes from identifiable landmarks. The plane of the blade of the scapula was defined. The orientations of the quantified axes were calculated. The angular relationships between axes were quantified and applied to grade the sensitivity of each axis to inter-scapular variations in the others. The volume of data required to define an axis was noted for its dependency on pathology and the three criteria were weighted according to relative importance. The two axes with the highest weighting were applied to define a body-fixed Cartesian coordinate frame for the scapula. A least square medio-lateral line through the centre of the spine root was the most optimal axis. The plane formed by the spine root line and a least square line through the centre of the lateral border ridge was the most optimal scapular plane. This body-fixed Cartesian coordinate frame is closely aligned to the cardinal planes in the anatomical position and thus is a clinically applicable, specimen invariant coordinate frame that can be used in patient-specific kinematics modelling.

AB  - Palpation of movement is a common clinical tool for assessment of movement in patients with musculoskeletal symptoms. The purpose of this study was to measure the accuracy of palpation of shoulder girdle translation during the medial rotation test (MRT) of the shoulder. The translation of the gleno-humeral and scapulo-thoracic joints was measured using both three-dimensional ultrasound and palpation in order to determine the accuracy of translation tracking during the MRT of the shoulder. Two movements of 11 normal subjects (mean age 24 (SD=4), range 19-47 years) were measured. The agreement between measures was good for scapulo-thoracic translation (r=0.83). Gleno-humeral translation was systematically under estimated (p=0.03) although moderate correlation was found (r=0.65). These results indicate that translation of the measured joints can be tracked by palpation and further tests of the efficacy of palpation tracking during musculoskeletal assessment may be warranted.

AB  - Proper scapular motion is crucial for normal shoulder mechanics. Scapular motion affects glenohumeral joint function during throwing, yet little is known about this dynamic activity. Asymptomatic subjects (10 male and 10 female), ages 21 to 45, were analyzed. Electromagnetic surface sensors on the sternum, acromion, and humerus were used to collect 3-D motion data during three trials of low-velocity throwing. Scapular angular position data were described or five predetermined events throughout the throw corresponding with classic descriptions of throwing phases, and trial-to-trial reliability was determined. ANOVA compared scapular angles across events. Subjects demonstrated good to excellent reliability between trials of the throw (ICC 0.74-0.98). The scapula demonstrated a pattern of external rotation, upward rotation (peak of approx. 40 degrees), and poster humeral horizontal abduction. During the arm acceleration phase, the scapula moved toward greater internal rotation and began anteriorly tilting. At maximum humeral internal rotation, the scapula ended in internal rotation (55 degrees), upward rotation (20 degrees), and anterior tilting (3 degrees). Significant differences in scapular position (p<0.05) were identified across the throwing motion. Scapular data identify events in the throwing motion in which throwers may be more susceptible to shoulder pathologies related to abnormal scapular kinematics.

AB  - A repeated-measures design was used to assess glenohumeral rhythm in 10 patients with shoulder impingement and 10 pain-free persons and to assess the effects of subacromial injection on glenohumeral rhythm within the impingement group. Scapular-plane anterior-to-posterior x-rays of the scapula and humerus were obtained at 5 angles of arm elevation (resting, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees). For the impingement group, x-rays were repeated after subacromial injection (10 mL of 1% lidocaine). No significant differences in glenohumeral rhythm were found between the impingement and control groups across all arm-elevation angles.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Two group, repeated measures design. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether manually repositioning the scapula using the Scapula Reposition Test (SRT) reduces pain and increases shoulder elevation strength in athletes with and without positive signs of shoulder impingement. BACKGROUND: Symptom alteration tests may be useful in determining a subset of those with shoulder pathology who may benefit from interventions aimed at improving scapular motion abnormalities. METHODS AND MEASURES: One hundred forty-two college athletes underwent testing for clinical signs of shoulder impingement. Tests provoking symptoms were repeated with the scapula manually repositioned into greater retraction and posterior tilt. A numeric rating scale was used to measure symptom intensity under both conditions. Isometric shoulder elevation strength was measured using a mounted dynamometer with the scapula in its natural position and with manual repositioning. A paired t test was used to compare the strength between positions. The frequency of a significant increase in strength with scapular repositioning, defined as the minimal detectable change (90% confidence interval), was also assessed. RESULTS: Of the 98 athletes with a positive impingement test, 46 had reduced pain with scapular repositioning. Although repositioning produced an increase in strength in both the impingement (P=.001) and non-impingement groups (P=.012), a significant increase in strength was found with repositioning in only 26% of athletes with, and 29% of athletes without positive signs for shoulder impingement. CONCLUSION: The SRT is a simple clinical test that may potentially be useful in an impairment based classification approach to shoulder problems.

AB  - Patients with rotator cuff tear arthropathy can be treated successfully with a reverse total shoulder prosthesis. In patients with significant glenoid bone loss, achieving stable bone fixation can be challenging, as the surgeon must know when bone grafting is necessary and when the plan to implant the reverse total shoulder prosthesis should be abandoned because of the likelihood of early implant loosening. The purposes of this study were (1) to determine the initial stability of a metal glenoid implant fixed in a glenoid with a central cavitary defect and (2) to determine whether an altered screw configuration would sufficiently resist implant micromotion and, thereby, allow bone ingrowth to occur. The Delta III reverse total shoulder glenoid implant was fixed into foam scapulae with a uniform density similar to normal glenoid bone density. The control group implants were fixed into foam scapulae without a glenoid defect, by use of the standard surgical technique for screw placement. The second group was fixed into foam scapulae containing a central cavitary glenoid defect, by use of the standard surgical technique for screw placement. The central cavitary defect was meant to simulate the bone loss typically found after the removal of a loose pegged glenoid implant, and it was created with a 4-pegged glenoid drill guide. A third group was fixed into foam scapula with a central cavitary glenoid defect, with an experimental screw configuration by use of a posterior screw directed toward the spine of the scapula and an anterior screw directed inferior to the central peg. All specimens were loaded with 500 cycles of 1 body weight (70 kg) to simulate the forces generated during arm elevation that occur during the first 3 months after surgery. Micromotion between the implant and the foam bone was measured with a digital video motion analysis system (accuracy, +/- 2.6 microm). After loading of the implant with 70 kg for 500 cycles in the superior direction, the mean micromotion was 54 microm (SD, 22) in the control group, 159 microm (SD, 70) in the second group, and 86 microm (SD, 32) in the third group (P = 0.003). Fixing the posterior screw into the spine of the scapula and directing the anterior screw below the central peg decreased the micromotion of a metal glenoid implant fixed in a glenoid with a cavitary defect by 46% and, more importantly, reduced the micromotion below the critical threshold of 150 microm, which is necessary for bone ingrowth and long-term survival of the implant.

AB  - Physical therapy is an intervention commonly used in the treatment of subjects with frozen shoulder symptoms, with limited proven effect. The purpose of this study was to identify the kinematic features of patients with frozen shoulder who are more likely to respond to physical therapy. Thirty-four subjects presenting frozen shoulder syndrome were studied to determine altered shoulder kinematics and functional disability. Subjects received the same standardized treatment with passive mobilization/stretching techniques, physical modalities (i.e. ultrasound, shortwave diathermy and/or electrotherapy) and active exercises twice a week for 3 months. Initially, subjects were asked to perform full active motion in 3 tests: abduction in the scapular plane, hand-to-neck and hand-to-scapula. During the test, shoulder kinematics were measured using a 3-D electromagnetic motion-capturing system. In the initial and follow-up sessions, the self-reported Flexilevel Scale of Shoulder Function (FLEX-SF) was used to determine functional disability from symptoms. Improvement with treatment was determined using percent change in FLEX-SF scores over three months of treatment [(final score-initial score)/initial score x 100, >20% improvement and < = 20% nonimprovement]. Shoulder kinematics were first analysed for univariate accuracy in predicting improvement and then combined into a multivariate prediction method. A prediction method with two variables (scapular tipping >8.4 degrees during arm elevation, and external rotation >38.9 degrees during hand to neck) were identified. The presence of these two variables (positive likelihood ratio=15.71) increased the probability of improvement with treatment from 41% to 92%. It appears that shoulder kinematics may predict improvement in subjects with frozen shoulder syndrome. Prospective validation of the proposed prediction method is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the coordination of humeral, scapular and thoracolumbar spine motions during a number of unilateral and bilateral upper limb movements in a range of movement conditions. METHODS: Thirty-two healthy women performed unilateral and bilateral arm elevations in three planes-sagittal, coronal and scapular. Scapular, humeral and spinal orientations were measured at 100 Hz using a multi-sensor, 6-degree-of-freedom electromagnetic tracking system. Segmental displacements were computed following International Society of Biomechanics recommendations. FINDINGS: Humeral, scapular and thoracic segments demonstrate consistent, synchronous interactions. Scapular upward rotation is significantly greater on the non-dominant side than the dominant in all planes of movement and in both unilateral and bilateral arm movement. Unilateral and bilateral arm movements produce significantly different ranges and patterns of spinal motion and ranges of scapular external rotation. There does not appear to be any effect of age, height or weight on the ranges or patterns of motion of the shoulder girdle and spine during arm elevation. INTERPRETATION: Movement of the arm into elevation, irrespective of the plane of motion, has significant implications for the shoulder girdle and the thoracic spine. Clinical assessment of the shoulder should include the thoracic spine.

AB  - Rotator cuff tears are a common injury that affect a significant percentage of the population over age 60. Although it is widely believed that the rotator cuff's primary function is to stabilize the humerus against the glenoid during shoulder motion, accurately measuring the three-dimensional (3D) motion of the shoulder's glenohumeral joint under in-vivo conditions has been a challenging endeavor. In particular, conventional motion measurement techniques have frequently been limited to static or two-dimensional (2D) analyses, and have suffered from limited or unknown in-vivo accuracy. We have recently developed and validated a new model-based tracking technique that is capable of accurately measuring the 3D position and orientation of the scapula and humerus from biplane X-ray images. Herein we demonstrate the in-vivo application of this technique for accurately measuring glenohumeral joint translations during shoulder motion in the repaired and contralateral shoulders of patients following rotator cuff repair. Five male subjects were tested at 3-4 months following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Superior-inferior humeral translation was measured during elevation, and anterior-posterior humeral translation was measured during external rotation in both the repaired and contralateral shoulders. The data failed to detect statistically significant differences between the repaired and contralateral shoulders in superior-inferior translation (p=0.74) or anterior-posterior translation (p=0.77). The measurement technique overcomes the limitations of conventional motion measurement techniques by providing accurate, 3D, in-vivo measures of glenohumeral joint motion during dynamic activities. On-going research is using this technique to assess the effects of conservative and surgical treatment of rotator cuff tears.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study is to determine if performing push up exercise variations on an unstable surface (Swiss ball) influences EMG amplitude of the scapulothoracic muscles when compared with a stable surface (Bench). METHODS: Ten males were recruited from a convenience sample of college students. Surface electromyograms were recorded from the upper trapezius, lower trapezius, serratus anterior and biceps brachii while performing push up exercises with the feet or hands placed on a bench and separately on a Swiss ball. A push up plus exercise was also evaluated with hands on the different support surfaces. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant (p<0.05) difference in mean EMG amplitude on a Swiss ball when compared with the same exercise performed on a bench. Significant differences in muscle activity were seen in the upper trapezius and serratus anterior as a result of changes in foot position relative to hand position irrespective of surface stability. INTERPRETATION: The unstable surface used in this study is not a sufficient condition to generate an increase in muscle activity in select scapulothoracic and glenohumeral muscles during push up exercise variations. Elevating the feet above the hands appeared to have a greater influence on shoulder stabilizing musculature amplitude than the addition of a Swiss ball.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the electromyographic activity in the shoulder girdle musculature during ipsilateral kinetic chain exercises performed in a shoulder immobilizer in asymptomatic men. DESIGN: Descriptive. SETTING: Motion analysis laboratory at a tertiary care center. PARTICIPANTS: Five asymptomatic male volunteers, ages 24 to 32 years. INTERVENTION: Fine-wire (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, upper subscapularis) and surface (deltoids, trapezii, biceps, serratus anterior) electrodes recorded electromyographic activity from each muscle during a split-stance cross-body rotation (twisting to the opposite side at high, mid, and low levels), split stance attempted ipsilateral floor touch, and attempted overhead reach. All movements were initiated from the immobilized scapula and were tested with and without a combined step. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mean peak normalized (percentage of maximum voluntary contraction [%MVC]) electromyographic activity of each muscle during each exercise. RESULTS: For all exercises, biceps and infraspinatus activity remained low (<10% MVC), whereas upper subscapularis activity was moderate to very high (29%-68% MVC). Supraspinatus activity was low (<20% MVC) for all motions except the attempted overhead reach (23% MVC). Serratus electromyographic activity was less than 20% of MVC for all motions and was most responsive to added stepping (23%-136% MVC without stepping vs 24%-199% MVC with stepping). Cross-body rotation at lower heights progressively increased serratus activity while decreasing supraspinatus, upper trapezius, and anterior deltoid activity. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these electromyographic data, selected kinetic chain exercises could potentially be implemented during periods of shoulder immobilization. All exercises examined could potentially be safe after superior labral anteroposterior repair, but not after subscapularis repair. All exercises, with the exception of the attempted overhead reach, could potentially be safe after supraspinatus repair, with or without concomitant infraspinatus repair. Early activation of the serratus anterior could potentially be achieved by performing cross-body rotations, particularly at lower heights.

AB  - Rotator cuff tears cause morphologic changes to cuff tendons and muscles, which can alter muscle architecture and moment arm. The effects of these alterations on shoulder mechanical performance in terms of muscle force and joint strength are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a three-dimensional explicit finite element model for investigating morphological changes to rotator cuff tendons following cuff tear. The subsequent objectives were to validate the model by comparing model-predicted moment arms to empirical data, and to use the model to investigate the hypothesis that rotator cuff muscle moment arms are reduced when tendons are divided along the force-bearing direction of the tendon. The model was constructed by extracting tendon, cartilage, and bone geometry from the male Visible Human data set. Infraspinatus and teres minor muscle and tendon paths were identified relative to the humerus and scapula. Kinetic and kinematic boundary conditions in the model replicated experimental protocols, which rotated the humerus from 45 degrees internal to 45 degrees external rotation with constant loads on the tendons. External rotation moment arms were calculated for two conditions of the cuff tendons: intact normal and divided tendon. Predicted moment arms were within the 1-99% confidence intervals of experimental data for nearly all joint angles and tendon sub-regions. In agreement with the experimental findings, when compared to the intact condition, predicted moment arms were reduced for the divided tendon condition. The results of this study provide evidence that one potential mechanism for the reduction in strength observed with cuff tear is reduction of muscle moment arms. The model provides a platform for future studies addressing mechanisms responsible for reduced muscle force and joint strength including changes to muscle length-tension operating range due to altered muscle and tendon excursions, and the effects of cuff tear size and location on moment arms and muscle forces.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormal scapular displacements during arm elevation have been observed in people with shoulder impingement syndrome. These abnormal scapular displacements were evaluated using different methods and instruments allowing a 3-dimensional representation of the scapular kinematics. The validity and the intrasession reliability have been shown for the majority of these methods for healthy people. However, the intersession reliability on healthy people and people with impaired shoulders is not well documented. This measurement property needs to be assessed before using such methods in longitudinal comparative studies. The objective of this study is to evaluate the intra and intersession reliability of 3-dimensional scapular attitudes measured at different arm positions in healthy people and to explore the same measurement properties in people with shoulder impingement syndrome using the Optotrak Probing System. METHODS: Three-dimensional scapular attitudes were measured twice (test and retest interspaced by one week) on fifteen healthy subjects (mean age 37.3 years) and eight subjects with subacromial shoulder impingement syndrome (mean age 46.1 years) in three arm positions (arm at rest, 70 degrees of humerothoracic flexion and 90 degrees of humerothoracic abduction) using the Optotrak Probing System. Two different methods of calculation of 3-dimensional scapular attitudes were used: relative to the position of the scapula at rest and relative to the trunk. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error of measure (SEM) were used to estimate intra and intersession reliability. RESULTS: For both groups, the reliability of the three-dimensional scapular attitudes for elevation positions was very good during the same session (ICCs from 0.84 to 0.99; SEM from 0.6 degrees to 1.9 degrees ) and good to very good between sessions (ICCs from 0.62 to 0.97; SEM from 1.2 degrees to 4.2 degrees ) when using the method of calculation relative to the trunk. Higher levels of intersession reliability were found for the method of calculation relative to the trunk in anterior-posterior tilting at 70 degrees of flexion compared to the method of calculation relative to the scapula at rest. CONCLUSION: The estimation of three-dimensional scapular attitudes using the method of calculation relative to the trunk is reproducible in the three arm positions evaluated and can be used to document the scapular behavior.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Replacement of the diseased shoulder joint with implants is a procedure whose frequency is rapidly increasing. However, glenoid replacement remains challenging due to the difficult joint exposure and visualization of anatomical reference landmarks during the procedure. Improper positioning of the glenoid component can lead to early failure. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a Computer Assisted Glenoid Implantation (CAGI) technique to achieve a more accurate and reliable placement of the glenoid component. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty cadaveric scapulae were imaged with CT. The accuracy of an electromagnetic tracking system and 3D surface modeling for the measurement of glenoid position was compared to that of the standard CT-based method. Custom jigs were then developed to track instruments and to correct for scapular motion during in vitro trials. A standardized protocol for determining, in real time, the glenoid position and placement was developed and validated. RESULTS: The version angles measured by the tracking system, CT, and the 3D modeling software were 0.0 +/- 1.2 degrees , -1.3 +/- 1.0 degrees , and -1.1 +/- 1.1 degrees , respectively. The magnitudes for inclination angles were 0.7 +/- 0.7 degrees , 0.9 +/- 0.8 degrees , and 1.0 +/- 0.7 degrees , respectively. A statistically significant difference was found only between measurements made with the tracking system and with CT (p < 0.05). Testing of the CAGI system in a cadaveric trial resulted in an accuracy of 1.17 degrees of version and 0.60 degrees of inclination. The procedure was readily performed with excellent feedback and guidance for the surgeon. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative planning using CT imaging with 3D modeling and intraoperative tracking were combined to produce improved accuracy and reliability of glenoid implantation in the setting of total shoulder arthroplasty.

AB  - The goal of this study was to measure 3-dimensional shoulder motion by use of a direct invasive technique during 4 different arm movements in healthy volunteers. Eight subjects with healthy shoulders were recruited. Optoelectronic marker carriers (ie, infrared light-emitting diodes) were mounted on bone pins, which were inserted into the lateral scapular spine. Subjects performed 4 different arm movements while the motion was being recorded by a precision optoelectronic camera. Joint angles were calculated in 3 dimensions. Intraclass correlation coefficients and root-mean-square differences were calculated as measures of reliability. During abduction, the scapula tipped posteriorly (44 degrees +/- 11 degrees), rotated upward (49 degrees +/- 7 degrees), and rotated externally (27 degrees +/- 11 degrees). For reaching, the scapula consistently rotated upward (17 degrees +/- 3 degrees) and rotated internally (18 degrees +/- 6 degrees) whereas tipping was generally less than 10 degrees (5 degrees +/- 2 degrees). Overall, the range of scapular movement for the hand behind the back was small and variable, with most rotations not exceeding 15 degrees. For horizontal adduction, the scapula tipped anteriorly (8 degrees +/- 3 degrees), rotated upward (5 degrees +/- 2 degrees), and rotated internally (27 degrees +/- 6 degrees). These scapular rotations provide normative data that will be useful for diagnosing scapular dysfunction.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Aberrations in shoulder movement patterns are believed to be associated with the presence of shoulder symptoms. However, the detection of movement aberrations has not been rigorously investigated. It is possible that manipulative physiotherapists use the clinical history to prejudge the existence of aberrations, rather than the actual observation of the movement pattern itself. There is a need to determine whether physiotherapists, in the absence of a clinical history, can relate observed anomalies of shoulder movement to the presence of symptoms and to determine the reliability for observation of such anomalous shoulder movement. METHODS: The sample comprised of 9 symptomatic subjects recruited from four physiotherapy clinics in Christchurch, New Zealand and a further 11 asymptomatic subjects recruited from Christchurch's general population. They were videotaped performing shoulder flexion, abduction, and scapular plane abduction. The video-recordings were evaluated by 11 manipulative physiotherapists who did not know which subjects were symptomatic and who were thus required to judge the symptomatic status as: asymptomatic, symptomatic left, symptomatic right or symptomatic both. Additionally, each physiotherapist completed a survey on each of the 20 subjects regarding the type of movement anomaly that was perceived (e.g. too much scapular elevation, too little glenohumeral movement, etc). Classification accuracy (percentage of correct responses) and agreement (kappa) among physiotherapists were computed. RESULTS: Out of the 220 responses by the physiotherapists regarding symptomatic status, 58% were correct, with 68% asymptomatic, 71% symptomatic left and 30% symptomatic right subjects correctly classified. Reliability analysis showed kappa statistics for all subjects was 0.23, for asymptomatic subjects 0.22, symptomatic left 0.34, and symptomatic right 0.17. Only five subjects had two or more evaluators agree on the type of anomalous movement. CONCLUSIONS: Although movement analysis is considered an integral part of a physiotherapist's skill this research has shown that a sample of experienced manipulative physiotherapists had difficulty in determining the symptomatic status of patients with clinically diagnosed shoulder complaints by movement analysis alone.

AB  - Non-invasive dynamical measurements of 3D scapular motion can be performed easily by attachment of a 6 DOF electromagnetic receiver onto the skin above the acromion. To quantify the introduction of possible errors due to skin displacement, we assessed 3D scapular positions on n=8 subjects by both tripod and skin-fixed method. Error analysis included the variables method (tripod, skin-fixed simultaneously with tripod, separate skin-fixed at 0 and 0.25Hz of elevation speed), plane of elevation (0 degrees and 90 degrees ) and observation (receiver replacement: n=3). Inter-individual 'group' differences depended on elevation plane and showed an average underestimation of scapular rotation of 6.5 degrees (worst case 13 degrees ) using the skin-fixed method. Only the group RMSE, not the individual RMSE, could be successfully lowered using linear regression (to about 2 degrees ). Inter-trial reliability (RMSE <3.24 degrees , ICC>0.94) and RMSE between 0 and 0.25Hz recordings (about 2.5 degrees ) were satisfactory. Intra-observer RMSE after replacement of the skin-fixed receiver was 5 degrees . The skin-fixed method is suitable for dynamic recordings of scapular rotations; however, measurements are precise only when the acromion receiver is not replaced. Combined with a relatively low accuracy, we conclude that the skin-fixed method should be used only in combination with tripod 'calibration'.

AB  - PURPOSE: To quantify acromial slope (the scapuloacromial [SA] angle). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used shoulder MR studies in 64 subjects who were stratified surgically into impingement (with and without tear) and nonimpingement (shoulder instability) groups. We measure, in three dimensions, the angle between unit normal vectors to planes of best fit to the undersurface of the acromion and the medial surface of the blade of the scapula. We examine the projection of this SA angle onto the transverse, coronal, and sagittal planes to gauge some measure of rotation, lateral tilt, and anterior tilt with respect to the patient. Orientation of the acromion and scapular blade in relation to the MR scanner and therefore to the patient was also calculated. RESULTS: We found no significant differences between these two groups when examining age and side of pathology. A statistically significant difference was seen between males and females. CONCLUSION: Our study does not support the idea that a flatter acromial slope causes impingement and is an etiological basis for rotator cuff tears. We believe that acromial slope, regardless of imaging plane, is not useful in classifying patients who present with shoulder pain and should not be considered as a source of pathologic changes.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Test-retest reliability study. OBJECTIVE: To determine interrater reliability of the modified scapular assistance test (SAT). The modified SAT is designed to assess the contribution of scapular motion to shoulder pain. BACKGROUND: Abnormal scapular motion has been implicated in different shoulder disorders. However, there is a lack of clinical evaluation tools to assess the scapular component of shoulder dysfunction. METHODS AND MEASURES: Forty-six subjects who were referred to physical therapy for treatment of various shoulder pathologies were recruited for this study. The modified SAT was performed on each participant by 2 different examiners. Percent agreement and kappa coefficient were utilized to determine interrater reliability of the modified SAT. RESULTS: The kappa coefficient and percent agreement were .53 and 77%, respectively, when the test was performed in the scapular plane, and .62 and 91%, respectively, when the test was performed in the sagittal plane. CONCLUSIONS: The modified SAT possesses acceptable interrater reliability for clinical use.

BACKGROUND: A battery of function-related tests has the potential to complement assessment of functional limitation in patients who have shoulder pathologies. METHODS AND MEASURES: Three function-related tests (hand to neck, hand to scapula, and hand to opposite scapula) were conducted on 46 patients with shoulder pathologies, and 46 age- and gender-matched control subjects. The tests were performed by 2 independent physiotherapists to test intertester reliability. Intratester reliability was examined by investigating the reproducibility of the tests performed twice, with 3 to 5 days between tests, by the same physiotherapist. Comparison of the scores on the function-related tests between patients and controls was evaluated. A correlation matrix was calculated to test the level of association among the tests. RESULTS: Intratester and intertester reliability on the 3 tests (weighted K) varied from 0.83 to 0.90. The patient's test performances were decreased in comparison to the control group. The correlation matrix demonstrated a level of associations among the 3 tests varying from r = 0.64 to r = 0.66. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that function-related tests are reliable and could be used in clinical practice to document reduced function of the shoulder. The level of association among the tests indicates that each test measured different aspects of shoulder function.

AB  - Shoulder motion is complex and significant research efforts have focused on measuring glenohumeral joint motion. Unfortunately, conventional motion measurement techniques are unable to measure glenohumeral joint kinematics during dynamic shoulder motion to clinically significant levels of accuracy. The purpose of this study was to validate the accuracy of a new model-based tracking technique for measuring three-dimensional, in vivo glenohumeral joint kinematics. We have developed a model-based tracking technique for accurately measuring in vivo joint motion from biplane radiographic images that tracks the position of bones based on their three-dimensional shape and texture. To validate this technique, we implanted tantalum beads into the humerus and scapula of both shoulders from three cadaver specimens and then recorded biplane radiographic images of the shoulder while manually moving each specimen's arm. The position of the humerus and scapula were measured using the model-based tracking system and with a previously validated dynamic radiostereometric analysis (RSA) technique. Accuracy was reported in terms of measurement bias, measurement precision, and overall dynamic accuracy by comparing the model-based tracking results to the dynamic RSA results. The model-based tracking technique produced results that were in excellent agreement with the RSA technique. Measurement bias ranged from -0.126 to 0.199 mm for the scapula and ranged from -0.022 to 0.079 mm for the humerus. Dynamic measurement precision was better than 0.130 mm for the scapula and 0.095 mm for the humerus. Overall dynamic accuracy indicated that rms errors in any one direction were less than 0.385 mm for the scapula and less than 0.374 mm for the humerus. These errors correspond to rotational inaccuracies of approximately 0.25 deg for the scapula and 0.47 deg for the humerus. This new model-based tracking approach represents a non-invasive technique for accurately measuring dynamic glenohumeral joint motion under in vivo conditions. The model-based technique achieves accuracy levels that far surpass all previously reported non-invasive techniques for measuring in vivo glenohumeral joint motion. This technique is supported by a rigorous validation study that provides a realistic simulation of in vivo conditions and we fully expect to achieve these levels of accuracy with in vivo human testing. Future research will use this technique to analyze shoulder motion under a variety of testing conditions and to investigate the effects of conservative and surgical treatment of rotator cuff tears on dynamic joint stability.

AB  - The repeatability of shoulder instability clinical examinations has been reported to be poor, producing a large range of translations. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of providing the clinician with joint orientation feedback on the magnitude and precision of glenohumeral joint kinematics. A 6-degree of freedom magnetic tracking system was used to determine the kinematics of the humerus with respect to the scapula (n=8 cadaveric shoulders). The joints were preconditioned with simple loading tests five times. At 60 degrees of glenohumeral abduction and 0 degrees of flexion/extension, a clinician then applied an anterior and posterior load to the humerus until a manual maximum simulating a simple translation test (STT) was achieved at 0, 30, and 60 degrees of external rotation with and without angular orientation feedback of the humerus with respect to the scapula. The precision for the external rotation was within 4.3 degrees for the feedback group and 17.5 degrees for the no feedback group over all external rotations. For achieving the target external rotation of 30 degrees , there was a significant difference in precision between the feedback and no feedback groups (p<0.05). The magnitudes of the anterior translations were 18.2+/-5.3, 15.5+/-5.1, and 9.9+/-5.5 mm for the feedback group and 19.3+/-6.6, 17.5+/-4.9, and 11.5+/-5.3 mm for the no feedback group, at 0, 30, and 60 degrees of external rotation, respectively. There was a significant difference in the precision of anterior translation at 30 and 60 degrees of external rotation for 4 of 8 specimens (p<0.05). Significant differences in the precision of the posterior translation was only detected at 0 degrees of external rotation for 3 of 8 specimens (p<0.05). Based on the data obtained, providing orientation feedback to a clinician performing a simulated STT results in increased precision for not only the target external rotations but also the resulting glenohumeral translations. While providing feedback may be a necessary step to achieving precise results for experimental studies, the magnitudes of translations in the anterior and posterior directions were relatively similar for the feedback and no feedback states indicating little benefit for clinical examinations.

AB  - CONTEXT: Using constant, variable, and absolute error to measure movement accuracy might provide a more complete description of joint position sense than any of these values alone. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of loaded movements and type of feedback on shoulder joint position sense and movement velocity. DESIGN: Applied study with repeated measures comparing type of feedback and the presence of a load. SETTING: Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Twenty healthy subjects (age = 27.2 +/- 3.3 years, height = 173.2 +/- 18.1 cm, mass = 70.8 +/- 14.5 kg) were seated with their arms in a custom shoulder wheel. INTERVENTION(S): Subjects internally rotated 27 degrees in the plane of the scapula, with either visual feedback provided by a video monitor or proprioceptive feedback provided by prior passive positioning, to a target at 48 degrees of external rotation. Subjects performed the internal rotation movements with video feedback and proprioceptive feedback and with and without load (5% of body weight). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): High-speed motion analysis recorded peak rotational velocity and accuracy. Constant, variable, and absolute error for joint position sense was calculated from the final position. RESULTS: Unloaded movements demonstrated significantly greater variable error than for loaded movements (2.0 +/- 0.7 degrees and 1.5 +/- 0.4 degrees, respectively) (P < .05), but there were no differences in constant or absolute error. Peak velocity was greater for movements with proprioceptive feedback (45.6 +/- 2.9 degrees/s) than visual feedback (39.1 +/- 2.1 degrees/s) and for unloaded (47.8 +/- 3.6 degrees/s) than loaded (36.9 +/- 1.0 degrees/s) movements (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Shoulder joint position sense demonstrated greater variable error unloaded versus loaded movements. Both visual feedback and additional loads decreased peak rotational velocity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with full thickness rotator cuff tears typically demonstrate an increase in scapular motion, both in the clinic and under controlled laboratory conditions. To better understand the mechanisms behind this pattern of motion, we propose a suprascapular nerve block as an appropriate model of dysfunction of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus, which are the two tendons most commonly affected in cuff tear patients. METHODS: Healthy subjects underwent testing for 3D scapular kinematics with a Polhemus magnetic tracking device and isometric force measurements during external rotation. A suprascapular nerve block was then performed with the injection of lidocaine into the suprascapular notch of each subject. Scapular kinematics and isometric force measurements were repeated after confirmation of the block. FINDINGS: The nerve block resulted in no significant changes in clavicular rotations and scapular posterior tilting. However, there was a significant increase in scapular external rotation and upward rotation. While kinematic changes returned to baseline within 25 min of the block, force measurements did not return to baseline until 75 min post-block. Interpretation. The results of this study, especially those for upward rotation, are in general agreement with what has been found for patients with rotator cuff tears. While the supraspinatus and infraspinatus do not directly control the movement of the scapula, they appear to result in a compensatory change in scapular motion. Although more work needs to be done, it appears that abnormal scapular motion patterns observed in patients with cuff tears may therefore be compensatory in nature.

AB  - Several methods have been developed recently for the analysis of the spatial motion of the scapula and the arm, whereby the spatial position of shoulder bones is determined in static conditions by interrupting motion. The authors have developed a 3D motion analysis method recording scapular motion in progress with appropriate accuracy in the course of arm movements of various degrees. The objective of this study is to explore the applicability of the method developed, as well as to compare it with and verify it by other methods developed earlier. The position and displacements of shoulder bones were determined on 30 shoulders of 15 healthy people. The newly developed measurement method is based on the mechanical basic principle stating that the position and motion of a rigid body -- in this case, the bones (segments) forming the shoulder joint -- can be calculated at any moment from the spatial coordinates of three points of a segment and any changes thereof in the course of motion. Ultrasound-based triplets providing the three points (fundamental points) by a segment as required for measurement were fixed on the sternum (modeling the trunk), the clavicle, the acromion (modeling the scapula), the upper arm, and the lower arm. The position of the sixteen anatomical points involved in the study were determined by an ultrasound-based pointer in the local coordinate system specified by the fundamental points before starting measurements. The ZEBRIS ultrasound-based motion analysis system was used for measuring the spatial coordinates of triplets in the course of continuous motion. The spatial coordinates of the designated anatomical points can be calculated by the method of triangulation. The method was calibrated by a ZEBRIS mapping (3DCAD) software commercially available, and the measurement error rate of the method was determined by statistical calculations. On the basis of calibration and error calculations it could be established that the accuracy and the reproducibility of the method were appropriate, in accordance with the limit values to be found in the literature.

AB  - CONTEXT: Increased contracture of the dominant posterior shoulder in throwing athletes has been associated with the development of altered shoulder rotational motion as well as several shoulder conditions. Clinicians must be able to accurately and reliably measure posterior shoulder contractures during the evaluation of such athletes in order to provide appropriate treatment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reliability and validity of assessing posterior shoulder contracture by measuring supine glenohumeral (GH) horizontal adduction. DESIGN: Descriptive with repeated measures. SETTING: The biomechanics laboratory at Illinois State University (Normal, IL) and the athletic training room in Surprise, AZ. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four shoulders were tested in 12 subjects (age = 21.9 +/- 4.3 years, height = 175.0 +/- 10.0 cm, mass = 82.4 +/- 19.1 kg) for determination of reliability, and 46 shoulders were tested in 23 professional baseball pitchers (age = 21.25 +/- 1.66 years, height = 190.0 +/- 5.0 cm, mass = 88.45 +/- 6.99 kg) for determination of validity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We examined intratester and intertester reliability over 3 testing sessions by having 2 examiners measure GH horizontal adduction with the subject in a supine position with the scapula stabilized. To determine the validity and clinical usefulness of this measurement, we examined the relationship between GH horizontal adduction motion and internal shoulder rotational motion among a group of baseball pitchers. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients were high for intratester (0.93, SEM = 1.64 degrees ) and intertester (0.91, SEM = 1.71 degrees ) measurements. This measurement was also shown to have a moderate to good relationship with lost internal shoulder rotational motion ( r = .72, P = .001) of the dominant arm among the baseball pitchers. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, we found that measuring GH horizontal adduction with the subject supine and the scapula stabilized is a reliable and valid technique for assessing posterior shoulder contracture.

AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To date, studies of glenohumeral stress forces have been based on the notion of a unique center of rotation situated at the geometric center of the humeral head. Early work, e.g. Fisher et al in 1977, suggested that the instantaneous center of rotation can migrate during abduction producing muscle vectors with variable moments and consequently variable stress forces. We conducted a kinematic analysis of the shoulder forces during continuous movement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An imaging device commonly used for angiography enabled acquisition of one image per second during a continuous movement of abduction. Images were obtained for twenty healthy shoulders in ten subjects. RESULTS: The instantaneous center of rotation was not situated at the geometric center of the humeral head. Although interindividual variability was significant, the preferential positions of the instantaneous center of rotation implied a constant reproducible succession of gliding, rolling, and translation in variable proportions during the abduction movement. When the same movement was performed with a 3500g load held in the hand, the ICR migrated towards the upper part of the humeral head implying a predominance of the rolling motion over the gliding and translation motions. Between 40 degrees and 60 degrees glenohumeral abduction, the instantaneous center of rotation exhibited a metaphyseal displacement producing a longer lever arm for the supaspinatus and an abduction function for the infraspinatus and the subscapularis, unrecognized to date. After 60 degrees, medialization of the instantaneous center of rotation lengthened the lever arm of the deltoid. DISCUSSION: A valid analysis of the glenohumeral stress forces must take into consideration the localization of the instantaneous center of rotation. In the clinical setting, our findings demonstrate that the infraspinatus and the subscapularis play an important role which must be considered both in surgery and in rehabilitation.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Scapular muscle performance evaluated with a handheld dynamometer (HHD) has been investigated only in people without shoulder dysfunction for test-retest reliability of data obtained with a single scapular muscle test. The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability, error, and validity of data obtained with an HHD for 4 scapular muscle tests in subjects with shoulder pain and functional loss. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects (N=40) with shoulder pain and functional loss were tested by measuring the kilograms applied with an HHD during 3 trials for muscle tests for the lower trapezius, upper trapezius, middle trapezius, and serratus anterior muscles. Concurrently, surface electromyography (sEMG) data were collected for the 4 muscles. The same procedures were performed 24 to 72 hours after the initial testing by the same tester. Muscle tests were performed 3 times, and the results were averaged for data analysis. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients for intratester reliability of measurements of isometric force obtained using an HHD ranged from .89 to .96. The standard error of the measure (90% confidence interval [CI]) ranged from 1.3 to 2.7 kg; the minimal detectable change (90% CI) ranged from 1.8 to 3.6 kg. Construct validity assessment, done by comparing the amounts of isometric muscle activity (sEMG) for each muscle across the 4 muscle tests, revealed that the muscle activity of the upper trapezius and lower trapezius muscles was highest during their respective tests. Conversely, the isometric muscle activity of the middle trapezius and serratus anterior muscles was not highest during their respective tests. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In people with shoulder pain and functional loss, the intrarater reliability and error over 1 to 3 days were established using an HHD for measurement of isometric force for the assessment of scapular muscle performance. Error values can be used to make decisions regarding individual patients. Construct validity was established for the lower and upper trapezius muscle tests; therefore, these tests are advocated for use. However, construct validity was not demonstrated for the serratus anterior and middle trapezius muscle tests as performed in this study. Further investigation of these muscle tests is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is important to deal with the scapula when developing rehabilitation strategies for the shoulder complex. This requires clinical measurement tools that are readily available and easy to apply and which provide a reliable evaluation of scapula motion. AIM: To determine the reliability of the Plurimeter-V gravity inclinometer for the measurement of scapular upward rotation positions during humeral elevation in coronal abduction in a group of patients with shoulder pathology. METHOD: Twenty six patients were assessed in two repeat tests within a single testing session. Patients exhibiting a wide spectrum of shoulder pathology were selected. The angle of scapular upward rotation was measured during total shoulder abduction. The measurement protocol was performed twice during a single testing session by a single tester. Results of the two tests were compared and the reliability assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the scapula measurements taken during the two tests at each testing position. Overall, there was very good intrarater reliability (ICC = 0.88). The ICC ranged from 0.81 (at 135 degrees) to 0.94 (at both resting and end of total shoulder abduction range). CONCLUSION: The Plurimeter-V gravity inclinometer can be used effectively and reliably for measuring upward rotation of the scapula in all ranges of shoulder abduction in the coronal plane.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the interobserver reliability, internal consistency, and clinical importance of 3 clinical tests for the assessment of scapular positioning in patients with shoulder pain. DESIGN: Prospective repeated-measures design. SETTING: Private practices for physical therapy and hospital outpatient physical therapy divisions. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-nine patients with shoulder pain who were diagnosed by a physician as having a shoulder disorder. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Study participants filled in a visual analog scale for pain and the Shoulder Disability Questionnaire. Next, 2 assessors performed the following tests: measurement of the distance between the posterior border of the acromion and the table, measurement of the distance from the medial scapular border to the fourth thoracic spinous processes, and the lateral scapular slide test. RESULTS: The interobserver reliability coefficients were greater than .88 (intraclass correlation coefficients) for the measurement of the distance between the posterior border of the acromion and the table, were greater than .50 for the measurement of the distance from the medial scapular border to the fourth thoracic spinous processes, and were greater than .70 for the lateral scapular slide test. The Cronbach alpha coefficient for internal consistency for all tests was .88. No associations between the outcome of the tests and self-reported pain severity or disability were found. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence favoring the interobserver reliability of 2 of 3 tests for the assessment of scapular positioning in patients with shoulder pain. The clinical importance of the tests' outcomes, however, is questionable.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate a new clinical test, the resisted supination external rotation test, for the diagnosis of superior labral anterior posterior lesions of the shoulder. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Forty athletes (average age, 23.9 years) with activity-related shoulder pain were enrolled in the study. The patients underwent 3 different tests designed specifically to detect superior labral anterior posterior lesions (the resisted supination external rotation test, the crank test, and the active compression test); the tests were performed in a random order on the affected shoulder. The results of the tests were compared with arthroscopic findings. RESULTS: Out of 40 athletes, 29 (72.5%) had superior labral anterior posterior tears. The resisted supination external rotation test had the highest sensitivity (82.8%), specificity (81.8%), positive predictive value (92.3%), negative predictive value (64.3%), and diagnostic accuracy (82.5%) of all tests performed. CONCLUSION: By re-creating the peel-back mechanism, the resisted supination external rotation test is more accurate than 2 other commonly used physical examination tests designed to diagnose superior labral anterior posterior tears in overhead-throwing athletes. By using this test in the context of a thorough clinical history and physical examination, lesions of the superior labrum can be more reliably diagnosed.

AB  - Repetitive pointing movements to remembered proprioceptive targets were investigated to determine whether dynamic proprioception could be used to modify the initial sensorimotor conditions associated with an active definition of the target position. Twelve blindfolded subjects used proprioception to reproduce a self-selected target position as accurately as possible. Ten repetitions for each limb were completed using overhead and scapular plane pointing tasks. A 3D optical tracking system determined hand trajectory start and endpoint positions for each repetition. These positions quantified three-dimensional pointing errors relative to the target position and the initial and preceding movement repetitions, as well as changes in movement direction and extent. Target position and cumulative start position errors were significantly greater than the corresponding preceding movement (inter-repetition) errors, and increased as the trial progressed. In contrast, hand trajectory start and endpoint inter-repetition errors decreased significantly with repeated task performance, as did movement extent, although it was consistently underestimated for each repetition. Pointing direction remained constant, except for the angle of elevation for scapular plane pointing, which consistently decreased throughout the trial. The results suggest that the initial conditions prescribed by actively defining a proprioceptive target were subsequently modified by dynamic proprioception, such that movement reproduction capability improved with repeated task performance.

AB  - The high prevalence of shoulder-related dysfunction has focused increased attention on functional activity assessment. This study (1) tested the reliability of three-dimensional shoulder complex movements during four functional tasks representing different levels of task difficulty, (2) characterized the four functional tasks, and (3) examined the relationships between age and shoulder movements. Twenty-five asymptomatic subjects, all veterans aged 30-82, performed the four functional tasks. Good within-session reliability was found (movement pattern: similarity index = 0.81 to 0.97, peak values: intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.88 to 0.99). The raising arm to overhead height task (hard task) placed the greatest demand on scapular motions and humeral elevation (p < 0.005). During the functional tasks, significant correlations existed between age and scapular tipping, humeral elevation, and scapular upward rotation (r = -0.62 to 0.50, p < 0.05). Correlation results indicated that elderly subjects have a greater potential for serratus anterior muscle weakness and shoulder capsule tightness.

AB  - Measurement of scapular kinematics is an important component in the assessment of shoulder function; however, repeatability of these measurements has not been established. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine the repeatability of scapular rotation measures for different humeral elevation planes between trials, sessions, and days. Three-dimensional scapular rotations were collected using an electromagnetic tracking system in three planes of humeral elevation. Coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC) values were calculated between trials, sessions, and days for curves of scapular rotations. CMC values were compared with repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVAs) and Tukey's post-hoc procedures. Tests of simple main effects were performed for significant interaction effects. Our results suggest that scapular rotation measures are repeatable between trials within the same testing session, but less repeatable between testing sessions and days. Sagittal plane elevation consistently yielded the highest CMC values for all scapular rotations. These results suggest sagittal plane elevation should be considered to evaluate differences in scapular rotations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scapular function during humeral elevation has been reported in groups with and without shoulder impingement pathology. To date, no one has assessed scapular kinematics during upper extremity loaded tasks that manual wheelchair users must perform on a daily basis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare scapular kinematics and muscle activation patterns during two different wheelchair transfers in groups of manual wheelchair users with and without shoulder impingement. METHODS: A case controlled study of manual wheelchair users, with and without shoulder impingement was performed. Twenty-three male manual wheelchair users (13 without shoulder impingement, 10 with shoulder impingement) performed transfers toward the involved or dominant limb (lead limb transfer) and away from the instrumented limb (trail limb transfer). Position and orientation measures of the thorax, scapula and humerus were obtained using an electromagnetic tracking system. Muscle activity data were collected using telemetered electromyography. Each subject performed three trials of wheelchair transfers to each side. FINDINGS: Manual wheelchair users with impingement performed transfers with reduced thoracic flexion, increased scapular internal rotation, and increased humeral internal rotation as compared to those without impingement. Differences were found between the tasks in the scapular motions and EMG amplitude. Trail limb transfer presented with reduced scapular upward rotation and posterior tip as compared to the lead limb transfer task. Increased muscle activity for the lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles was demonstrated in the trail limb transfer. INTERPRETATION: This study provides the first kinematic description of scapular kinematics during transfer tasks. Shoulder impingement and direction of transfer does affect transfer task performance in manual wheelchair users. Scapular kinematics and muscle patterns during transfers may predispose manual wheelchair users to the development of shoulder pathology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scapular activity during shoulder motion is critical for normal shoulder function. With aging, muscle function deteriorates in almost all people, which may lead to shoulder impingement syndrome. METHODS: Forty-four normal subjects, 23 men and 21 women aged from 16 to 73 years with a mean age 48, were enrolled in the study. Static antero-posterior radiography at both 0 degrees and 90 degrees of abduction were undertaken and correlation between age and scapular orientations were evaluated by Pearson's correlation coefficient test. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between aging and scapulo-thoracic orientation. FINDINGS: Significant correlation coefficients were observed between aging and scapular orientations. With the shoulder at 0 degrees abduction, posterior tilt showed significant negative correlation with aging. At 90 degrees abduction, both posterior tilt and upward rotation angle correlated negatively with aging. The correlation was apparent at 90 degrees abduction. INTERPRETATION: The results indicate that shoulder aging closely relates to changes of scapular orientation, which consist of decreases of the posterior tilt at 0 degrees and 90 degrees abduction and the upward rotation angle at 90 degrees. The current study indicated that one of the effects of aging on the shoulder is a decrease of posterior tilt and upward rotation angle as seen in an abducted position; and that these alterations are similar to the scapular kinematics of shoulder impingement syndrome. By taking this concept into consideration, the effects of aging on shoulder kinematics can be appropriately evaluated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subjects with idiopathic loss of shoulder motion have difficulty sleeping, performing overhead activities, and completing activities of daily living. Treatment has been variable in approach and success. Cyriax's proposed shoulder capsular pattern was external rotation most limited followed by abduction followed by internal rotation. This investigation was performed to determine if a consistent pattern of motion loss was present in subjects with idiopathic loss of shoulder motion. METHODS: Repeated measurement of 25 (22 female) subjects' bilateral shoulder patterns of motion were compared. The three-dimensional position of the scapula and humerus throughout active shoulder abduction, external rotation, flexion, internal rotation, and scapular plane abduction was evaluated with an electromagnetic motion capture system. Patterns of motion loss were determined for both shoulders. The proportions of peak shoulder motion to mean maximum non-involved shoulders abduction, external, and internal rotation were utilized to determine the pattern of motion loss. FINDINGS: There was a significant difference in motion loss patterns between the involved and non-involved shoulders with the arm at the side. The internal rotation less than abduction less than external rotation pattern was demonstrated in 14 of 25 (56%) involved shoulders. No pattern was present in 14 of 21 (67%) non-involved shoulders. With the arm abducted, internal rotation was the most limited motion in 23 of 25 (92%) involved shoulders. INTERPRETATION: The results did not support Cyriax's proposed glenohumeral capsular pattern. Defining the pattern of motion loss in subjects with idiopathic loss of shoulder motion may assist in diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - At the end ranges of motion, the glenohumeral capsule limits translation of the humeral head in multiple directions. Since the 6-degree of freedom kinematics of clinical tests are commonly utilized to diagnose shoulder injuries, the objective of this study was to determine the magnitude and repeatability of glenohumeral joint kinematics during a simulated simple anteroposterior translation test in the anterior and posterior directions. A magnetic tracking system was used to determine the kinematics of the humerus with respect to the scapula in eight cadaveric shoulders. At 60 degrees of glenohumeral abduction and 0 degrees of flexion/extension, a clinician applied anterior and posterior loads to the humerus at 0 degrees, 30 degrees, and 60 degrees of external rotation until a manual maximum (simulating a simple translation test) was achieved. Prior to each test, the reference position of the humerus shifted posteriorly 1.8+/-2.0 and 4.1+/-3.8 mm at 30 degrees and 60 degrees of external rotation, respectively. Anterior translation decreased significantly (p < 0.05) from 18.2+/-5.3 mm at 0 degrees of external rotation to 15.5+/-5.1 and 9.9+/-5.5 mm at 30 degrees and 60 degrees, respectively. However, no significant differences were detected between the posterior translations of 13.4+/-6.4, 17.1+/-5.0, and 15.8+/-6.0 mm at 0 degrees, 30 degrees, and 60 degrees of external rotation, respectively. Coupled translations (perpendicular to the direction of loading) at 0 degrees (6.1+/-4.0 and 3.8+/-2.9 mm), 30 degrees (4.7+/-2.7 and 5.9+/-3.1 mm), and 60 degrees (2.3+/-2.3 and 5.0+/-3.5 mm) of external rotation were in the inferior direction in both the anterior and posterior directions, respectively. Based on the data obtained, performing a simulated simple translation test should result in coupled inferior translations and anterior translations that are a function of external rotation. The low standard deviations demonstrate that the observed translations should be repeatable. Furthermore, capsular stretching or injury to the anterior-inferior region of the capsule should be detectable during clinical examination if excessive coupled translations exist or no posterior shift of the reference position with external rotation is noted.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective single-group repeated-measures design. OBJECTIVE: To use electromyographic (EMG) analysis during muscle testing to determine if there is a difference in function of the upper and lower parts of the serratus anterior (SA) muscle. BACKGROUND: The SA muscle is a very important scapular protractor and upward rotator. Authors have anatomically described the muscle as being divided into 2 or 3 parts, and have suggested that the upper part is more suited for protraction and the lower part for upward rotation of the scapula. METHODS AND MEASURES: Surface electrodes recorded EMG activity of the upper and lower parts of the SA muscle during 9 different muscle tests in 29 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Three muscle tests demonstrated significantly greater (P<.05) EMG activity in the lower part of the SA as compared to the upper part. There was no significant difference in the EMG activity of the upper and lower parts of the SA when the other 6 muscle tests were analyzed. CONCLUSION: When upward rotation was the primary position of the scapula during the muscle tests, the lower part of the SA was activated to a greater degree than the upper part. Muscle tests with maximum scapular protraction with varying degrees of upward rotation produced EMG activity with no significant difference when comparing the upper and lower parts of the SA. This information may be helpful for clinicians when muscle testing and developing exercise programs for the SA muscle.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although it is used in clinical practice, there are no data concerning scapular elevation during glenohumeral abduction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scapular elevation of 30 healthy volunteers in supine and sitting positions were measured at 90-180 deg of glenohumeral abduction by two examiners. In addition, radiographs of the ten subjects were taken in supine position at 0-180 deg of glenohumeral abduction, and the scapular elevation measurements were repeated. Also, the movements of five anatomical landmarks (acromioclavicular joint, center of glenoid cavity, scapular notch, angulus superior and inferior) were measured with regard to transverse and vertical axes. RESULTS: The values obtained for scapular elevation during 90, 120, 150, and 180 deg of glenohumeral abduction were (mean and SD) 26.63 and 3.96, 31.77 and 4.36, 35.97 and 5.15, 40.10 and 5.18 deg, respectively. There were no significant differences with regard to side, gender, and position of the subject. No correlation was found between the clinical and radiological measurements. Movements of certain points did not reveal progressive upward motion. CONCLUSION: There is no scapular elevation but rather rotation during glenohumeral joint abduction. Normal values given in the present study can be used in clinical examinations.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. OBJECTIVES: To determine the reliability of a surface sensor measurement of clavicular motion during arm elevation and to describe 3-dimensional clavicular motion in an asymptomatic population. BACKGROUND: Abnormal scapular motion on the thorax has been implicated in shoulder pathology. Without the ability to measure clavicular motion, it is not possible to identify if abnormal scapular motions derive from the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. METHODS AND MEASURES: Thirty-nine subjects participated in the investigation, including an asymptomatic group (n = 30) and a group with a history or current symptoms of shoulder pathology (n = 9). Clavicular angles relative to the thorax were tracked with surface electromagnetic sensors on the thorax, clavicle, and humerus as subjects completed humeral flexion, scapular plane abduction, and abduction. Within-day reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients and SEM. Descriptive statistics quantified sternoclavicular joint motions for the various arm movements. RESULTS: Reliable measurements were obtained, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.93 to 0.99, and SEMs from 0.9 degrees to 1.8 degrees. Between-day reliability SEM values were generally 2 degrees to 4 degrees. During elevation of the arm, the clavicle with respect to the thorax generally undergoes elevation (11 degrees-15 degrees maximum), retraction (15 degrees-29 degrees maximum), and posterior long-axis rotation (15 degrees-31 degrees maximum), with variability between subjects and planes of motion regarding the magnitude of motion. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation approaches attempting to improve shoulder motion should benefit from improved knowledge of 3-dimensional contributions of the clavicle to normal and abnormal scapular kinematics.

AB  - The accuracy of measuring angulation of stable proximal humerus fractures using the axillary lateral projection was investigated. A closing wedge osteotomy with apex anterior angulation was performed on two cadaveric humeri to simulate a stable surgical neck fracture. One specimen was fixed at 30 degrees angulation and the other at 55 degrees. Axillary radiographs were taken with each specimen articulating with the glenoid of a cadaveric scapula. The humerus was held in neutral rotation. Abduction was set at 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees. In each position of abduction, an axillary lateral radiograph was taken in 30 degrees forward flexion, neutral, and 30 degrees extension to simulate various arm positions. A total of nine radiographs were taken for each specimen. The axillary view is not accurate for measurement of proximal humerus angulation at the arm positions commonly encountered in the trauma setting.

AB  - PURPOSE: In C5 and C6 brachial plexus avulsion lesions, elbow flexion, shoulder abduction, and external rotation are the functions that need to be restored. Because the proximal stumps are not available for grafting, surgical repair is based on nerve transfers. The purpose of this study was to describe and report the results of the use of multiple nerve transfers in the reconstruction of these avulsion injuries. METHODS: Ten patients had multiple nerve transfers: cranial nerve XI to the suprascapular nerve, ulnar nerve fascicles to the biceps motor branch, and triceps long or lateral head motor branch to the axillary nerve. Triceps branch transfer was performed through a posterior arm incision. RESULTS: Two years after surgery, all the patients had recovered full elbow flexion; 7 scored M4 and 3 scored M3+ according to Medical Research Council scoring. All the patients had recovered active abduction and external rotation. Abduction recovery averaged 92 degrees (range, 65 degrees-120 degrees) and external rotation, measured from full internal rotation, averaged 93 degrees (range, 80 degrees-120 degrees). Shoulder abduction strength was graded M4 in 3 patients and M3 in the remaining 7 patients. Shoulder external rotation strength was graded M4 in 2 patients, M3 in 5 patients, and M2 in 3 patients. No donor site deficits were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed nerve transfers constitute a valid strategy in C5-C6 avulsion injury reconstruction.

AB  - The morphology of the glenoid cavity is highly variable, and no consensus exists regarding how to classify the different forms. We examined 98 dry scapulae to identify a common morphological entity and to define reproducible bony references of the glenoid cavity. The glenoid cavities were photographed perpendicularly in a standardized fashion. The bony peripheral rim was studied on these two-dimensional images, defined by randomly chosen points in order to define one or more circles. This study showed that only the peripheral rim of the inferior quadrants of the articular surface was found to be located on a circle ( P=0.926) with a radius of 12.8 mm (SD 1.3 mm). Defining the center of this circle appeared to be more reliable (ICC 0.98) than determining the middle point of the longitudinal axis (0,0) between the most cranial and most caudal points, defined as Saller's line (ICC 0.89). The distance of the center of this projected circle to the middle point of Saller's line had a unimodal distribution, suggesting the existence of only one glenoid cavity morphotype. We then investigated the relationship between the center of the circle and the area of subchondral bone thickening under the bare spot, the so-called tubercle of Assaki. Ten phenolized cadaveric glenoid cavities were examined with computed tomography. A circle was projected on the first image showing the bony peripheral rim, and this circle was copied on the consecutive slices until the tubercle of Assaki came across. The center of the circle was located within the area of the tubercle of Assaki, in all but one specimen. To investigate the clinical implications of this finding, the cadaver specimens were used to compare the position of the center of the circle with the postulated center of implantation according to the literature, and to the reference guide for a commonly used total shoulder prosthesis. The center of the circle was consistently situated more distal than the postulated center of the guide (mean 5.5 mm, range 4-8 mm) and the middle point of the glenoid cavity (mean 2 mm, range 1-3 mm). These findings could offer a reproducible point of reference for the glenoid cavity in osseous anthropometry and a valuable reference in shoulder replacement surgery, and might help in the definition of osseous glenohumeral instability.

AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this work was to propose an objective radiographic evaluation of the antero-inferior gleno-humeral ligament for comparison with the clinical assessment proposed by Gagey. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A test radiogram was obtained from 32 healthy volunteers (15 men, 17 women, mean age, 29 years, age range 21-54 years) free of shoulder disease. The dynamic test image consisted in a strictly AP view of the shoulder in forced abduction in neutral rotation. The subjects were awake and in dorsal decubitus. Displacements of the scapulo-thoracic articulation were limited by a counter-force applied to the acromion, in accordance with the method described by Gagey. Bilateral images were obtained for comparison. Several angles were measured between the humeral shaft and the scapula to search for the most reliable and reproducible measurement. RESULTS: Three series of angles were measured between the axis of the humeral shaft and the scapula. The mean angle between the axis of the humeral shaft and line drawn from the lower rim of the glenoid cavity to the lateral border of the scapular tubercle was 130.3 degrees (range 110-148 degrees) on the dominant side and 131.5 degrees (108-148 degrees) on the non-dominant side; giving 38 degrees variability on the dominant side and 40 degrees variation on the non-dominant side and a standard deviation of 10.4 degrees on the dominant side and 11.5 degrees on the non-dominant side. The mean difference in gleno-humeral abduction was 3.8 degrees (range 0-14 degrees) between the dominant and non-dominant side. DISCUSSION: Among the different angles measured between the scapula and the humerus, the angle between the axis of the humeral shaft and the line drawn from the lower rim of the glenoid cavity to the lateral border of the scapular tubercle was the most reliable and reproducible. Inter-observer measurements were well correlated. We observed that the variability in the radiographic values of the scapulo-humeral angle was much greater than the clinical values described by Gagey who, finding very constant values during forced abduction, described "invariable" scapulo-humeral abduction of the shoulder. Our study demonstrates that scapulo-humeral abduction is not an invariable parameter. More interestingly, the difference in amplitude between the dominant and non-dominant sides showed very strong interindividual correlation. Interobserver variability was low and reproducibility was good. CONCLUSION: This dynamic radiographic test enables a precise quantified assessment of pure gleno-humeral abduction which depends on the antero-inferior gleno-humeral ligament. This test is reliable and reproducible. Variations in the length of the antero-inferior gleno-humeral ligament evaluated radiographically were greater than described clinically. We did not find any difference in pure gleno-humeral abduction greater than 14 degrees between the dominant and non-dominant sides in healthy subjects.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This study used a prospective, single-group repeated-measures design to analyze differences between the electromyographic (EMG) amplitudes produced by exercises for the trapezius and serratus anterior muscles. OBJECTIVE: To identify high-intensity exercises that elicit the greatest level of EMG activity in the trapezius and serratus anterior muscles. BACKGROUND: The trapezius and serratus anterior muscles are considered to be the only upward rotators of the scapula and are important for normal shoulder function. Electromyographic studies have been performed for these muscles during active and low-intensity exercises, but they have not been analyzed during high intensity exercises. METHODS AND MEASURES: Surface electrodes recorded EMG activity of the upper, middle, and lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles during 10 exercises in 30 healthy subjects. RESULTS: The unilateral shoulder shrug exercise was found to produce the greatest EMG activity in the upper trapezius. For the middle trapezius, the greatest EMG amplitudes were generated with 2 exercises: shoulder horizontal extension with external rotation and the overhead arm raise in line with the lower trapezius muscle in the prone position. The arm raise overhead exercise in the prone position produced the maximum EMG activity in the lower trapezius. The serratus anterior was activated maximally with exercises requiring a great amount of upward rotation of the scapula. The exercises were shoulder abduction in the plane of the scapula above 120 degrees and a diagonal exercise with a combination of shoulder flexion, horizontal flexion, and external rotation. CONCLUSION: This study identified exercises that maximally activate the trapezius and serratus anterior muscles. This information may be helpful for clinicians in developing exercise programs for these muscles.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe patterns of external rotation during humeral elevation, and to compare motion patterns.Design. Patterns of external rotation during forward flexion, scapular abduction and abduction in the frontal plane are described with P-spline curves with an approximately 95% confidence interval. BACKGROUND: External rotation of the humerus is an essential part of humeral elevation. Standard clinical assessment of external rotation provides insufficient information to describe external rotation patterns which may be essential for insight in shoulder disorders.Methods. The dominant and non-dominant arms of thirty subjects are measured, using a three-dimensional electromagnetic movement recording system. RESULTS: Overall group patterns demonstrate that humeral elevation in all planes is accompanied by about 55 degrees of external rotation, and each elevation plane has its own typical pattern. The dominant and non-dominant sides are comparable and can be combined. CONCLUSIONS: There are specific external rotation patterns for each elevation plane. Curves representing the approximately 95% confidence intervals make comparison between groups possible. This method can therefore possibly be used to study the external rotation patterns in groups with certain shoulder disorders to evaluate the results of before and after treatment. RELEVANCE: The method presented in this paper can be used to study external rotation patterns in healthy shoulders and in shoulders with a specific disorders to gain more insight, to define functional treatment, and to evaluate the results of treatment.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the intrarater and interrater reliability of a clinical evaluation system for scapular dysfunction. No commonly accepted terminology presently exists for describing the abnormal dynamic scapular movement patterns that are commonly associated with shoulder injury. A method of observation was devised for clinical evaluation of scapular dysfunction. Blinded evaluators (2 physicians and 2 physical therapists) were familiarized with the evaluation method of scapular movement patterns before viewing a videotape of 26 subjects with and without scapular dysfunction. Each evaluator was asked to categorize the predominant scapular movement pattern observed during bilateral humeral scaption and abduction motions. Reliability was assessed by a kappa coefficient. Intertester reliability (kappa = 0.4) was found to be slightly lower than intratester reliability (kappa = 0.5). These results indicate that, with refinement, this qualitative evaluation method may allow clinicians to standardize the categorization of dynamic scapular dysfunction patterns.

AB  - External shoulder impingement is commonly diagnosed by passively moving the shoulder into various positions of elevation and internal rotation in order to perform impingement sign maneuvers. There is a lack of agreement among clinicians regarding the positions of the anatomic structures in the subacromial space when these maneuvers are performed. The purpose of this study was to use magnetic resonance imaging to identify and measure the changes in anatomic structures in the subacromial space as the arm was moved from complete rest to 160 degrees of forward flexion during the Neer and Hawkins impingement sign maneuvers. Ten subjects with normal shoulders (mean age, 32 years) were studied. The acromiohumeral interval was smallest with the arm at the side (mean, 6.4 mm) and progressively increased as the arm was elevated from 90 degrees to 160 degrees (mean, 7.7-14.2 mm). In no instance was the rotator cuff found to be in contact with the anterior acromion. The rotator cuff insertion appeared to be in closest proximity to the anteroinferior acromion, not at full elevation (Neer sign position), but at 90 degrees of flexion (Hawkins sign position). Our data suggest that a clinically positive Hawkins sign is consistent with external shoulder impingement. Clinical suspicion that mechanisms other than impingement may be involved, particularly if the Neer impingement sign is also positive, is nonetheless advised.

AB  - New trends of numerical models of human joints require more and more computation of both large amplitude joint motions and fine bone stress distribution. Together, these problems are difficult to solve and very CPU time consuming. The goal of this study is to develop a new method to diminish the calculation time for this kind of problems which include calculation of large amplitude motions and infinitesimal strains. Based on the Principle of Virtual Power, the present method decouples the problem into two parts. First, rigid body motion is calculated. The bone micro-deformations are then calculated in a second part by using the results of rigid body motions as boundary conditions. A finite element model of the shoulder was used to test this decoupling technique. The model was designed to determine the influence of humeral head shape on stress distribution in the scapula for different physiological motions of the joint. Two versions of the model were developed: a first version completely deformable and a second version based on the developed decoupling method. It was shown that biomechanical variables, as mean pressure and von Mises stress, calculated with the two versions were sensibly the same. On the other hand, CPU time needed for calculating with the new decoupled technique was more than 6 times less than with the completely deformable model.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare scapular orientation during both the concentric (elevation) and eccentric (lowering) phases of scapular plane abduction in subjects with and without shoulder impingement. DESIGN: Mixed model analysis of variance with one between-subjects factor (group) and within-subjects factors of phase, humeral angle, and trial. BACKGROUND: Abnormal scapular kinematics have been identified in shoulder impingement patients during the concentric phase of arm elevation, and under static conditions. Because abnormal scapular motion is observed clinically during the eccentric phase of arm elevation, analysis of this phase of motion is warranted. METHODS: Twenty-six symptomatic and 26 healthy subjects performed five repetitions of humeral scapular plane abduction. An electromagnetic tracking device described three-dimensional scapular kinematics during arm elevation and lowering. Angular values for scapular anterior/posterior tipping in the sagittal plane, upward/downward rotation in the scapular plane, and internal/external rotation in the transverse plane were calculated. Scapular orientation relative to the thorax at humeral angles of 40 degrees, 60 degrees, 80 degrees, 100 degrees, and 120 degrees was statistically tested for effects of phase and trial, or for interactions of phase with group or humeral angle. RESULTS: Internal rotation was significantly increased in the eccentric phase for both groups at the 100 degrees angle (P<0.05) and for the symptomatic group only at the 120 degrees angle (P<0.05). Scapular anterior tipping was significantly decreased during the eccentric phase in both groups at the 80 degrees (P<0.001), 100 degrees (P<0.0001), and 120 degrees (P<0.0001) angles. CONCLUSIONS: Small but statistically significant differences in scapular tipping and internal rotation during the eccentric phase of arm elevation were identified at higher humeral angles in both subject groups, while no significant phase differences for scapular upward rotation or for scapular variables at lower humeral angles were found. Averaged across phases, the symptomatic group demonstrated significant reductions in upward rotation at lower humeral elevation angles, and significant increases in anterior tipping at higher elevation angles as compared to the healthy group. RELEVANCE: Normal and abnormal scapular kinematics during varying types of motion need to be understood in order to optimally design rehabilitation programs for individuals with impingement syndrome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the reliability of shoulder internal rotation (IR) range of motion (ROM) measured using 3 different methods: standard technique, manual scapular stabilization technique, and visual inspection technique. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Clinic-based sports medicine center. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 56 unimpaired high-school athlete volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Shoulder IR ROM was measured by using a digital inclinometer with each of the 3 techniques. All measurements were performed independently by 2 groups of examiners and repeated to determine intra- and interrater reliabilities. RESULTS: IR ROM measurements obtained with the scapula stabilized or by visual inspection were significantly less than when measured with the standard technique (P=.001). Intrarater reliability was good or excellent for all 3 methods (intraclass correlation coefficients=.63-.71), was similar for the scapular stabilization and visual inspection techniques, and was superior to that previously reported for similar measurements. In general, interrater reliability was lower than intrarater reliability for all measurements. CONCLUSION: Because the visual inspection and scapular stabilized techniques control for accessory scapulothoracic motion, these techniques may represent more valid measures of glenohumeral motion than the standard technique. Both the visual inspection and scapular stabilized techniques exhibited equally acceptable reliability for clinical use. However, because the visual inspection technique may be applied by a single examiner, we recommend its use to measure shoulder IR ROM in the clinical setting.

AB  - Biomechanical investigations are yet necessary to better understand the origin of the glenoïd loosening which is the main reason for revision surgery. The aim of this study was to analyse the behaviour of cadaveric glenoïds before and after implantation of glenoïd prostheses. For that, we developed a new experimental protocol allowing measurement of bone strains and implants displacements under various loading cases. Ten pairs of fresh cadaveric scapulae were tested. Two kinds of loads were applied on the intact glenoïd: physiological loads corresponding to a 0-180 degrees abduction and anteflexion movements, and 500N loads. The glenoïds were then implanted with a keeled or pegged cemented polyethylene implant. The same previous 500N loads were then applied on the implanted glenoïds. Strains were measured using six strain gages placed on precise points around the peripheral cortex of the glenoïd. Displacements of implants under loading were measured using two CCD cameras. Maximum strains were obtained between 60 degrees and 120 degrees of abduction or anteflexion. They were located at the anterior and antero-superior parts of the glenoïd during abduction and at the posterior and postero-superior parts during anteflexion. Implantation of a prosthetic component generally seemed to increase strains, but tensile strains were decreased at the postero-inferior part with the antero-inferior loading point.Some differences were observed between the implants, but they have to be confirmed by further experiments. The great number of data obtained for intact scapulae could be used for a better understanding of glenoïd behaviour and for validation of finite element models.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare thoracic spine alignment with two- and three-dimensional calculations of shoulder alignment (defined as a line joining the acromion processes of the right and left scapula) when all measures were projected onto the transverse plane. A six-camera Vicon system was used to reconstruct three markers positioned on the plane of the thorax such that the orthogonal vector to the thoracic spine, projected onto the transverse plane, was used as a virtual shoulder alignment during cricket fast bowling. This same measurement system was used to calculate the three-dimensional line between the acromion processes projected onto the transverse plane. These acromion markers were also used to calculate the two-dimensional transverse plane alignment of the shoulders from images recorded by a video camera positioned above ball release. All cameras operated at 50 Hz. A significant association was recorded between thorax alignment and the three- (0.97) and two-dimensional (0.87) shoulder alignment estimations at back-foot impact. The strength of association remained at front-foot impact, when correlations of 0.89 (three-dimensional) and 0.84 (two-dimensional) were recorded. However, at ball release, non-significant associations of 0.58 (three-dimensional) and 0.41 (two-dimensional), representing shoulder alignment differences of approximately 10 degrees, were recorded. The 95% limits of agreement comparisons for shoulder alignment at back-foot impact, front-foot impact and ball release produced mean random errors for the two comparisons of 9.5 degrees, 11.7 degrees and 22.5 degrees respectively. Three- and two-dimensional transverse plane projections of shoulder alignment are reasonable estimates of thorax alignment at back-foot impact and front-foot impact but not at ball release.

AB  - A key feature in physiotherapeutic treatment of patients with motion disturbances is the appropriate ranging of the trunk and pelvis motility. Eighty subjects randomly selected and free from known pathology of the muscular-skeletal and/or of the neurological system classed into four groups according to the age and the sex have been assessed, by using a new, simple and easy administrable tool. Our results demonstrate that the new measurement tool showed a very low intra- and inter-observer variability, that healthy subjects showed a more adduced and elevated right scapula if compared to the contralateral one and, as regard as the pelvic motion, a broader joint excursion in passive motion compared with active motion in the overall group, a broader joint excursion in young subjects compared with elderly ones, and a broader joint excursion in female subjects compared with males subjects. In conclusion our study allowed to identify a range of physiological asymmetry and pelvis motility. Such a range of physiological asymmetry might be useful as a reference for the physiotherapists.

AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this work was to develop a goniometer with six degrees of freedom (6DOF) to achieve global measurement of the main movements of the shoulder and to examine the reproducibility of the measurements obtained. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Movement amplitudes, inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of the methodology and the device were tested in a population of ten young subjects with asymptomatic shoulders. RESULTS: Maximal amplitudes obtained for each movement were: abduction 111.8 +/- 11 degrees; flexion 127.9 +/- 12.7; external rotation 86.3 +/- 14 degrees; free elevation 129.3 +/- 9 degrees. The curves traced in the plane of rotation and rotation were plotted against elevation. Comparison between amplitudes on the right and left were not significantly different. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This preliminary study demonstrated the potential contribution of a 6DOF-goniometer for a 3D assessment of shoulder movement. Measurements made when positioning the goniometer demonstrated good reproducibility. Our data are similar to others reported in the literature. The plane of the scapula and the position in physiological internal rotation, as described in the literature, were also observed. Studying shoulder movements, particularly their association, should provide a new means of assessing function in patients with complex disease of the shoulder joint. The device should be helpful in obtaining an objective measurement of the shoulder kinetics that would be useful for patient follow-up and assessment of corporal damage.

AB  - The scapular elevation (shoulder shrug), depression, and total elevation-depression motion in 30 healthy subjects were measured by goniometer under standardized conditions. Mean values were 37.74, 8.39, and 44.60 deg, respectively. The intraobserver variation was calculated as 1.3 deg, and the interobserver variation was 1.8 deg. There was no difference between the sides. This previously unreported values may be used in the evaluation of shoulder and neck disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of MR imaging in the characterization of the Perthes lesion by correlating MR findings with findings at arthroscopy. CONCLUSION: The use of a combination of axial and abduction-external rotation position sequences on MR images can be helpful in the diagnosis of a Perthes lesion. A fluid-filled joint with capsular distension, caused by either a large amount of effusion or MR arthrography, was found to be helpful in outlining Perthes lesions. Adding the abduction-external rotation position to the protocol in patients in whom Perthes lesion is suspected will increase diagnostic accuracy and may reveal a Perthes lesion not visible on axial images, as was the case in 50% of the patients in our series.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether scapular downward tilt (ScDT) and dynamic scapular lateral rotation (ScLR) in subjects with and without stroke is associated with subluxation, and to prove the reliability of a Scapula Locator System in an elderly population. DESIGN: Repeated measures of ScLR by 2 observers. SETTING: Outpatient rehabilitation department of a district general hospital. PARTICIPANTS: To test device reliability, 5 healthy men (mean age +/- standard deviation, 72 +/- 5 yr). To test scapula position, 30 stroke patients (19 men, 11 women; mean age, 73 +/- 6 yr) and 15 healthy controls (12 men, 3 women; mean age, 62 +/- 6 yr). INTERVENTIONS: The control subjects' ScDT was compared with stroke subjects' ScDT after stratification according to 3 patterns of ScLR symmetry and the presence of palpable glenohumeral subluxation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For device reliability, 3-way analysis of variance. For scapula position, triangulated location by Scapula Locator System of acromion, inferior angle, and root of the scapular spine; then measurement of scapula motion to determine symmetry, lag, or lead. RESULTS: The inter- and intraobserver reliability of the Scapula Locator System device was high (1% of variance each). Normal ScDT was positive (left side: 10.94 degrees +/- 2.62 degrees; right side: 9.69 degrees +/- 4.36 degrees ), indicating a downward-facing glenoid fossa. This finding was unchanged by stroke (10.46 degrees +/- 2.42 degrees ). All controls and 16 stroke subjects had symmetry between shoulders for ScLR rate and ScDT. Two other patterns (p <.01) of ScLR were found after stroke: 8 subjects had a slower rate of affected arm ScLR (lag) with a correspondingly greater ScDT on the affected side (2.61 degrees +/- 6.7 degrees ); 6 subjects had a faster rate of affected arm ScLR (lead) but with an upward-facing glenoid fossa on the affected side (ScDT: -11.84 degrees +/- 8.48 degrees ). No significant inter- or intrasubject difference in ScDT existed in the 6 cases of glenohumeral subluxation. CONCLUSIONS: The scapula normally tilts downward with or without stroke. The effect of stroke is similar on tonic (ScDT) and phasic (ScLR) control of scapula position. Subluxation is not linked with a particular scapular resting position after stroke.

AB  - One of the signs advocated for monitoring during neurodynamic testing in the assessment of patients with upper quadrant disorders, is the response of the shoulder girdle. It is stated that a protective rising of the shoulder girdle is present when patients with neurogenic disorders are assessed and that the elevation is absent in asymptomatic subjects. As sensory responses are elicited in the majority of asymptomatic subjects and as the range of motion (ROM) is often limited during neurodynamic testing, it is questionable whether the elevation of the shoulder girdle would be absent in asymptomatic subjects. The aim of this study was to measure the shoulder girdle elevation force during five variants of the neural tissue provocation test for the median nerve. Thirty-five asymptomatic male subjects were assessed. A load cell was used to measure the amount of shoulder girdle elevation force and two electrogoniometers were used to measure the ROM at the elbow and wrist. When the ROM at the end of the test was restricted, a gradual increase in shoulder girdle elevation force could be observed throughout the test. Compared to the initial force at the start of the test, all variants resulted in a significant increase in force. It is concluded that a gradual increase in shoulder girdle elevation force should not be regarded as an abnormal sign in the interpretation of neurodynamic tests.

AB  - The validation of two noninvasive methods for measuring the dynamic three-dimensional kinematics of the human scapula with a magnetic tracking device is presented. One method consists of simply fixing a sensor directly to the acromion and the other consists of mounting a sensor to an adjustable plastic jig that fits over the scapular spine and acromion. The concurrent validity of both methods was assessed separately by comparison with data collected simultaneously from an invasive approach in which pins were drilled directly into the scapula. The differences between bone and skin based measurements represents an estimation of skin motion artifact. The average motion pattern of each surface method was similar to that measured by the invasive technique, especially below 120 degrees of elevation. These results indicate that with careful consideration, both methods may offer reasonably accurate representations of scapular motion that may be used to study shoulder pathologies and help develop computational models.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Test-retest repeated measures and correlational design. OBJECTIVES: To examine the reliability and validity of a "modified" digital inclinometer to assess scapular upward rotation during humeral elevation in the scapular plane BACKGROUND: Evidence exists that scapular motion is related to shoulder pathology; however, evaluation and treatment planning for shoulder rehabilitation often fails to include an objective assessment of scapular motion. METHODS AND MEASURES: Two-dimensional measurements by the inclinometer were taken with the arm in a static position. These data were compared to 3-dimensional measurements obtained using a magnetic tracking device with the arm fixed and during arm movement. Both methods were used to assess scapular upward rotation positions with the arm at rest and at 60 degrees , 90 degrees , and 120 degrees of humeral elevation in the scapular plane. Both scapulae were tested on a total of 39 subjects, 16 with shoulder pathology and 23 without. Reliability was assessed using repeated measurements from the inclinometer. Validity was assessed using 2 separate comparisons: inclinometer and magnetic tracking device under static arm conditions and inclinometer and magnetic tracking device during active arm elevation. Reliability and validity were assessed at all 4 arm positions. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC [3,1]) varied from 0.89 to 0.96. Pearson Product Moment correlation coefficients, used to assess validity of the static inclinometer, varied from r = 0.74 to 0.92 compared with the static magnetic tracking measures, and from r = 0.59 to 0.73 compared with the active magnetic tracking measures taken during arm elevation. CONCLUSIONS: The "modified" digital inclinometer demonstrated good to excellent intrarater reliability and good to excellent validity when measuring scapular upward rotation during static positions of humeral elevation in the scapular plane.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to describe the biceps load test II for evaluating the superior labral anterior and posterior (SLAP) lesions. TYPE OF STUDY: This is a double-blind study in consecutive data, which includes diagnostic accuracy of a test using sensitivity, specificity, and interexaminer reliability. METHODS: In the supine position, the arm is elevated to 120 degrees and externally rotated to its maximal point, with the elbow in the 90 degrees flexion and the forearm in the supinated position. The patient is asked to flex the elbow while resisting the elbow flexion by the examiner. The test is considered positive if the patient complains of pain during the resisted elbow flexion. The test is negative if pain is not elicited or if the pre-existing pain during the elevation and external rotation of the arm is unchanged or diminished by the resisted elbow flexion. A prospective study was performed in 127 patients to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy for the biceps load test II. Two independent examiners were assigned to perform the new diagnostic test. The results of the tests were confirmed during the arthroscopic examination. RESULTS: A positive test result in 38 subjects correlated with a SLAP lesion in 35 patients and an intact biceps-superior labrum in 3 patients. A negative test result in 89 patients correlated with an intact superior labrum complex in 85 patients, whereas 4 patients with a negative test result had a type II SLAP lesion. The biceps load test II had a sensitivity of 89.7%, a specificity of 96.9%, a positive-predictive value of 92.1%, a negative-predictive value of 95.5%, and a kappa coefficient of 0.815. The abduction and external rotation of the shoulder during the test changes the relative direction of the biceps fiber in a position of oblique angle to the posterosuperior labrum. The resisted contraction of the biceps increases the pain generated on the superior labrum that is already peeled off the glenoid margin in the abducted and externally rotated position. CONCLUSIONS: The biceps load test II is an effective diagnostic test for SLAP lesions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use two commonly accepted measurement techniques to determine whether intense swimming exercise altered scapular position in male high school swimmers. Scapular position differences between dominant and nondominant shoulders were also investigated. DESIGN: A pilot study on 10 asymptomatic male volunteers established the reliability of the scapular position measurement techniques described by DiVeta and Kibler (intratester intraclass correlation coefficients 0.86-0.98). Scapular position was prospectively recorded before and after swimming practice just prior to tapering for championship competition. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty male high school swimmers from two local teams, ages 13 to 18 years. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects completed their usual 2-hour swimming practice at the peak of their training intensity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in scapular position preexercise versus postexercise. RESULTS: Scapular position did not change preexercise to postexercise for either the DiVeta (22.2 +/- 1.4 to 22.3 +/- 1.5 cm, p = 0.96) or Kibler (9.2 +/- 1.4 to 9.4 +/- 1.3 cm, p = 1.00) measures. Nondominant preexercise scapular position was generally more medial and moved laterally with exercise, becoming roughly equivalent to the dominant shoulder. CONCLUSION: The DiVeta and Kibler scapular position measurement techniques are acceptably reliable. However these techniques generally failed to demonstrate significant changes in scapular position after intense swimming exercise in the study population. Nondominant side scapulae typically moved laterally postexercise. These findings and implications are discussed.

AB  - Glenoid component loosening is the dominant cause of failure in total shoulder arthroplasty. It is presumed that loosening in the glenoid is caused by high stresses in the cement layer. Several anchorage systems have been designed with the aim of reducing the loosening rate, the two major categories being "keeled" fixation and "pegged" fixation. However, no three-dimensional finite element analysis has been performed to quantify the stresses in the cement or to compare the different glenoid prosthesis anchorage systems. The objective of this study was to determine the stresses in the cement layer and surrounding bone for glenoid replacement components. A three-dimensional model of the scapula was generated using CT data for geometry and material property definition. Keeled and pegged designs were inserted into the glenoid, surrounded by a 1-mm layer of bone cement. A 90 deg arm abduction load with a full muscle and joint load was applied, following van der Helm (1994). Deformations of the prosthesis, stresses in the cement, and stresses in the bone were calculated. Stresses were also calculated for a simulated case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in which bone properties were modified to reflect that condition. A maximum principal stress-based failure model was used to predict what quantity of the cement is at risk of failure at the levels of stress computed. The prediction is that 94 percent (pegged prosthesis) and 68 percent (keeled prosthesis) of the cement has a greater than 95 percent probability of survival in normal bone. In RA bone, however, the situation is reversed where 86 percent (pegged prosthesis) and 99 percent (keeled prosthesis) of the cement has a greater than 95 percent probability of survival. Bone stresses are shown to be not much affected by the prosthesis design, except at the tip of the central peg or keel. It is concluded that a "pegged" anchorage system is superior for normal bone, whereas a "keeled" anchorage system is superior for RA bone.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A bilateral comparison of strength and range of motion testing in professional baseball pitchers. OBJECTIVE: We studied 39 professional male baseball pitchers to determine if the shoulder used for throwing was weaker or had less passive range of motion, compared to the nondominant arm. BACKGROUND: Shoulder muscle weakness has been proposed as a possible risk factor for developing injury. Therefore, objective quantification of the strength of glenohumeral and scapular rotator muscle groups should be studied in a population of professional baseball pitchers. METHODS AND MEASURES: Passive internal and external range of motion was bilaterally measured at 90 degrees of abduction. Muscle strength of the following muscles was measured bilaterally with a hand-held dynamometer: external and internal glenohumeral rotators, supraspinatus, middle trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior. RESULTS: Passive external rotation of the glenohumeral joint at 90 degrees of abduction on the pitching side was significantly greater than on the nonpitching side. Passive internal rotation range of motion on the nonpitching side was significantly greater than on the pitching side. The pitching arm's internal rotators, when tested in abduction, were significantly stronger than the nonpitching arm. The nonpitching arm's external rotators in the plane of the scapula, and in abduction, were significantly greater than those of the pitching arm. The pitching arm's middle and lower trapezius muscles were significantly stronger than those of the nonpitching arm. CONCLUSION: The range of motion and strength characteristics measured in this study can assist clinicians in evaluating athletes who use overhead throwing motions.

AB  - Although numerical models on the shoulder complex joint are currently available, many are impractical because of the procedural complexity coupled with limited and mere simple simulations. The present study defined the clavicle-scapula system as the "base of the humerus" in determining the position of proximal head of humerus, rendering conclusive innovation of a six degree of freedom (DOF) shoulder complex joint model. Furthermore, a complete measurement system where evaluation by calibrating the actual values via the use of an electromagnetic tracking device (ETD) was developed based on the innovated model. The special calibration method using optimizing calculation to work out the rotational center of humerus was employed and actually tested if the theoretical consideration was practically available. As a result of accuracy check experiments, the measurement error was defined within 2-3 mm, indicating sufficient accuracy in studies for human movement. Our findings strongly advocate that the benefit of this novel measurement system would contribute to studies related to shoulder movements in physiological anthropology.

AB  - Within the framework of the current call for standardization in upper extremity research, three methods to determine the glenohumeral joint rotation centre in vivo were tested. Therefore, subjects performed humeral movements, while a 3D electromagnetic tracking device registered the motion of the humerus with respect to the scapula. For the first method to estimate the glenohumeral joint rotation centre five scapular bony landmarks served as input to regression equations. The second method fitted a sphere through the humeral position data and the third method calculated the rotation centre determining an optimal helical axis. The experiment consisted of two parts, at first one subject was measured 10 times, subsequently one observer measured 10 subjects twice and another observer measured these subjects once. The first part of the experiment demonstrated that all methods are capable to reproduce the rotation centre within 4mm, but the location of the centre differed significantly between methods (p<0.001). The second part, showed that inter- and intra-observer reliability was sufficiently for the sphere-fitting method and for the helical-axes method. The two observations of one observer differed significantly (p<0.008) using the regression method. The authors prefer the helical-axes method, it is a reliable and valid method which can be applied in movement registration of healthy subjects and patients with a shoulder endoprosthesis, it can be applied in hinge joints to determine a rotation axis instead of a rotation centre which is desirable in standardized upper extremity research, and calculation time is short.

AB  - To validate the assumption that the center of rotation in the glenohumeral (GH) joint can be described based on the geometry of the joint, two methods for calculation of the GH rotation center were compared. These are a kinematic estimation based on the calculation of instantaneous helical axes, and a geometric estimation based on a spherical fit through the surface of the glenoid. Four fresh cadaver arms were fixed at the scapula and fitted with electromagnetic sensors. Each arm was moved in different directions while at the same time the orientation of the humerus was recorded. Subsequently, each specimen was dissected and its glenoid and humeral head surfaces were digitized. Results indicate no differences between the methods. It is concluded that the method to estimate the GH center of rotation as the center of a sphere through the glenoid surface, with the radius of the humeral head, appears to be valid.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of a recently described method of measuring shoulder rotational range of motion in which the scapula is manually stabilized, and to determine the reliability of that technique compared with measurements taken with the scapula unstabilized. DESIGN: Fifty high school athletes underwent measurement of shoulder rotational range of motion with and without the scapula manually stabilized. Measurements were performed by two groups of physical therapists blinded to the movement results, with repeat measurements performed 5 days later. RESULTS: Rotational motion measured with the scapula stabilized was significantly less than when it was measured with the scapula unstabilized. Reliability was comparable for the two techniques when measuring external rotation, but the new technique was more reliable for measuring internal rotation. CONCLUSION: Scapular stabilization should be used when measuring internal rotation of the shoulder to obtain more accurate measurement of pure glenohumeral rotation. The technique described is promising, but warrants further refinement before it can be recommended for widespread clinical use. With practice, in experienced clinicians' hands, this technique may be the most reliable method for measuring outcome in clinical trials and for following clinically significant rotational motion deficits.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a relationship between altered scapular plane glenohumeral kinematics end shoulder pain. Subjects were divided into 3 groups: normal volunteers (n = 10), patients with symptomatic rotator cuff tears severe enough to warrant surgery (n = 10), and subjects with no symptoms who had tears documented on magnetic resonance imaging and normal examination (n = 10). Humeral kinematics were observed with a computer-enhanced modification of the Poppen and Walker technique. Scapular plane x-ray films were obtained at 0 degree, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees, and 150 degrees of elevation. Measurements were made by 3 independent observers blinded to the diagnosis, and data interpretation was performed based on mean values for independent observers. Results showed a high degree of interobserver and intraobserver reliability (coefficients = 0.96 and 0.95, respectively). The symptomatic and asymptomatic groups showed progressive superior translation of the humeral head on the glenoid with increasing arm elevation. The normal group, in contrast, maintained a constant center of rotation along the geometric center of the glenoid. Symptomatic and asymptomatic rotator cuff tear groups showed superior head migration from 30 degrees to 150 degrees, which was significantly different from those seen in the normal group. No significant difference between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups was demonstrated with the small numbers used in this study. The presence of a rotator cuff tear was associated in a disruption of normal glenohumeral kinematics in the scapular plane. Because significant superior migration of the humeral head was seen in both the asymptomatic and symptomatic rotator cuff groups, painless and normal shoulder motion is possible in the presence of abnormal glenohumeral kinematics. Abnormal glenohumeral kinematics alone was not an independent factor, which could explain the occurrence of symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a method to obtain accurate three-dimensional scapular attitudes and to assess their concurrent validity and reliability. STUDY DESIGN: In this methodological study, the three-dimensional scapular attitudes were calculated in degrees, using a rotation matrix (cyclic Cardanic sequence), from spatial coordinates obtained with the probing of three non colinear landmarks first on an anatomical model and second on a healthy subject. BACKGROUND: Although abnormal movement of the scapula is related to shoulder impingement syndrome, it is not clearly understood whether or not scapular motion impairment is a predisposing factor. Characterization of three-dimensional scapular attitudes in planes and at joint angles for which sub-acromial impingement is more likely to occur is not known. METHODS: The Optotrak probing system was used. An anatomical model of the scapula was built and allowed us to impose scapular attitudes of known direction and magnitude. A local coordinate reference system was defined with three non colinear anatomical landmarks to assess accuracy and concurrent validity of the probing method with fixed markers. Axial rotation angles were calculated from a rotation matrix using a cyclic Cardanic sequence of rotations. The same three non colinear body landmarks were digitized on one healthy subject and the three dimensional scapular attitudes obtained were compared between sessions in order to assess the reliability. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The measure of three dimensional scapular attitudes calculated from data using the Optotrak probing system was accurate with means of the differences between imposed and calculated rotation angles ranging from 1.5 degrees to 4.2 degrees. Greatest variations were observed around the third axis of the Cardanic sequence associated with posterior-anterior transverse rotations. The mean difference between the Optotrak probing system method and fixed markers was 1.73 degrees showing a good concurrent validity. Differences between the two methods were generally very low for one and two direction displacements and the largest discrepancies were observed for imposed displacements combining movement about the three axes. The between sessions variation of three dimensional scapular attitudes was less than 10% for most of the arm positions adopted by a healthy subject suggesting a good reliability. The Optotrak probing system used with a standardized protocol lead to accurate, valid and reliable measures of scapular attitudes. RELEVANCE: Although abnormal range of motion of the scapula is often related to shoulder pathologies, reliable outcome measures to quantify three-dimensional scapular motion on subjects are not available. It is important to establish a standardized protocol to characterize three-dimensional scapular motion on subjects using a method for which the accuracy and validity are known. The method used in the present study has provided such a protocol and will now allow to verify to what extent, scapular motion impairment is linked to the development of specific shoulder pathologies.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that abnormal rotation of the scapula is associated with shoulder pathology. Among the methods which have been proposed, planar x-ray measurements are probably the only methods, which enable clinicians to assess accurately and objectively the scapulohumeral function in vivo. The aim of this study was to develop a method for the assessment of scapulohumeral kinematics using digital fluoroscopy. Anteroposterior images of the right glenohumeral joint were taken, in thirty-four healthy males, with the arm at rest, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees, 150 degrees and maximum abduction, in the scapular plane. High inter- and intra-examiner reliability was observed regarding the arm and scapular angle measurements (ICC = 0.92-0.99). The positioning of the arm at the proposed angles was also highly accurate (< 2.3 degrees misplacement) and reproducible (CV% < 5.3%). The mean radiation dose was 0.075 mSv (+/- 0.027 mSv). At the resting position the scapula was in slight downward rotation (-2.4 degrees +/- 4.3 degrees) and the arm in slight abduction (1.5 degrees +/- 6.6 degrees). The mean maximum scapular rotation and the mean maximum arm abduction was 61.4 degrees (+/- 5.2 degrees) and 162.4 degrees (+/- 6.6 degrees) respectively. A curvilinear relationship was found between the arm angle (AA) and the scapular angle (SA) (p < 0.0001). The AA:SA ratio for the entire range of abduction was 2.5:1. The greatest contribution of the scapula (1.7:1) achieved at 30 degrees-60 degrees of arm. The high accuracy and reliability of our method and the low radiation recordings suggests that digital fluoroscopy may be considered for further investigation of the scapulohumeral kinematics in both healthy and pathological shoulders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reliability and discriminative ability of a test battery consisting of 7 tests designed for the assessment of functional limitations in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). METHODS: The intrarater reliability of the test battery was evaluated for 15 women with FMS. Interrater reliability was calculated on 4 tests separately. Fifteen healthy women constituted a reference group. RESULTS: The intrarater coefficient of variation was < 8% for the shoulder range of motion tests, chair test, and 6-minute walk test, and < 21% for the shoulder endurance test, with correlation coefficients above 0.80 for all tests. Kappa was 0.70-0.80 for the hand-to-scapula tests. The interrater coefficient of variation was < 5% for shoulder range of motion. The performances of the FMS patients were significantly decreased in comparison with healthy subjects in all the tests except for the hand-to-scapula movement. CONCLUSIONS: All but 1 of the selected 7 tests were considered to possess acceptable intrarater reliability for use in FMS in clinical physical therapy practice.

AB  - This paper presents some results on the modelling and the corresponding parameter estimation of the human shoulder. This system consists of the clavicle, the scapula, the humerus and the various joints between these bodies and the trunk through the sternum; it will be represented as a succession of a rotational joint between the sternum and the clavicle and a constant distance joint, representing the scapula between, the clavicle and the humerus head. The parameters of this system are the components of the position vectors of the joint characteristic points (the corresponding centres of the rotations). Experimental results are presented as well as a validation of the proposed model.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively evaluate the effects of commonly used shoulder exercises on shoulder kinematics and resting posture. STUDY DESIGN: A repeated-measures design was used with measurements performed before and after a 6-week exercise program. METHOD: Twenty asymptomatic subjects with forward shoulder posture were recruited. Stretching exercises for the pectoral muscles and resisted strengthening exercises for the scapular retractors and elevators and the glenohumeral abductors and external rotators were performed three times per week for 6 weeks. A three-dimensional electromechanical digitizer was used to measure thoracic inclination and scapular orientation and position. These measurements were taken with the arm (1) at the side, (2) abducted to 90 degrees, and (3) at maximal abduction. The isometric force of glenohumeral external and internal rotation and horizontal abduction and adduction were measured with a hand-held dynamometer. All subjects were tested before and after the 6-week exercise program. Hotelling's T2 and paired t tests were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The strength of horizontal abduction and internal and external rotation increased after exercise (p < .01). The anterior inclination of the thoracic spine decreased, and the glenohumeral contribution to arm elevation increased (p < .01). Resting scapular posture did not change. As the arm was abducted to 90 degrees, the scapula showed less upward rotation and less superior translation after the exercise program (p < .01). CONCLUSION: The exercise program improved muscle strength, produced a more erect upper trunk posture, increased scapular stability, and altered scapulohumeral rhythm.

AB  - In this paper the applicability in terms of measurement accuracy of the "Flock of Birds" six D.O.F. electromagnetic tracking device in shoulder research is investigated. Position measurements in a workspace of approximately 1 m3 were performed using a stylus. The andom error at the stylus tip appeared to be 1.86, 1.98 and 2.54 mm for x-, y- and z-coordinate, respectively. The error caused by distortion of the magnetic field by metal in the concrete of especially the floor was 20.8, 22.2 and 20.4 mm for the x-, y- and z-coordinate, respectively. Calibration and leaving out the measurements closest to the floor lowered this error to 2.07, 2.38 and 2.35 mm. Orientation errors of the shoulder bones evolving from the measurement inaccuracy were estimated from repeated measurements of shoulder bony landmarks of ten subjects by means of the stylus. These errors were generally below 2 degrees. This is lower than found for the same measurements using a spatial linkage digitizer. It is concluded that the "Flock of Birds" is a useful tool for shoulder kinematic studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to illustrate the low accuracy of two-dimensional (2-D) X-ray projection methods for the quantification of the three-dimensional (3-D) shoulder motions. BACKGROUND: The traditional method for the quantification of the gleno-humeral motion is by means of 2-D X-ray recording. The motion was characterized by the scapulo-humeral rhythm: the ratio of the nett humeral elevation over nett scapular rotation. The method was based on the quantification of the planar projection of the spatial positions of X-ray dense structures of the scapula. The deformations introduced by the central projection method, a feature of X-ray projection, cannot be compensated for by calibration: the position of the scapula with respect to the camera setting is unknown, and skeletal landmarks of the scapula cannot uniquely be identified. The transformation from 3-D orientations to 2-D angles will, therefore, be inaccurate. METHODS: A 2-D X-ray projection of the scapula during a typical arm abduction was simulated. The 3-D motion was obtained by means of palpation and subsequent digitization of skeletal landmarks of the scapula. The 3-D positions of the recorded landmarks were projected on a plane by a simulation based on the parameters of the X-ray equipment. The scapulo-humeral rhythm was calculated for the different scapular landmarks, and for the orientation of the subject with respect to the projection axis. The results were compared with previous published scapulo-humeral rhythms. RESULTS: The scapulo-humeral rhythm depends both on the choice of the skeletal landmarks, used to quantify the scapular rotations, and on the orientation of the subject in the X-ray setting. The full range of results obtained from earlier published experiments could be obtained from a simulation based on a single 3-D arm abduction. CONCLUSIONS: The 2-D scapulo-humeral rhythm, obtained from planar X-ray projection, is an inaccurate parameter to define the scapular motions. RELEVANCE: The 2-D scapulo-humeral rhythm is an insensitive parameter to identify clinical disorders in the gleno-humeral motions, 3-D motion recording should be applied. Only when stringent precautions are taken with respect to repeatability of positioning of the subjects, can the method be used to study intra-individual effects, e.g., the follow-up of patients during treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To validate a system, using electromagnetic movement sensors, for the simultaneous measurement of scapular and humeral positions. DESIGN: The study was designed to analyse the repeatability and to quantify the inherent measurement errors, using two observers to measure the movements of five normal subjects. BACKGROUND: Following an earlier study of a system to measure three dimensional scapula motion, the method has been developed to incorporate simultaneous measurement of humeral and scapular position using a new design of scapula locator and a two-channel measurement system. METHODS: The system was used to measure the scapula movements accompanying abduction of the shoulder. The scapula locator was applied at 10 degrees intervals of abduction. This was measured initially using a fluid filled goniometer, but, in a second part of the study, using an additional motion sensor. RESULTS: In the single channel study, the 95% confidence intervals were less than 4 degrees and 10 mm. When simultaneous measurement of arm position was performed the confidence intervals were little changed. CONCLUSIONS: A new system for the measurement of scapulohumeral relationships has been shown to have good inter-and intraobserver reliability. This study opens the way for a full investigation of the scapula motion accompanying three dimensional shoulder motion in both normal subjects and in patients having shoulder pathology.

AB  - In this paper, a method is described for in vivo prediction of the glenohumeral joint rotation center (GH-r), necessary for the construction of a humerus local coordinate system in shoulder kinematic studies. The three-dimensional positions of five scapula bony landmarks as well as a large number of data points on the surface of the glenoid and humeral head were collected at 36 sets of cadaver scapulae and adjacent humeri. The position of GH-r in each scapula was estimated by mathematically fitting spheres to the glenoid and humeral head. GH-r prediction from scapula geometry parameters by linear regression resulted in a RMSE between measured and predicted GH-r of 2.32 mm for the x-coordinate, 2.69 mm for the y-coordinate and 3.04 mm for the z-coordinate. Application in vivo revealed a random humerus orientation error due to measurement inaccuracies of 1.35, 0.29 and 1.26 degrees standard deviation per rotation angle. The estimated total humerus orientation error including the offset error due to the regression model inaccuracy was 2.86, 0.84 and 2.69 degrees standard deviation. As these errors were about 15 and 20% of, respectively, the intra- and inter-subject variability of the humerus orientations measured, it is concluded that the method described in this paper allows for an adequate construction of a humerus local coordinate system.

AB  - Few studies have evaluated computed tomography in glenohumeral osteoarthritis without humeral head elevation. Two recent studies included only ten and 11 patients, respectively. We evaluated computed tomography findings in 113 cases of primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis without humeral head elevation. Glenoid retroversion was substantially increased, with a mean of 16 degrees versus 8 degrees in a control group. The method used to measure this parameter was reproducible, with a mean interobserver variability of 4 degrees for a 95% confidence interval (P < or = 0.05). Humeral retrotorsion was apparently decreased (8 degrees), but osteoarthritis-related changes in the humeral head resulted in substantial measurement errors (interobserver variability, 11 degrees for a 95% confidence interval; P < or = 0.05). Humeral head subluxation was found in 35% of cases and measurement of this parameter was reproducible (interobserver variability, 4 degrees for a 95% confidence interval). Changes in the glenoid over time were dependent on the position of the humeral head in the glenoid fossa, which classified the shape of the glenoid with satisfactory reproducibility (intra- and interobserver Kappa, 0.68). The subscapularis and infraspinatus muscles were normal (stage 0 or 1) in 98% and 91% of cases, respectively and the method of Goutallier and Bernageau used for muscle evaluation proved highly reproducible (Kappa, 0.85). Computed tomography is invaluable for planning surgical treatment for primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis without humeral head elevation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize the scapulohumeral rhythm in the normal shoulder during dynamic elevation of the arm in the scapular plane and to compare the scapulohumeral rhythm during three different states of loading: 1) arm completely unloaded and passively elevated, 2) light load consisting of active elevation against the weight of the limb, and 3) heavy loading against maximal resistance. Electromagnetic tracking was used to record three-dimensional scapular and humeral kinematics on 25 normal subjects. Cardan angles were calculated to assess the dynamic relationship of humeral elevation to scapular upward rotation. The results show that during dynamic humeral elevation the scapulohumeral rhythm changes depending on the phase of elevation and the external load on the arm. During passive range of motion, the scapulohumeral rhythm decreased from 7.9:1 to 2.1:1 as the arm was elevated. Light shoulder loads caused an increase of the scapulohumeral rhythm from 3.1:1 to 4.3:1 as the arm was elevated. Heavy shoulder loading resulted in an increasing scapulohumeral rhythm from 1.9:1 to 4.5:1 as the arm was elevated. The results suggest that the historical assumption of a simple linear 2:1 scapulohumeral rhythm ratio may be overly simplistic and may not accurately describe the scapulohumeral rhythm under varying dynamic conditions. Therapists need to understand the normal changing relationships of the scapulohumeral rhythm under different conditions for accurate interpretation of clinical observations.

AB  - The inability to perform the "liftoff" test has been attributed to a subscapularis muscle or tendon injury. The goals of this study were to evaluate the activity of the glenohumeral muscles during performance of the "liftoff" maneuver and to identify the most effective initial upper extremity placement that isolates the subscapularis musculotendinous unit. In the first phase of this study 15 subjects accomplished four proposed versions to the "liftoff" test while their intramuscular electromyographic activity in select glenohumeral muscles was recorded. The second phase of this study assessed the ability of five subjects with a nonfunctional subscapularis musculotendinous unit to perform the same proposed versions. On the basis of electromyographic data none of the proposed versions to the "liftoff" maneuver isolated the upper and lower subscapularis muscle from either the teres major, latissimus dorsi, posterior deltoid, or rhomboid muscles (p > 0.05). In the presence of a nonfunctional subscapularis musculotendinous unit, the subjects were able to perform all of the proposed versions of the "liftoff" maneuver except one: elevation of the dorsum of the hand from the posterior-inferior border of the scapula (maximum internal rotation test). Although significant electromyographic activity was generated in the potentially confounding shoulder girdle muscles during the maximum internal rotation "liftoff" test, a successful test appears to be dependent on the isolated glenohumeral internal rotation function of the subscapularis muscle.

AB  - Contemporary shoulder rehabilitation programs emphasize scapular control in the treatment of shoulder pathology. In addition, scapular winging and scapular tipping are often cited as key components to both the evaluative and rehabilitative phase of treatment. However, the lack of objective measurement procedures makes clinical evaluation of these phenomena difficult. The purpose of this project was to develop a reliable technique to quantify posterior scapular displacement (direction of scapular movement for winging and/or tipping). Forty healthy subjects (21 males, 19 females) who reported no current shoulder pain participated in this study. A measurement instrument was designed to quantify, to the nearest whole degree of motion, the posterior displacement of the inferior angle of the scapula from the posterior thorax. Subjects' scapulae were each measured two times without holding weight (unweighted position) and two times while the subjects held 10% of their body weight (weighted position). During all trials, two testers were blinded from the measurement readings. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated based on a repeated measure analysis of variance to determine intertester and intratester reliability. The standard error of measurement (SEM) was used to determine the measurement error. Intratester within-day reliability ICCs ranged from 0.97 to 0.98, and SEM ranged from 0.6 to 1.1 degrees. Intertester within-day reliability ICCs ranged from 0.92 to 0.97, and SEM ranged between 1.1 and 1.7 degrees. None of the calculated p values for intratester and intertester reliability were statistically significant (p < 0.05). We conclude that this measurement technique is a reliable method to quantify posterior scapular displacement. Further research utilizing this measurement technique is recommended.

AB  - UNLABELLED: A study was undertaken to investigate the precision of plain radiographs in the assessment of the width of radiolucent lines and to define parameters for more accurate measurement. A metal-backed glenoid component was inserted into fourteen cadaveric scapulae; the component had a radiolucent spacer at the central post to provide a gap with a known width at the component-bone interface. The specimens were mounted in a custom-designed jig, and initial radiographs were made with the glenoid in neutral version; sequential radiographs then were made, at 5-degree intervals, with the glenoid in 0 to 40 degrees of anteversion and retroversion. Four independent observers with various levels of experience measured the width of the radiolucent lines with use of digital microcalipers. Osteometric analysis demonstrated that normal glenoid version ranged from 3 degrees of anteversion to 13 degrees of retroversion; these values were similar to those reported in previous studies. Radiographic analysis showed that accurate measurement of the width of the gap was dependent on the position of the glenoid. The measured widths of the radiolucent lines were significantly smaller than the known width of the gap when retroversion was 10 degrees or more and when anteversion was 15 degrees or more (p < or = 0.05). Radiolucent lines were not consistently observed on radiographs that were made with the glenoid in more than 20 degrees of anteversion and retroversion. An analysis of interobserver error showed close agreement among the measurements made by the different observers when the glenoid was in 0 and 5 degrees of rotation, with decreased agreement when the glenoid was rotated more than 10 degrees from neutral. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Inaccurate positioning of the patient and anatomical variation in glenoid version may explain the variability in the reported onsets, progressions, and frequencies of radiographic loosening of glenoid components. The findings of the present study also may help to explain the poor association between clinical and radiographic findings reported for patients who have pain at the site of a total shoulder prosthesis. Radiographs made within 10 degrees of neutral should allow accurate assessment of radiolucent lines about the glenoid.

AB  - The electromyographic activity of eight muscles of the rotator cuff and shoulder girdle (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, pectoralis, latissimus dorsi, and the anterior, middle, and posterior deltoid) was measured from the nondominant shoulders of 11 subjects during a series of 29 isometric contractions. The contractions simulated different positions used for strength testing of the rotator cuff and involved elevation, external rotation, and internal rotation at three degrees of initial humeral rotation (-45 degrees of internal rotation, 0 degree, +45 degrees of external rotation) and scapular elevation (0 degree, 45 degrees, 90 degrees). Isolation of the supraspinatus muscle was best achieved with the test position of elevation at 90 degrees of scapular elevation and +45 degrees (external rotation) of humeral rotation. Isolation of the infraspinatus muscle was best achieved with external rotation at 0 degree of scapular elevation and -45 degrees (internal rotation) of humeral rotation. Isolation of the subscapularis muscle was best achieved with the Gerber push-off test. This study used four criteria for identifying the optimal manual muscle test for each rotator cuff muscle: 1) maximal activation of the cuff muscle, 2) minimal contribution from involved shoulder synergists, 3) minimal provocation of pain, and 4) good test-retest reliability. Based on the results of this study and known painful arcs of motion, an objective identification of the optimal tests for the manual muscle testing of the cuff was elucidated.

AB  - Internal rotation of the shoulder is frequently measured by noting the maximal vertebral level reached by the patient's thumb, but it is not at all certain that this maneuver is strictly measuring internal rotation. We analyzed this maneuver with computed tomographic scans of the shoulder in differing positions. We also analyzed extension of the glenohumeral joint and scapulothoracic articulation with scapular lateral radiographs. Finally, we used posteroanterior radiographs to analyze elbow flexion at the limits of internal rotation behind the back. We found that maximal internal rotation behind the back occurs in approximately a 2 : 1 ratio between the glenohumeral joint and the scapulothoracic articulation. However, the scapulothoracic articulation was more significant in placing the arm behind the back, whereas the glenohumeral joint performed most of the internal rotation in front of the body. The scapulothoracic articulation assists in this motion by both extension and internal rotation of the scapula on the thorax. The limits of internal rotation behind the back are reached with a significant contribution from elbow flexion. We conclude that measuring shoulder internal rotation by the maximal vertebral level reached by the patient's thumb greatly oversimplifies the concept of internal rotation and that limitations in this motion may not be strictly due to a loss of internal rotation at the glenohumeral joint.

AB  - A method for directly measuring the position of the humeral head on the face of the glenoid in different positions of abduction of the arm was developed. We studied three subject groups: 12 patients with normal shoulders (group 1), 15 patients with stage II impingement syndrome (group 2), and 20 patients with rotator cuff tears or stage III impingement (group 3). The study consisted of a series of anteroposterior roentgenograms in the plane of the scapula with the arm in neutral rotation. Roentgenograms were obtained at 20 degrees intervals as the arm was elevated in the plane of the scapula from 0 degree to 120 degrees. Patients held a weight equal to 2 1/2% of body weight in the hand. The parameters measured were excursion of the humeral head on the glenoid face, expressed as the distance that the center of the head lies above or below the center of the glenoid, arm angle, scapulothoracic angle, and glenohumeral angle. For patients with normal shoulders (group 1), there was no significant change in position of the humeral head with arm elevation. In contrast, those with stage II impingement (group 2) had significant (p < 0.05) superior displacement of the center of the humeral head with arm elevation. Patients with rotator cuff tears (group 3) demonstrated a significant rise (p < 0.05) during the first 40 degrees of abduction. The average position of the humeral head in the two pathologic patient groups was superior (p < 0.05) to the average head position in the normal patient group. There was no significant difference in head position between patients with stage II impingement and patients with rotator cuff tear. The ratio of the glenohumeral angle to the scapulothoracic angle during abduction was calculated for our patient groups. In both patient groups, arm abduction had a larger scapulothoracic component than for normal shoulders. The superior migration of the humeral head is a probable result of cuff failure, either partial or complete.

AB  - We conducted this cadaveric study to define a biomechanical rationale for rotator cuff function in several deficiency states. A dynamic shoulder testing apparatus was used to examine change in middle deltoid muscle force and humeral translation associated with simulated rotator cuff tendon paralyses and various sizes of rotator cuff tears. Supraspinatus paralysis resulted in a significant increase (101%) in the middle deltoid force required to initiate abduction. This increase diminished to only 12% for full glenohumeral abduction. The glenohumeral joint maintained ball-and-socket kinematics during glenohumeral abduction in the scapular plane with an intact rotator cuff. No significant alterations in humeral translation occurred with a simulated supraspinatus paralysis, nor with 1-, 3-, and 5-cm rotator cuff tears, provided the infraspinatus tendon was functional. Global tears resulted in an inability to elevate beyond 25 degrees of glenohumeral abduction despite a threefold increase in middle deltoid force. These results validated the importance of the supraspinatus tendon during the initiation of abduction. Glenohumeral joint motion was not affected when the "transverse force couple" (subscapularis, infraspinatus, and teres minor tendons) remained intact. Significant changes in glenohumeral joint motion occurred only if paralysis or anatomic deficiency violated this force couple. Finally, this model confirmed that rotator cuff disease treatment must address function in addition to anatomy.

AB  - Arthroscopic treatment was performed on 71 patients with recurrent shoulder dislocations; all of the patients had monoplanar anterior instability attributable to arthroscopically diagnosed Bankart lesion. Of the 71 operations, 29 were performed using the original Caspari technique (follow-up, 59 months), and 42 were performed after modifications made in the original technique (follow-up, 38 months), notably improved preparation of the capsular reinsertion zone and increase in the number of monofilament points and their anchorage directly to the bone, on the spine of the scapula. We compared the results obtained in these two differently treated groups, taking into account several factors in the patient's history and clinical condition. These included the number of dislocation episodes before the operation, as well as clinical findings regarding stability, movement, function and pain (Rowe scale score), contralateral shoulder laxity, level of preoperative versus postoperative athletic activity, and postoperative recurrence rate. In the Caspari-treated group, we obtained 66% satisfactory results compared with the 90% obtained in the second group. The recurrence rate was 27% in the first group compared with 4.8% in the second group. These data were statistically significant. No correlation was found between preoperative number of dislocations and recurrence rate, nor for contralateral shoulder laxity. No significant difference was found regarding resumption of sport activity in the two groups. Our data indicate that, with accuracy in patient selection and effective surgical technique, the recurrence rate can be reduced, and results similar to those of the arthrotomic technique may be obtained.

AB  - Smooth motion of the scapula and humerus with respect to the thorax is essential for shoulder function and abnormalities may indicate clinical entities. Recent studies have made an attempt to devise simple, practical means of quantifying scapular position. The aim of this study was to examine the intra-tester and inter-tester reliability of two methods and to determine if significant differences existed between the dominant versus non-dominant extremity. Seventeen healthy volunteers (4 M; 13 F) were examined by two testers. The tape measurements consisted of the classic methods of Kibler and DiVeta in three sitting postures, expanded by the measurement of the linear distance from the medial border to the thoracic mid-line, and the scapular size measure. The SAS software package was used for data analysis. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) intra-tester reliability ranged between 0.96-0.8 for both methods without significant differences, whereas the ICC for inter-tester reliability ranged between 0.42-0.9 with higher values (moderate and good) for the Kibler technique. In the additional tests high values were also obtained for ICC intra-tester, except for the measurements of the linear distance of the medial border of the scapula to the thoracic mid-line and the distance of the inferior process of the acromion to the third vertebra, both in 90 degrees abduction and internal rotation. The ICC for inter-tester was only acceptable for the DiVeta measurement on 45 degrees abduction. Significant differences were noted between both testers on the following measures: Kibler in 45 degrees abduction, DiVeta in 45 degrees abduction and 90 degrees abduction and the scapular size measure. The comparison of dominant versus non-dominant extremity revealed larger but not significantly different means for the dominant extremity in the classic methods. Significant differences occurred for Tester 1 in the measurement of the distance of the medial border to the thoracic mid-line and Tester 2 in DiVita in 45 degrees abduction. The SEM values never exceeded 1 cm. We believe that the Kibler technique holds promise for further studies, has the advantage of measuring in three positions and with some familiarisation can be reliable. Further research is necessary in patients with pathological conditions.

AB  - A three-dimensional biomechanical model of the shoulder is developed for force predictions in 46 shoulder structures. The model is directed towards the analysis of static working situations where the load is low or moderate. Arbitrary static arm postures in the natural shoulder range may be considered, as well as different kinds of external loads including different force and moment directions. The model can predict internal forces for the shoulder muscles, for the glenohumeral, the acromioclavicular and the sternoclavicular joint as well as for the coracohumeral ligament. A solution to the statistically indeterminate force system is obtained by minimising an objective function. The default function chosen for this is the sum of the squared muscle stresses, but other objective functions may be used as well. The structure of the model is described and its ingredients discussed. The internal consistency of the model, its structural stability and the compatibility of the elements that go into it, is investigated.

AB  - Assessment of posture is an integral component of patient evaluation with shoulder overuse injuries. However, the professional literature contains relatively few studies that have assessed the relationship between posture, function, and injury. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship and differences in postural variables within and between subjects with overuse injuries to the shoulder of healthy subjects. Thirty patient subjects and 30 healthy subjects matched for age and gender were recruited. Scapular protraction and rotation, forward head position, midthoracic curvature, and passive humeral elevation in the plane of the scapula were measured randomly in standing. All measurement techniques were standardized and validated. Intrarater and interrater reliability for all clinical measures were established before data collection. Forward head position was significantly greater (p < .001) in the patient group than the healthy group; humeral elevation was significantly greater (p < .001) in the healthy group than in the patient group and in the uninvolved shoulders (p < .01) than the involved shoulders within the patient group. Scapular protraction, rotation, midthoracic curvature, and scapular symmetry were not significantly different between groups. Scapula protraction and rotation were significantly related (p < .05) in the patient group. No other postural variables were related. Conclusions regarding the influence of posture to shoulder injury are inconclusive based on several confounding variables that may have affected the outcome.

AB  - A measurement technique is presented for recording positions of the bones of the shoulder mechanism, i.e., thorax, clavicula, scapula and humerus, in 3-D space, based on palpating and recording positions of bony landmarks. The palpation technique implies that only static positions can be measured. Accuracy of retrieving bony landmarks is checked on-line using rigid body assumptions. The measurement error is calculated afterwards and is comparable with cinegraphic methods. Axial rotation of the clavicula is estimated by minimizing rotations in the acromioclavicular joint. A number of motion definitions is compared by means of interindividual variation and subjective interpretability. Two useful definitions are proposed for describing motions of the shoulder mechanism. Four conditions have been recorded: abduction and anteflexion of the humerus both with and without additional weight in the hand. Abduction and anteflexion result in large differences in scapular and clavicular motions. The effect of additional weight in the hand on the position of the shoulder girdle is negligible.

AB  - Our purpose was to determine the intratester and intertester reliability of measurements of both scapular and glenohumeral rotation during active arm elevation in the scapular plane with a new device, the scapulohumeral goniometer (SHG). Ten physical therapists, with 1 to 29 years of clinical experience, obtained repeated measurements on 45 subjects who were 27 to 82 years old. All subjects were tested in a uniform standing position with the handheld SHG, which was positioned over the subject's scapula and posterior shoulder according to operationally defined landmarks. For both scapular and glenohumeral rotation, 50% of the time the first and second measurements made on a patient by the same physical therapist differed by 3 degrees or more. Ten percent of the time, these measurements differed by 8 degrees or more. Measurements of active range of movement of scapular and glenohumeral rotation made by the same physical therapist during arm elevation in the scapular plane are clinically unacceptable when obtained with the current techniques for positioning the SHG. Clinical decisions based on results of active scapular and humeral motion in the scapular plane as measured on a patient by the same therapist with an SHG should be made with caution, because of the variability associated with this procedure.

AB  - Shoulder soft tissues echographic evaluation depends on the availability of well established echographic diagnostic criteria, which hasn't been fully accepted until nowadays, as results in that field have been controversial. The main purpose of the present study has been to determine the echographic criteria of the most frequent shoulder periarticular soft tissue pathology. A prospective study has been carried out, comparing the right to the left shoulder of 37 normals in order to determine the normal characteristics and limits of the selected echographic parameters (echogenicity, echostructure, dimensions in terms of width, rhythm of movement and rotator cuff competence ratio). Afterwards, the relative role of these variables in the identification of three different nosological groups determined through suitable gold standard diagnostic methods (36 suprasinatus tears, 20 supraspinatus tendinitis and 22 subacromial bursitis) has been determined. Lastly, the discriminant power of some echographic parameters association was tested, thus suggesting the echographic criteria to be selected. Results support the following criteria: 1) supraspinatus tears: cuff competence ratio less than 1, the difference value between the affected and the sound tendon thickness less than -1,8 mm associated with asymmetries of one of the remaining parameters (echogenicity, echostructure or rhythm); 2) supraspinatus tendinitis: the difference between the affected and the sound tendon thickness bigger than 1 mm associated with asymmetries of one of the remaining parameters (echogenicity, echostructure or rhythm); cuff competence ratio equal or above 1;3) subacromial bursitis: the difference between the affected and the sound bursa thickness bigger than 1 mm associated with asymmetries of one of the following parametres: echogenicity, echostruture or rhythm.

AB  - Advances in isokinetic technology allow the physical therapist to assess concentric, eccentric, and isometric muscle performance at the shoulder in various positions. Research is limited, however, on the reliability of isokinetic measurements. The purposes of this study were: 1) to determine the test-retest reliability of concentric, eccentric, and isometric muscle performance measurements of shoulder external and internal rotation in the scapular plane test position and 2) to compare this reliability between the involved and uninvolved limb of subjects with a history of unilateral shoulder pathology. Fourteen males and 10 females (17-58 years) were tested on two occasions at 1-week intervals with the Biodex isokinetic dynamometer. Peak torque, total work, and average power were recorded for concentric tests at angular velocities of 60 and 120 degrees/sec and for eccentric tests at 60 degrees/sec. Maximum average isometric torque was recorded in two positions. Means, standard deviations, and mean differences between sessions with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to determine test-retest reliability. Isometric tests were generally most reliable (ICC = .81-.93), followed by concentric (ICC = .60-.95) and eccentric tests (ICC = .44-.92). Isokinetic and isometric reliability were usually higher for involved than uninvolved shoulders. The implication of these findings is that there appears to be greater variability with eccentric than concentric or isometric testing of shoulder rotation. Factors that possibly contributed to variability are discussed. Clinicians should recognize potential sources of testing error when obtaining isokinetic measurements for use in clinical decision-making. Further refinement of isokinetic testing protocols at the shoulder is recommended.

AB  - We studied the value of dynamic sonography in adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder joint in patients with clinically suspected frozen shoulder. The sonographic criterion of adhesive capsulitis was continuous limitation of the sliding movement of the supraspinatus tendon against the acromion of the scapula. Arthrography was regarded as a gold standard in the diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis against which the sonographic results were compared. Among 23 patients with arthrographically documented adhesive capsulitis, sonographic examination showed limitation of movement of the supraspinatus tendon in 21. This sonographic sign therefore has a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy of 92% for detecting adhesive capsulitis, making dynamic sonography a reliable technique for the diagnosis of this condition.

AB  - Many disorders of the shoulder complex are accompanied by changes in the pattern of scapular motion which is difficult to measure except radiographically. In order to study the three-dimensional motion of the scapula which accompanies arm movements, a technique has been developed using a three-pointed locater which can be applied over three bony landmarks - the acromial angle, the inferior angle, and the root of the scapular spine. The spatial orientation of the locater relative to the trunk was measured using an electromagnetic movement sensor (isotrak) which has been shown to be clinically reliable. Measurements of scapular plane rotations during abduction showed particularly good agreement with published data; variations in measurements of the out-of-plane angles were attributed to difficulties of contacting the acromion reliably when the deltoid muscle was contracted. It is concluded that the system is suitable for clinical use in the study of shoulder pathology.

AB  - The strength of active external rotation and of abduction of the shoulder when the humerus was in the plane of the scapula (30 degrees of horizontal flexion anterior to the coronal plane) was measured isokinetically and isometrically in thirty-nine normal volunteers, who were stratified by age and sex. The angles at which peak torque was produced were similar when tested isokinetically and isometrically; these angles were similar for external rotation (at 60 and 30 degrees of internal rotation) and for abduction (at 30 and 60 degrees of abduction). Isometric peak torque was greater than slow-speed (90 degrees per second) isokinetic peak torque, which in turn was greater than fast-speed (210 degrees per second) isokinetic peak torque. There were highly significant differences in strength, measured isokinetically and isometrically, between younger and older men and between older men and older women. The variability of normal values for torque was similar in each group. Repeat testing demonstrated a high reliability of isokinetic measurements and of isometric measurements at angles within the range of the production of peak torque. Complete testing was performed in four normal volunteers before and after a block of the suprascapular nerve. The supraspinatus and infraspinatus components of the rotator cuff contributed a variable proportion to the total strength of abduction (25 to 50 per cent) and external rotation (50 to 75 per cent) throughout the range of motion. This study demonstrated that both isokinetic and isometric testing in the scapular plane are valid methods for measurement of the strength of external rotation and abduction of the shoulder. The data support standardization of the positions for testing the strength of motions of the shoulder: isometric strength of external rotation should be measured in the scapular plane with the shoulder in 45 degrees of abduction and 45 degrees of internal rotation; isometric strength of abduction, in the scapular plane with the shoulder in 45 degrees of abduction; and isokinetic strength of external rotation and abduction, in the scapular plane at 90 degrees per second.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between muscular forces generated by the middle trapezius and pectoralis minor muscles and the position of the scapula in relaxed standing. The muscular forces of 60 subjects were measured in standard manual muscle testing positions with a hand-held dynamometer. Scapular abduction in standing was measured with a tape measure. Each measurement was taken twice, and the measurements were shown to be reliable. The correlation between scapular abduction and middle trapezius muscle force was .20. The correlation between scapular abduction and pectoralis minor muscle force was .14. The correlation between scapular abduction and a ratio of middle trapezius muscle force to pectoralis minor muscle force was .01. The results indicate that no relationship exists between the position of the scapula in standing subjects and the muscular force produced by the middle trapezius and pectoralis minor muscles. Clinical practices based on an assumed relationship between these variables (eg, the practice of using middle trapezius muscle strengthening exercises to correct a forward shoulder position) should be reexamined in light of these findings.

AB  - It is difficult to determine the size and localization of rotator cuff tears preoperatively. But with the special arthrographic technique, a diagnosis with about 80% accuracy was possible in 65 surgically confirmed rotator cuff tears. With this technique, 22 massive cuff tears were found in conservatively treated patients. In these patients, the plain roentgenograms obtained at the initial examination were also analyzed. The roentgenographic findings included narrowing of the acromiohumeral interval and degenerative changes of the humeral head, the tuberosities, the acromion, the acromioclavicular joint, and the glenohumeral joint. Based on these data, five roentgenographic grades of massive cuff tears were identified. Of seven patients with massive tears, which had been treated conservatively and followed for more than eight years, the roentgenographic grades advanced in five. One shoulder progressed to cuff-tear arthropathy. Based on these observations, it is proposed that the following pathogenetic mechanisms are responsible for the progressive roentgenographic changes: (1) arm elevation in activities of daily living, (2) rupture of the long head of biceps tendon, (3) the abnormal fulcrum of the humeral head against the acromion and the coracoacromial ligament, and (4) the weakness of external rotation. A massive cuff tear will progress to cuff-tear arthropathy, with each step of progression accompanied by characteristic roentgenographic changes.

AB  - Posture of the head, neck, and shoulders has long been recognized as a factor contributing to the onset and perpetuation of cervical pain dysfunction syndromes. Treatment regimens frequently include exercises and instruction for postural correction. Clinical assessment of posture, however, tends to be subjective in nature. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of a new objective technique of posture measurement and to establish normal standards for the technique. This study used a computer-assisted slide digitizing system called Postural Analysis Digitizing System (PADS) to determine characteristic values for head and shoulder girdle posture and characteristic range of motion for head protraction-retraction and shoulder protraction-retraction in a sample of able-bodied young men. PADS is a modification of a two-dimensional slide digitizing system developed for measuring trunk range of motion. Twenty male subjects were photographed in a neutral position, the maximally protracted position, and the maximally retracted position of the head and scapula. Ten subjects were evaluated once, and ten were evaluated twice. The slide photographs were analyzed using a computer-assisted digitizing system. Well-defined anatomic landmarks were used to determine angular relationships in the head, neck, and shoulders. The reliability of the system was tested by calculating an intraclass correlation coefficient, student t-test, and the percent error for each position. The positions were considered reproducible, and reliability of the system was considered adequate for postural analysis. Mean values for the positions were 28.48 degrees, 51.97 degrees, and 62.09 degrees for head protraction, the neutral position, and head retraction, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - This series of 93 Putti-Platt arthroplasties performed on 88 athletes without a recurrence and with the return of each athlete to full participation demonstrates the excellence of this procedure. The 5 year average follow-up further confirms this. Only one valid objection was found.
